0,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.73,"2019 vintage. Have had most of Lift Bridge's offering and found them to be good but not exceptional; Silhouette is the latter. Pours pitch black with some light barely visible at the top edge in my Spiegelau stout glass. Delicious meld of coffee and bourbon on the nose. Flavor profile goes together perfectly, not too much bourbon but the perfect amount IMHO and not too boozy but just right. Nice full body but not too much either. This is fantastic and given the choice of this or some of the better know BA stouts like BCBS, CBS or KBS I've enjoyed, I'd pick this over them."
1,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,5.0,"Was surprised to be able to find a 2012 750ml that could be consumed on site at Hill Farmstead. Beer is a murky ruby red in glass with pick 2 finger head. Aroma is a blend of sweet fruits and earthy funkiness that blends really nicely together. Taste is amazing. A perfectly blended mix of all the good things I like in a Belgian Lambic/sour and done better than most any I've had to date. It's only slightly sour, mixed with tartness and sweetness from the fruit, but finishes so clean. No syrupy sweetness on the back of the tongue like you get from some other fruit beers. It was quite the highlight of my Vermont trip to finally get to sample something from Cantillon and if I can't have it at the source in Belgium, then sitting at Hill Farmstead on a 75 degree sunny fall day sure isn't too shabby a venue either."
2,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.49,"2018 vintage. Released 2 months ago. A: Pours a thick black with just a smattering of medium brown head. No lacing and poor retention. S: Thick, sweet, rich dark cocoa, baker’s spice (cinnamon, clove) infused medium-roast coffee, medium-light bourbon and oak, dry wood, and light prunes.  T: Rich cocoa, liquid Hershey’s, moderate and well-integrated medium-roast coffee, light bourbon, lightly sweet, finishing fairly dry with a bit of cola, dry cinnamon stick, and prunes. A beer this rich could use a bit more sweetness to bring out the dessert-y flavors.  M: Thick, mouthcoating medium-full body, with moderate alcohol heat and moderate carbonation.  O: Delicious, dessert-y, and coffee forward with pretty good barrel character. About as good as BA Abraxas."
3,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.46,"Pours a hazy murky pale orange or orange with some yellow thrown in to tone it down some. Two finger off white head falls slow and laces well. Aroma is light tropical fruits with more citrus bite then the others from Trillium at least it seems so at this time. Besides the citrus and tropical fruits some pine resin mingled in there some where. This one actually smells like it might have some bitterness to it. Taste is pretty much starts fruity NEIPA style typical pineapple, mango, passion fruits but moves to more regular citrus grapefruit rind bitterness. Finish is what makes this one a little different god the grapefruit rind along with some pine like resin mingled in to add to the bitterness, like the best of both worlds. Mouthfeel is medium nice bready malt base to hold all the hops. Carbonation is little past medium to add a little zing to the beer. Overall say this is the best out of the four 4 packs I picked up at the brewery. Hopefully my ratings will reflect that but who knows what I will like on what day, lol."
4,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.46,"2015 vintage drank on 7/8/2017 Look was syrupy with decent lacing and very little head. Smell and taste were in point. Nice caramel, toffee, barrel, raisin and a little plum. Pretty creamy for a bw. Overall a pleasure to drink. One of the best in this style and glad I finally got to try this."
5,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.46,"2018 release, tried first on draft but now from a bottle. Just let it warm up, and it will reach its full potential. A bit green and bitter when cold, it releases a whole raft of brown sugar, leather, and vanilla notes as it approaches room temp. Very pleasantly oxidized even when freshly released, with solid grape, tobacco, and lightly acidic notes. A classic old ale, for sure."
6,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.18,"Traded for this a while ago, even though I have no idea when since there wasn't a date or anything else written on the bottom of the can. I haven't had much from Bissell Brothers but the beers I've been able to sample from then have led me to believe that they can brew a New England IPA as well as anyone and that was certainly the case with this beer. The pour to this was decent as the liquid was golden, murky and topped off with plenty of head. Not a lot of lacing was left behind as I worked my way through this with much of it remaining as the thin head along the top of my pint glass. The strength of this beer, as well as it's potency, lay in it's taste as the tropical, murky,and turbid nose gave a hint of what was to come once I sipped it. Melon,grass, dank hops, and overt overripe tropical fruit in the nose gave me a hint of what was to come as the dry, chalky nature of the aroma gave me a strong hint of what was to come. Tropical fruit, soft juiciness, and soft hops hit my palate from the get-go and lingered throughout my session, as they formed the backbone of this beer. A light carbonation and moderate alcoholic presence allowed the deep and dank notes of this fully emerge on my palate, as this quietly lingered and fully warmed up to my tongue and ultimately to the rest of my senses... This had enough alcohol in it but that was nearly irrelevant to everything else that was going on. Sure, lots of sediment was left at the bottom of my pint glass but that paled in comparison to the impression this left on me once the liquid fully went down. While not among the best New England IPA's or best IPA's that I've had as of late, this served as a textbook example of how wonderful this style could be. If you love brews from this neck of the woods or anything fron Bissell, seek this out. It will be well worth your effort!"
7,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.43,Pours black. Brown head. Slightly roasty mocha aroma. Woody and bourbon scents as well. Taste falls right in line with aroma. Silky smooth feel with just the right amount of carbonation.
8,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.8,"2019 consumed Dec 31, 2020. Black, small beige head, clings with some lacing. Nose of vanilla, licorice, cinnamon, slight booze. Taste leads with cinnamon, adds molasses, pepper, anise, rye boozy. Body is thick and rich, mild carbonation amplifies the rye."
9,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.35,Growler from the source. Cloudy opaque yellow/orange pour with a big white head. Big tropical fruit bouquet. The tropical fruits smash you in face right out of the gate then give way to bitter piney/resiny hop notes. Plenty of caramel malt backbeats to keep the balance in check. Peach and apricot undercurrents. Really good mouthfeel and body. This is delicious and dangerous at 8.6%....
10,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.74,"Poured from a bottle (blend 10, bottled Apr2020) into a Belgian glass L: very rich, dark ruby red with a matching (slightly lighter color) head that fades after a minute or two. Some decent bubbles around the edge S: amazing, deep raspberry nose. Like freshly puréed for a smoothie, embarrassingly reminds me of Häagen-Dazs raspberry sorbet. Little bit of funk, nice and tart, smells awesome T: follows the nose with great freshly picked raspberry flavor. Lightly tart, a little pithy, beautiful fresh fruit. Medium/long finish, nicely drying. Great flavor, more restrained than the nose if that makes sense F: medium/light body, medium carbonation, perfectly drying O: truly remarkable beer, one that lives up to the hype. Almost would have liked it as a dessert beverage, something special about it"
11,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.69,"Jet black color, more thick viscosity, tan clumpy head that is champ of retention and stickiness. Aroma was plenty of whiskey, soft charred roast, chocolate malt. Leather and oak show up like its a tree sex party. Taste is so chewy, absorbs the alcohol for you, whiskey is in a supporting role. Faint honey and vanilla. Caramel present like a boozy cracker jack, mouthfeel amazing that in a SRM this deep, it allows toffee and caramel to come through even through the whiskey and smoke. Amazing stuff, amazing circumstance, I kind of hate that I liked it so much."
12,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.54,"Bottled 07/21/17. I was expecting the cork to pop, it didn’t. The pour is very dark, light head that doesn’t last. You can smell the Pinot and cherries. None of the flavors are dominant. Really nice balance between the tart and the residual wine aspects, and just the right amount of funk. I need to try a newer bottle for comparison.  Overall a wonderful ale!"
13,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,5.0,This is one of the most unique and most impressive beers I have ever had. You get to taste every bit of the Neapolitan ice cream in the description in all the best ways. Definitely a dessert beer but not at all too sweet in my opinion. A wonderful experience
14,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.49,"Pours an inky black in the glass. Decent beige head. Smell is nuanced: roasted cocoa, vanilla, sour cherry, red grapes. Flavor is tarter than the nose suggests. Very vinous, fruit forward. Big, acidic finish but the chocolate malt backbone helps it along. The best kind of German chocolate cake."
15,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.75,A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a minuscule tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with no lacing
16,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.79,"2020 vintage boxed bottle, sampled June 2, 2021. Appearance: Bonus points for the nice box, beer is black and shows clear ruby edges with strong back light. A short lived tan head dropped off to a thin halo that doesn't lace. Aroma: Heavy dark malt, bourbon barrel, dark fruit. Taste: Starts a little sweet, deep malt bill, then a toffee middle goes into an almost sharp bourbon barrel, hop bitter, hot alcohol finish. All of it glorious. Mouthfeel: Sultry. Silky smooth, low carbonation, medium heavy body, slight chew, a little warm on the finish but fairly clean. Overall: Wow. It deserves the big numbers. Huge flavor, no flaws (but, it would be hard to tell), alcohol is kept low key and felt more than tasted. Boozy, malty, silky, hints of citric peek through, very complicated but well packaged taste profile. Easy drinking, it's a treat!"
17,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.35,"Yeah, this was old but like so many cans in my stash, I have no idea when this was brewed as there wasn't anything written on the bottom of it. This was a must-have because of it's rating on here and even though this was old, this was such a hop bomb that I had to take my time sipping this. Yes, this beer was quite intense but it was worth the effort to enjoy as the label was quite indicative of what the liquid was like! Hazy, amber, and not topped off with a lot of head, there was lots of debris floating in this but surprisingly, the lacing left behind wasn't that thick at all. Hop oils. tropical fruits, weed, and nectar filled the nose as they could all be found in the taste as well. Lychee, passion fruit, star fruit, jack fruit, and orange blossom filled the palate as the taste was quite complex and rich while being dry at the same time. Hoppy, herbal, and underlying sweet, this had a subtle but long-lasting stickiness that was indicative of this beer's makeup as it was hard to put away; while being hard to resist at the same time. Plenty of booze here but it was felt more than tasted although I could feel it creeping up on my well before I finished this off. A deep, fresh, dank pine tied everything in together as it was felt from the first sip until well after the last drop went down. If you like your beers to be complex and engrossing at the same time, you've found you're match here. This was a solid brew that deserves it's lofty rating on here even though I wasn't quite gung-ho about it as others on here have been. It's easy to see why this is so loved, as it's a must-have for anyone looking for the best of what a New England IPA has to offer. Just make the time to savor this properly!"
18,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.31,Canned 11/5/20
19,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.02,"Yeah, my can of this is old - really old (7/21/16) but this is a classic and I vowed to have it, along with everything else in my basement, before it burst or broke. Even though this was quite a bit of a malt bomb when I opened it, it wasn't bad and was still enjoyable to a large extent. Very little sediment was poured out as well, which made the experience that much better! Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a muted peach with a ton of cloudiness to it. The head was sufficient and there was a bit of lacing here and there after the thin collar at the top, but it wasn't terribly thick or bright. Not a lot of pine in the nose but there was enough orange, tangerine, and cream in the nose to keep this soft. The clementine and rind came through in the taste along with a citrus sweetness that made this quite soft and easy to drink. A mild dank hop presence came through in the aftertaste and it was no secret that this felt like a malt bomb, given how much was in here. Loads of wheat gave this body as this was not terribly juicy nor dry from start to finish... Just the right amount of alcohol was present too, as I felt a bit of warming but not enough to serve as a deterrent. This was a nice beer that had everything in proportion and was quite easy to quaff. I have no idea who Paul and Jess are but if they had this at their wedding, it would have been a great choice!"
20,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.41,"2018 vintage, 12.7 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass."
21,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.75,"Dated 1/29/19, drank on 2/15/19 Look (4.75): opaque golden orange. Nice 1.5 finger foamy head."
22,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,5.0,"I know it looks foolish to do all 5s. But this ""beer"" is off the charts. The taste is more like a (non-carbonated) sherry-cognac with a maple overtone. At 28% alcohol, these brews last for a very long time. My collection goes back 10 years. The 2009, opened for a decade, still tastes great. I just have tiny sips, so I can extend the experience over the years."
23,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.99,This beer is by far Tree House's best beer....and that is saying a lot. This beer doesn't leave any doubt that they are the kings of the NEIPA. They even have the hop bite to end this just the way I love it.
24,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.0,"Creamy-looking dark OJ color with a thin finger of off-white head. Nice lacing. Huge aroma of weed, earthy smoked herbs and nuts. They carry over the taste, coupled with orange juice, lime, pithy and piney bitterness and a peppery alcohol bite. Some hop bite, too. Full bodied with a prickly feel. There’s a lot of depth and ton of alcohol in this one, but the nutty, smokey quality when fresh isn’t to my preference. I am interested to see how it changes with some age."
25,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.52,"Season 17/18. Bottles 22 Mar 18.  Pours out a beautiful, deep red. Almost like a shining black cherry. Forms sea foam pink bubbles throughout the pour that noisily dissipate as quick as they form. Beautiful clarity.  The nose brings flowery/powdery aspect mixing with fruit. Tart cherries, black cherries, raspberries.  The taste brings in flowers, cherries, raspberries. Once it’s gone, the carbonation leaves you burping up rotten, skunky, funky fruit. Love it.  The mouthfeel has enough carbonation to lead to a burp it seems like after every drink. Mildly tart, greatly balanced.  Overall, it’s a beautiful beer."
26,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.42,"Split the 2018 version with 2 friends. I'll blame the perpetual hype but IMHO this was just a pretty good vanilla stout. Not 5 times better than FO, certainly not 2-3 times as good as Henna marshmallow. Yes the vanilla balance was perfect but honestly it started to wobble a bit as it warmed up. Not worth the price tag, hoping for a different variant this year."
27,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.34,Look - fantastic black and thick with a great lasting tan head and rimming
28,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.71,"My first Trillium beer, have to figure out how to get more regularly!  Canned on 6/10/18, poured from can into tulip glass 10/2/18. Guessing I missed some of the highlights here but this is still a great beer. Murky orange-yellow pour with large foamy head that quickly disappears leaving a little lacing. Juicy citrus with a touch of sweetness to it on the nose. Clean, crisp taste with touch of hoppy bitterness to finish. Delicious beer, wish I was closer so I could get more of their stuff regularly."
29,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.32,Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter. 2019 release. 
30,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.61,"04/2014 - The nose is notably tart, a touch yeasty, yet notable peach and apricots; funky, lactic, pucker all over the palate, with juicy fruit lasting and lasting; there's a unique bitterness in back, but the aforementioned characteristics, namely the the peach and lactic linger."
31,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.61,"Uhm, yum. Bourbon up front, bourbon in the nose, with a sweet, not cloying, aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full. Not warming, don’t taste the alcohol, but wow does it smack you in the head! I might revise my rating later when I’m not so smashed!"
32,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.25,"L: Pitch black with a small head, tan head."
33,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.72,"Look: dark amber, big cream head Smell: malt, plums, rasins, hops Taste: lots of malt and dark fruit sweetness, with a nice floral hop  Feel: smooth, nice small bubbles on the tongue"
34,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.52,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a very prominent and pleasant cinnamon and vanilla. Taste is also a prominent cinnamon and pleasant vanilla accent and prominent chili burn.
35,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.0,"750ml bottle thanks to Rick. Inky black pour, small beige head. Roast grains, coffee, cinnamon on the aroma. Taste brings a bit of ashy notes, more of the roast grains, mild coffee, cinnamon, french toast without the syrup."
36,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.09,tasted 3/5/21. Poured from a can dated 12/23/20.
37,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.25,A: Hazy yellow gold with nice white foamy head and sticky lacing. 
38,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.44,"Purple bowling ball so it must be the 2016 version. This one has been on my once list for a very long time so I am very excited to try it. The smell is very much like German chocolate cake. The sweetness of this beer is something that really grips you right off the bat. Smooth astringent, cordial like alcohol blends nicely with cocoa and chocolate icing. This brew is very cake like throughout. Lots of dark chocolate with hints of black cherry. I would love to try maybe a rye barrel aged version of this."
39,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,3.93,Shared a 375 from the most recent batch with my brother. This was my first beer from side project and I think he gave away a little much for it. I like this beer overall and was very drinkable. I thought while tart and sour it wasn't over the top like some are saying. At the same time it wasn't very bold. I could have crushed the whole bottle to myself easily but in the same vain of IPAs I'm not really a session guy. Just expected something more.
40,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,5.0,"Just a perfect beer. The mix of flavors is incredible. Imagine the ideal cross scoop out of a pint of Neapolitan ice cream, with the barrel to balance the strawberry goodness. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on one of these."
41,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.31,"2018 vintage.  A: Pours black with a smattering of fairly fine, dark brown head that recedes quickly to a razor thing ring. A couple dots of lacing. S: Vanilla, dark chocolate, delicious bourbon and oak, mint, light roast.   T: Cola, dark cacao chocolate bar, mint, bourbon, oak, hint of burnt coffee, along with light sweetness. Finishes with sort of a gritty dark cocoa and cola flavor. Hefty bourbon contribution that doesn’t overpower the rest.   M: Full bodied with medium, cola-like carbonation. Light but smooth alcohol warmth.   O: Tasty stuff, like a more refined version of BBS with similar bourbon and coke type flavors. The burnt note is a little distracting but still a solid beer."
42,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.99,"Imcredible beer. Only had a small 3 oz sample at the FWIBF into a 6 oz snifter. The stone fruit shines and is comimented nicely with the puckering sour of the lactic acid. For a Side Project, these brews continue to take on starring roles!"
43,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.3,"14 January 2020 - Beer #8 Appearance: 5 - nearly black black with an incredibly frothy nitro head that just won't quit. Nose: 5 - plenty of barrel and an absolute blast of coconut. Can't wait to dive in. Taste: 4 - really good, but a bit too sweet. TONS of coconut. Very tasty but just too cloying. Mouth: 4 - surprisingly thin for nitro. Sticky but not thick. Overall: 4 - a decadent night cap, but just a tier below what I expected. Cheers!"
44,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.55,Thank you Vidblain for this
45,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.41,"On tap at Bayberry Beer Hall in RI, pours a murky hazed yellow, small white head that fades fast The smell is incredible here, an overload of papaya, banana, pineapple, orange and mango, just the lightest hop bite to back it up The taste is a bit of a letdown compared to the aroma but still awesome. I get piney, resinous hops, a light florality, very tropical The feel is nice and prickly, pretty highly carbonated and drinks medium bodied Some pretty amazing stuff right here, super easy drinking but still really interesting"
46,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.63,"Batch 4, poured into a tulip. Crisp and tart with a really nice soft mouthfeel and a bit of funkiness - I could drink this everyday. Looking forward to seeing how this one develops!"
47,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.6,"Double Nelson pours a murky golden orange color with a small quarter inch, white head, which settles quickly, rimming the glass and some very spotty lacing. The smell is quite dank, with a grassy, earthy weed and pine softened by citrus fruits of orange, pineapple, some white grape with some nice malts and assorted grains resulting in a creamy aroma. Wow! Nothing short of excellent! Lush and creamy over the palette making this very easy drinking. Hints of white wine, grass an herbal notes with grapefruit and pineapple with some pricky spiciness but a soft texture all the way through."
48,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.3,"Had Triple Sunshine poured from 12-oz. can, bottom stamped ""CANNED ON 07/07/20,"" gift from friend, into Teku tulip 3.0. Pours bright gold with one finger of near-white head, which doesn't last and leaves only a little lace. Give this one time. Cold off the pour, it's pine-sol. As it warms, or if you start it closer to proper temp., it's floral and fruity, pineapple, tropical funk, and backing malt. On drinking, it's funky, brandied fruit, over big malt, with alcohol warming up the finish."
49,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.29,"On tap at Hops and Pie. Extremely purple with a pink head, vibrant colors. Smells like a jar of raspberry preserves, very jammy and fruity. Sweetness as well. Flavor was mostly raspberry preserves and a slight sourness. I understand now why people might seek out Jester King."
50,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.19,Bottle. Dark brown pour with a kaki head. Huge sweet caramel and vanilla aromas. Massive vanilla gives way to sweet fudge and caramel notes. A hint of bitter roasted malts and booze on the backend. Really good mouthfeel. Average body.
51,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.49,Type: 16-oz. draft
52,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.7,"Thanks to Chris the local guy for this 750ML bottle. Sampled this previously but never sat down with a full pour & very happy to do so. Split with my wife.  The pour is surprisingly light, a muddly brown rather than abyssian darkness. Head vanishes quickly to nothing. The nose is just as advertised: chocolate, roast, booze, barrel. Meets expectations like rear-ended Ford Pinto.  Mocha Wednesday is boozier than waking up inside a bourbon barrel; now I know how the dwarves felt on the Forest River (well, kind of). Massive hit of alcohol & bourbon in yo face, & my feet feel suddenly further away. Large scale sweetness from the malts, chocolate, roast that’s quieter than the nose would suggest. Underneath the chaos is molasses & something else I could identify if I wasn’t already drunk. Thick, decadent, & would pair well with my wife’s lovely Bailey’s cheesecake. Mmmmm. Love this. Could have taken it solo.  Pastry stout has been used as a recent epitaph, but in my mouth it’s a viral compliment. Hand me a glass of this anytime. An elite beer that improves marginally on the near perfection that is Black Tuesday. Please help me up the stairs if you see me napping somewhere other than my bed later. Thanks in advance."
53,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.83,"From a 16oz can dated 11/12/20. Message on can: ""Whatever you do, do it well."" Pours an dense opaque brownish orange with about one finger of pale yellow head. Great retention, unreal lacing. I maybe could have dinged it a quarter point for the small head but the denseness of the color more than made up for it. Smells...the nose on this thing! Unbelievable. Rich pineapple, orange, nectarine, peach, tangerine and grapefruit. Just a bit of herbal, earthy aroma in the background. Taste. Don't know how they did this but while there is some citrus in the background, hop bitterness is front and center. Picking up a pleasant citrus acidity.  Mouthfeel is thick and sticky but highly drinkable-very smooth. Strong bitter aftertaste. Low carbonation. Overall. Wow. Just Wow. This beer is about as close to perfect as you can get."
54,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.21,"May 10th, 2016 - Rounding up the trio of Alesmith Stouts and their different flavor variants is the Barrel Aged version of the OG, with a high price, an ABV and my high expectations. The smell is potent, even from a 4 oz. taster glass, and shows off the barrel aging and oak nicely. The flavor is also exceptionally smooth, strong and potent, with a solid hit of alcohol, and a good bourbon taste. Solid, meaty and strong, it's a triple threat, and definitely worth of following the other Speedway styles. September 3rd, 2015 - The Alesmith Vietnamese Coffee stout is a premier beer, but the Bourbon Barrel Aged version is no slouch. With a smooth, opalescent look it offers classic and classy alcohol and oak notes, smoldering with ethanol. The taste is much gentler, both sweet and delicate, but also bold and robust. A licorice sweetness mixes with the taste of Japanese whisky, and a thinner palate let's everything shine through."
55,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.35,"Pours a clouded amber to orange color with a fizzy, small head, which immediately diminishes to a small coating. Smells of leaf wrapped ripe peaches, offering a bright fruitiness, which comes close to actually cut a peach into half and enjoy its aromas. This inherits not only the fruit‘s pulp but also its stone pith quality, adding a soft soothing quality to the sprizzy, slightly perfumy and floral fruits. Has a higher, finely nuanced carbonation, with an effervescent finish, among a lighter, yet versatile and intense lighter body. While this is doubtlessly focussed entirely on peaches, the flavors of the beer offer an initial mineralic quality, white bread dough and matured, still slightly bitter herbs. Peaches enter the palate with an early fruit sugar peak, which stays till the end, but fades down slowly and constantly. The fruit itself is defined by a pleasant tartness, sweeter peach pulp, a light moldy touch among a flowery mildness, which allows a rustic barnyard profile, consisting of leather and cream cheese, to cut through. Develops an almost creamy finish with an astonishing smoothness of the fruits and a finely beaded mouthfeel, leading to a surprising, well interweaved juiciness, in which the maintaining tartness manages to shine.  This tastes great, everything comes together perfectly, due to the beer‘s awesome mouthfeel and balance. It is just as complex as a Lambic with a cleverly integrated tartness, labeling this unmistakably a sour, but with a complexity which assures to be able to pick up the beer‘s subtle nuances."
56,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.49,"2016 vintage, poured into a tulip. Nice roasted coffee (still), coupled with some detectable vanilla creaminess/sweetness. Nice mouthfeel, highly impressed."
57,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.97,"A: Pours the usual dark-ish super hazy yellow color. The head is pure white and looks very creamy. Retention and lacing are pretty good. The look of the beer is 100% NEIPA. S: The nose is pure mangoes, juicy orange, light pine resin, mint leaves, peaches and even a very faint strawberry note. Superbly complex yet coherent. Very fresh. T: The tastes is exactly like the smell, except for more pine resin than in the nose. You get a ton of mangoes, orange (juice and peel), mint leaves, peaches and again a light strawberry note. Incredibly fresh with no malt notes whatsoever. No chalk at all. M: As with all Hill Farmstead brews I had, the mouthfeel is just perfect. Incredibly light and fluffy. The extremely low amount of residual sugars makes this beer not sticky at all too. O: IMO, this is on par with Lawson's Double Sunshine as the best IPA I've ever had. This one is a bit drier but more complex on the fruit notes and fresher in the mouth with the notes of mint."
58,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.75,"Regardless of opinion on this brewery socially, to me their dark stuff is so far amazing. The coffee is super background here but the chocolate and bourbon flavor is excellent, maple is subtle as well but I wasn't surprised there. Overall it was a quality product."
59,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.56,"Funky hazy tart beer, a true Belgium lambic. We toured the brewery - so cool! One of only breweries in Belgium that did not close or convert to munitions during WWII."
60,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.97,"Appearance: murky and cloudy bright yellow Aroma: fresh ripe peaches! Very pleasant, eventually smells like the Jolly Ranchers Peach when it warms up. The sourness is there but it's like an afterthought. Taste: very sour upfront and then the peaches just works its way in. Noticeable at first but as it warms up, it's full blown fresh tart peaches! One sip after another is really like taking a bite out of a peach, but on top of that you add complexity as it's highly sour. I do not notice trace of oak or whatever it was aged in, but that's okay, it's over abundant in peaches. Mouthfeel: medium bodied with a sour bite in the mouth  Overall: it's definitely in the top 3 is sours I've tried. I only wish I get to try this again."
61,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,3.96,"750ml bottle dated 06/2014. This wasn't totally flat, there was a tiny bot of fizz. Dark pink color. Aroma was great, lots of raspberry and lambic. The flavor was alright, it was slightly sour, raspberries but honestly I was expecting to be blown away and I wasn't. This was a good framboise but I preferred Hommage."
62,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.38,"A 22 fl. oz. bomber, 2016 Reserve, bottled on 8th December 2016. Poured into a snifter glass. Appearance: Very dark brown to black in colour with a nice one finger brown head that had decent retention, while leaving lots of nice spotty lacing. Aroma: Dark malt, moderate roast, chocolate, sweet notes, licorice, molasses, bourbon, oak. Taste: Light bitterness, roasted malts, dark chocolate, light char, sweet notes, brown sugar, licorice, molasses, oak and bourbon on the finish. Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall: An excellent classic Imperial Stout with lots of great flavours and not too sweet. A wonderful and enjoyable sipper."
63,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.5,"Smells of chocholate with some coffee flavors. This beer is definitely bitter and embodies the true porter feeling. It's not sweet at all. Robust, and a good portrayal of this style."
64,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.75,Pours a hazy copper to amber in color. Head is frothy white that dissipates quickly. Nose is pungent and aromatic. Taste is WOWZA! Very flavorful from the hops. Slightly citrus. Great bitter bite that grabs hold of the back of the tongue. Superb beer.
65,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,2.63,"This is a strange one. I love imperial stout especially big strong ones. However I prefer them a bit drier I suppose. This is much too cloyingly sweet for me. The nose is mostly chili. It looks decent like thick motor oil has legs. No head to speak of though. As I said taste is too sweet. I don’t get much other than booze and the chilis. Mouthfeel is super thick. Overall disappointed I paid so much for the bottle. I usually go for even more Jesus love that one way more, or Stone IRS. I have had so many of the style I enjoy a lot, can’t say this was one of them."
66,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.8,"A 750ml bottle, batch 2, bottled on 26th March 2016 and a best before date of 26th October 2026. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen funnel and decanter, decanted for 60 to 90 minutes and poured into a 3 Fonteinen Zenne glass. Appearance: A mostly clear golden orange colour with a minimal white head and sparse to no lacing. Aroma: Earthy funk, barnyard, hay, oak, nutty, sherry, peach and lemon. Taste: Complex flavours. Funky, earthy, barnyard, sour, lemon, grape, apricot, sherry and oak with a hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall: Wow, such complexity and goodness from a beer. Amazing and well balanced. Now I really want to try this side by side with the sherries and even batch 1, if at all possible."
67,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.75,"2015 vintage. Tart raspberries with typical funk. Had the 2012 Kriek and the 2013 side by side. The kriek was a touch superior, followed closely by the framboise."
68,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.5,"A pint can gifted from a friend. And what a gift. As soon as the can was opened, I knew it'd taste as great as it smelled, but it was even better. Not much head retention but to me that's not a biggie. There's nothing I can offer regarding the taste that wouldn't be superfluous to what's been said before. You owe it to yourself to try this beer if you can."
69,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.64,"A; I was a bad boy and poured a touch into a glass to see what I was drinking. Pours a beautiful golden hazy orange/yellow, small amount of white head dissipating quickly. S; This smells incredible. Tropical fruits, grapefruit, dank/grassy notes. T; Massive onslaught of dank, earthy, weedy notes, with bright citrus and tropical fruits mixing in. M; Unbelievably smooth, medium body, excellent carb, great! O; So glad I got a chance to try this after all these years, shout out to @tasterschoice62 for giving me the chance. Lives up to the hype for sure. Just had the perfect balance of hop onslaught, mouthfeel, bitterness."
70,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.24,canned 02/19/19 L- The beer pours a hazy golden with about a 1 cm white head. The head recedes fairly quickly into a thin film leaving spotty lacing.
71,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.46,"Pouring from a 16 oz. can into a Trillium Willi Becher style glass, this beer pours out like a cross between mango and orange juice. Forms a thin crown that dissipates to only an outer ring, attached to the glass.  The nose brings a beautiful citrus mixing with a very natural, sweet honey. Wow. The way the two mix are amazing. Mango, orange, peach, honey and caramel all backed by a dank background.  The taste comes in with those dank, pronounced layers of citrus tangling through sweet layers of honey and caramel; slight bubblegum wants to come out but never does with much pronunciation, just as an accent. There are some floral notes, but not too pronounced.  Fairly clean with little to no sharpness; slight bitterness but overall smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel.  Overall, I love the way the honey and layers of sweetness interact with the pungent, citrus, earthy hops. It’s a smooth, enjoyable brew."
72,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.47,Type: 12-oz. bottle
73,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.21,"Pouring from a 2016 750 ml. bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out very light in color for the style, just like the rest of the series. Doesn't form a crown, only an outer ring of bubbles attaching themselves to the glass. The smell is big boozy raisins and plums with slight chocolate as well. This whole series has had huge dark fruit notes. It just smells like you're going to get drunk. The taste comes in hot with booze and the dark fruit remains. This is the version aged on hazelnuts, but honestly how would you ever know with a beer this boozy? I do think I like this one better than the rest, but they just still don't hold up to the caliber I thought they would bring."
74,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.5,"Combined notes for Batch 1 and Batch 2. Really nice apricot notes and a bit creamy. Batch 2 was a bit too acidic for my taste, though I'm fairly sensitive to that. As with Fou Foune, would prefer to drink this one as fresh as possible to avoid too much acid buildup."
75,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,5.0,"Pours black. Smells of Charred oak, vanilla, and a caramel. Tastes amazingly of the bourbon barrels and caramel. very viscous. This is a Barrel aged stout at its finest."
76,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.51,"2015 bottle poured into a snifter A: Pours nearly black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a thin layer and leaves a little spotty lacing. S: Liquid candy bar, milk chocolate, hazelnut, bourbon, a bit of spice, brown sugar, vanilla, faint oak, and a nip of alcohol on the back end. T: Roasty, big milk chocolate, smooth bourbon, nice hit of hazelnut, brown sugar and toffee, vanilla, a little spice, a bit of oak, and a touch of alcohol poking through, though not unpleasant.  M: Full body, mild carbonation, a little warmth, yet creamy smooth. O: The Bruery doing what they do. Massive brew, but well balanced. Not complaining about this being a 1 and done. It's aged beautifully."
77,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.42,L: Dark mahogany with a reddish tint. Slight reddish amber head
78,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.7,"2018 release.  A: Viscous black with a thin ring of fine, dark brown head. Decent retention and no lacing.  S: Toasted coconut, vanilla ice cream, with moderate spiced rum, cinnamon, and a bit of dark chocolate and roast. T: Spiced rum in the forefront with light toasted coconut (lighter than on the nose), vanilla bean, a bit of cola and roast, with moderate bakers spices on the backend. Medium sweetness pulls things together. M: Thick medium-full body, sticky, with medium cola-like carbonation.  O: Delicious! The barrel is nicely integrated and the coconut and rum are both super tasty."
79,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.29,"Pours black, little bit of light brown foam. Smell of high quality rum, tobacco, coconut. Thick, smooth, and fairly sharp boozy. Taste is rum forward, the good way. Sweet, herbal, coconut and plenty of licorice. Not as paradisial as I was expecting."
80,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.67,12 oz can from egrandfield
81,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.45,"Pours a very dark brown, or more so, it's black with brown shining through the edges. Its a blood-burgundy color with a clear transparency when direct sunlight pierces it. Head is a finger of khaki-caramel foam after a slow pour, but it fizzles out quickly. Aroma is raisins, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate and roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty and caramely malts. Heat is seeping through pretty heavy with a whollop of bourbon booze at the back. Flavor profile is raisins, figs, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate, molasses and syrup with hearty roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely and bready malts. It's thick, thick and thick. Drinking a boozy cookie. Bourbon adds heat that seems in and lingers long after the malts wash away. A touch of char adds a little grounding bitterness for the sugary initiation. Mouth feel is thick, sticky, velvety and chewy. Overall, thick and boozy with a lot of complexities. It's super rich and full, which is what you'd imagine out of an 20% ABV beer.  Served in a glencairn glass from a 750mL bottle. 2017 vintage, served & reviewed in May of 2020."
82,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,5.0,"This is the number 2 ranked Oatmeal Stout on this site, behind one of my favorite beers of all time, Founders Breakfast Stout, and that ranking is more than well deserved.  What works the most for me is aging it on cinnamon. Oatmeal stouts shouldn’t have spice or heat, I thought, until I had this beer. The cinnamon is premonitory on the scent in a strong way, as it is the strongest characteristic on the nose. And then I taste it and I’d swear it’s a cinnamon beer. That’s not a bad thing, because wow! I don’t think I’ve ever had a beer that is this spice forward without overpowering everything else. Plenty of roasty malt and a strong bourbon presence, but that spiciness makes this a unique experience.  Medium to big bodied feel, which is surprising, cause I expected this to be a big ass beer. It’s not, nor is it thick or sticky or oily. It’s a kind of “medium in all ways” type of feel, if that makes sense, except it as boozy as hell, which is another turn on for it. Honestly, this may be one of the best beers I’ve had in a while, and I wish I could order more from Tavour. When you encounter a just about perfect beer, you know it. I’m not one of those guys who doesn’t give perfect scores, and maybe this isn’t perfect. Maybe if I examine it more, I’d lower it. But with the impression I’ve gotten over the last two hours letting it develop, I’m going with 5’s across the board right now. I’m glad I got into Tavour just because of Fremont access."
83,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.73,Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold. Huge citrus and fruity aroma. Taste is a tons of citrus but not a juice bomb. You get some bitterness but not overly bitter. Just a perfect balanced hazy ipa.
84,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.6,"This is everything it says on the bottle - it’s definitely a porter (and a gorgeous one at that), with a body that verges in black with mahogany on the edges and a dense light tan head. And the maple literally grabs you by the throat when you pop the top on the bottle - and then the coffee jumps in, and there’s an earthy salty note as well. The maple and coffee are the leads on the taste, but the star is the salty flavor that comes with some chocolate and char notes. The mouthfeel approaches creamy, which is to style with this non-imperial porter. This may be the best beer I’ve had in 2020, and possibly back to 2019. It’s breakfast in a beer, and is truly a pleasure to drink."
85,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.74,"Acquired in a trade. Poured into TH snifter with maximum foam head. 4 finger plus. Look: Deep black, well blended. Perfect foam building head that lingered for days."
86,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.44,"Super hazy yellow-orange color with a thick white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet citrus and some piney hop aromas in there as well. Tastes of melony and citrusy hops, slight hint of pine at the very backend of it. Feels silky, smooth, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall an excellent beer!"
87,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.33,Jjjuliusss! from Treehouse. Received on 9/4/21 from @Rub_This_BBQ in NBW BIF #13. 16 oz can stored upside-down at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 13/4/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
88,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.46,"L: Slightly Hazy orange/yellow with no head and a touch of lacing. S: Pine resin, Ruby red grapefruit, pineapple and a touch of candied crystal malt. T: Firm bitterness, moves into flavors of pine, citrus pith, pineapple, and grapefruit. Solid malt flavor that is not disruptive. F: Medium bodied, dry with clean finish. Overall: A stellar DIPA with tons of aroma and flavor. Good even by Vermont standards."
89,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.65,"pours thin white head, reduced to medium lacing and thin cap aromas of pineapple, papaya, mango, grassy, citrus as in orange hints of floral.  Taste is juicy and a hint of spice piney notes.  Mouthfeel is full and juice bomb like. Semi sweet lending to a citrus rind bitterness type of finish.  Overall it's a nicely balanced beer, very easy drinking, no alcohol taste to speak of. I feel it's one of their better ones."
90,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,3.74,"Surprisingly clear for the flavors it has. Pours a straw gold, no haze. Smell is citrusy and hoppy, some pine, some bitter, some resin. Taste follows suit. Feel is oily and mouth coating. Decent beer, nothing I haven’t already had though."
91,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,3.62,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a fairly clear orange copper in color with a thin cap of off white foam. Fair retention though settling to some spottiness. Bold hop aromas on the nose, coupled with some some honey rich malt notes and a waft of ethanol. Doesn't exactly blast the hops as you gotta get into the glass to find them. Taste seems a bit muddled with sweetness evident on the finish. Not a whole lot of malt character as honey notes take center stage but do mask the alcohol well. Some citric hop spice on the finish breaks the monotony to a degree and keeps the mouthfeel from being overly cloying given the ABV.  Overall a decent quaff but not what I expected from such a highly lauded brew. We'll see if a little warming improves things. Packaged 1/15/2021 so just two weeks in the bottle."
92,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.85,"2019 Reserve The look is beautiful. Dark and opaque black with a tinted head. Smells great. Cherry hit first followed by a kind of dark roast coffee. The chocolate tones are there but not as strong as the others. Some oak.  The taste is very good. Not too boozy but you can tell it’s bourbon aged. Was worried about the liquorice making it weird, but it didn’t do that at all. Overall taste is cherry, chocolate, malt, coffee. Surprisingly well balanced by the bourbon and chocolate. This stout is just sweet enough to taste quite good without being too sweet. I love it. The feel is sort of light for an imperial stout. This is preference thing but, given the taste, the mouthfeel is a little odd. Still, it’s above average so don’t worry too much about that. Overall this stout is world class. Not the best in the world, but definitely up there and I think it deserves the 99. Only downside for me was price. I ended up getting 2 bottles for $60 which is steep but eh whatever. I cellared this stout for a year before opening. I’ve heard the taste is too intense if opened right away, but a year of sitting had it end up perfect."
93,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.89,"Canned on 3/3/20 Pours a turbid light honey gold body capped with a finger and a half of creamy, white foam; solid head retention yields an expansive frothy collar and vague, paper-thin cap, with chunky rings and light, soapy spots rounding the walls of the glass. Aroma opens with soft but assertive key lime cream doused with hits of mango and a passionfruit edge; orange pulp develops across the middle as a dank, earthy tangerine accents the close. Taste brings out orange and grapefruit pulp before a passionfruit and dirt-covered papaya tropical zest highlights the core of the profile; a faint note of creamy tangerine along with dank herbs fades into the backdrop. Mouthfeel offers a moderate verging on dense body supported by a mild but fluffy carbonation; a pithy mid-palate featuring a rising hop acidity becomes a touch juicy over time, though primarily highlighting an easy hoppy grit and drying into a resinous finish. Recalling bursts of Other Half's signature creaminess and harmony of tropical dank and raw earth, this DIPA manages a more raw spread of individual elements falling just short of real cohesion. Highly enjoyable in spite of missing the character to bring it to the upper-tier of the style."
94,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.93,"Ah yes, breakfast with the baby....this is the first stout I really appreciated. Once I started letting it warm a bit from fridge temp it really blossomed. It's also a best buy at $9.99 a 4-pack."
95,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.0,"L: Medium opiate amber in color minimal head that hands on the glass. S: Sweet fragrance of passion fruit and oranges. T: Hoppy dank start, orange-grapefruit-apricots notes in the middle, then a hoppy sweet finish with a slight bitter ending. More danky than juicy. F: Medium bodied with a dry finish O: Hoppy west coast IPA, very different beer from what you smell vs what you taste. Like a sweeter Pliny the Elder."
96,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.06,"Pours a semi clear amber with fine head. Smell is piney with notes of resin, grapefruit an grapefruit rind. Taste is piney and citrus with a strong, resiny bitterness. There is a medicinal hint that hampers it somewhat and makes it a little bit astringent. Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated. Overall, a very nice west coast DIPA, shame about the medicinal thing."
97,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.74,"2009 batch 2 bottle. Poured into a Torst glass. Dark blue/purple in color. Minimal head. So much blueberry! Smells amazing with blueberry and funk. Some mustiness in there too. Flavors are blueberry abound. Can’t believe how much fruit is present for a 9 year old bottle. Tons of blueberry with some funk. Super balanced. Feel is thick for the style, probably because of the amount of blueberry in it. Overall, this is fantastic. Just an amazing lambic!"
98,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.37,"September 3rd, 2015 - When I leave San Diego, this will probably be the most memorable beer of the many, many beers I had. For one, I had it at one of my first visits to any brewery since moving to San Diego. But it is also an amazing brew. To the eye it looks like a somewhat intense stout, with a brown foam and a thick body, but not too oily. The aroma is big and bold, and cold and saturnine, like the smell of cold metal, but with some cacao nibs on the edge. The flavor is the real appeal here. Creamy, rich but not cloying, it is decadent, and deserving. Huge gushing chocolate notes combine with deluxe and top-shelf coffee notes, like Bird Rock coffee. Better yet, this beer gets spicier as it warms, like a Christmas ale, and reveals shades of nutmeg and cinnamon. Could this be a rare 10 for flavor?!"
99,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,3.91,"Excited to finally have a Utopias. Only a 2019 but the experience of unboxing it and pouring the bottle is second to none. Sharing this bottle with my bud Rug. Based off looks, phenomenal. Never before had to unbox a beer. Smells strong, gives a bourbon vibe and hints of cinnamon. Slightly burns to smell but that’s to be expected with a beer of this alcohol percentage. Tastes strongly of maple syrup, and bourbon. Hints of cinnamon in the background. Medium feel, finishes sticky. Overall a phenomenal experience. Not anything phenomenal to the senses, but one any craft beer fan should have."
100,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.35,"Pouring a slick, stark black ribbon and filling to matte black, Black Gold has a thin but dense and uniform mocha-gold blanket that settles only to a thin ring around the rim. I could smell this all day. Black Gold has a very maple-forward character that's slightly smoky, sticky and sweet, and very rich. Nutty and surprisingly peppery oak follows with notes of chocolate wafer and a dollop of vanilla whip cream. A faint sting of bourbon complexity comes out at the end of an inhale, bringing with it a hint of caramel and candy corn. It immediately strikes me how very dry and very woody yet somehow not hot this is at first taste, which is a telling mark of excellent blending. Taste verges away from the maple in the aroma, and instead goes in the direction of toasted coconut and smooth vanilla with an unbelievably delectable char that rises after the swallow. It's kind of like salted caramel and brownie crust, but quite notably mature, particularly as it warms, when mocha liqueur and tobacco develop. The medium body is supported by a mildly firm and satisfying fizz before a semi-dry, slightly sticky finish. A building warmth comes up quite a while after the swallow, but there's amazingly little heat on the front or middle."
101,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.54,"Boy oh boy. You take an already infamous beer and up the ante by adding vanilla and cocoa. Gnarly. It's a beastly beer that is a true sipper if Ive ever seen one. It's rich, dark, heavy, sweet and delicious. The addition of cocoa and vanilla add flavor to a beer that, honestly, didnt really need any help but somehow serves as an upgrade. Great beer, share it with good friends, dont drive afterward."
102,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.18,Bottle Date: best by August 2022
103,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.29,"Tasted in a snifter from draft at The Vine on June 22, 2019. Bold, strong and dark. Made by adding vanilla and Tampa roasted espresso beans to a formidable double stout base."
104,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.56,"Dated 6/19/19 on the bottom of the can, 6 weeks since brewing. Pours an extremely hazy, nearly opaque pale yellow with a finger of fluffy head. Nose bursting with candied peach, pineapple, mango, resin, fresh herbaceousness, lychee, Portuguese breadiness, hint of bubblegum, slight mushroomy earthiness and a little belgian spice. Taste is fresh tropical fruit for days, lingering around your tastebuds for quite a while, wonderful. Low carbonation, soft medium- body but slightly watery. Low bittering/drying. Probably the best pale I've ever had, both bursting with flavor and deeply refreshing. Could CRUSH a 4 pack of these in a heartbeat."
105,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.0,"Wow was this overrated. I couldn't beleive it when I saw that this was my variant. Had a blind BBA Vanilla beer tasting with family. Handjee, Bourbon County Vanilla, Fundamental Observation, Vlad Vanilla & French Vanilla Militia."
106,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.28,"A: The beer is very cloudy whitish yellow in color, which becomes darker towards the bottom of the can. It poured with a half finger high bright white head that quickly died down, leaving lacing on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass."
107,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,3.69,"2018 bottle poured into large snifter This has been a long time want for me and it was a big letdown. It was kind of a bitter mess. So dry, it was almost as if it were aged in cab franc barrels instead of bourbon. Barely any raw coconut with minimal sweetness. I seem to be the odd one out here. Maybe it was a bad bottle because I know the height of quality these guys usually reach with their barrel aged beers."
108,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.84,"Sweet and tart apricot, and mildly funky and acidic saison aromatics on this bad boy! Taste follows exactly with a beautiful, tart apricot swallow! There is some hints of a oakey wine notes hidden in there. This is so well-balanced and feels great on the palate! Outstanding!"
109,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.04,"This is one of those ""must try,"" beers to my knowledge, so I figured its worth reviewing.  Look: Pretty standard, but certainly hazier than I was expecting. Good lacing though.  Smell: This is where it starts to lose me a little. Now it smells fine and all, but for a Pale Ale, it's simply way too hoppy. I almost thought I had gotten the style wrong when I smelled it.  Taste: Again, this is not a Pale Ale. It's clearly an IPA with the level of hops going on here. There is almost no focus on bringing the malts up front, which is really what distinguishes the two styles for me. PAs can be hoppy, even very hoppy, but they need to also give attention to the forward malt flavor. This beer only has a semblance of that. I guess it's more present than a typical IPA, but hardly so, and I would bet any beer drinker would label it an IPA if you gave it to them blind. The taste isn't even bad, but to be honest it's a pretty standard fruity west coast style. Nothing special either; hops aren't particularly unique or interesting. As it starts to warm a bit the malt comes in, but right out of the can it's almost completely absent. Feel: I find it has a bit more success here. It isn't quite as heavy as a typical IPA, likely thanks to the slightly lower ABV. On the other hand, it's still far too heavy for a PA.  Overall: I like this beer. However, it simply doesn't work as a Pale Ale for me. There are plenty of hoppy PA's I've had that find that still manage to keep the malt characteristic of a PA; this is not one of them. Again, it's too heavy as well. Either this beer should be labeled an IPA, or brought down to something like 5.5% and given more malt focus. I don't know why some breweries have these baffling mislabeled beers sometimes, it puts a huge stain on what would otherwise be a fine beer. The fact that this has the #1 spot for Pale Ales shows how biased some of the reviewers on this site are towards IPAs. It feels like it has that spot because it's an IPA competing with Pale Ales, almost like an 8th grader competing in the little leagues.  Regardless, even if this *were* just called an IPA, I still don't think it would be the 40th best beer in the world which is what this site seems to contend. Not sure where the obsession with this beer came from, maybe it's something before my time. Also, a 6 pack of this is like 14 bucks when there are plenty of $11 six packs I'd say are way better."
110,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.31,Tasted from bottle batch 7. Pours a slight cloudy gold with no head. Lot of oak notes along with wine notes. A little bit of sour funk. Taste refreshing mildly sour funky refreshing beer. Some grassy notes along with grapes and maybe a little peach. Very well done.
111,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.57,"I received this from @jhavs. Canned on 10/22/2018. Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It has a classic NEIPA appearance: turbid, muddy-golden in color with a large foamy bright white cap and abundant, thick, lacing. The nose features lemon, tangerine, grapefruit, peach, a whiff of vanilla, and light floral hops. Wow, is this delicious! It opens rather tart with lots of lemon and grapefruit notes, balanced by sweet tangerine and other hints of tropical fruit. At the finish of the sip there is a subtle but noticeable appearance of vanilla that becomes more apparent as the glass warms and gives it a creamsicle quality. The bill of Citra and Galaxy hops is very flavorful and only slightly bitter. It finishes with a touch of pepper. The mouth feel is superb: rich and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation, and the 8% ABV provides lots of substance. Overall, I'm believing the hype. S&S #4 is sensational!"
112,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,5.0,"Absolutely the best stout that I have ever had; bar none. You can taste and feel the alcohol content. It is not overwhelming, but smooth instead. Will buy again!"
113,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.4,"Pours very dark with appropriate mocha head. Fantastic aromas of chocolate and coffee. Pretty sweet, very good chocolate and coffee flavors, very flavorful, slight yeasty finish. Rich and creamy. Overall a very good BA Imperial Stout. Aged very well. 6/7/20"
114,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.65,"B1 Starbright, mid-high clarity, champagne effervescence, appropriate head and retention per style, straw-green hue; errupting notes of underipe apricot and peach, lemon zest, lemon juice, flesh, damp slate, damp grass, damp barnyard bedding; under and over ripe peach, apricot, peach pit sweat, lemon rind and juice; pleasant and thin feel with appropriate effervescence, residual and cloying acid and sugars;  B2 Bright, straw, moderate haze, great head and retention per style;"
115,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.96,"Can from Jeff, thanks again!"
116,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.69,"2007 bottle, generously shared by Sean9869, thanks for letting me try a super long time want. The beer pours a dark cola brown, nearly black color with swirls of brown, caramel and hazelnut before it all melds together with a slight head that recedes quickly and leaves spots of lace. The aroma is wonderful, wood, char, light chocolate, slightly roasted coffee and toasted grain, sweet alcohol, pitted stone fruit, toffee, molasses, every time I took a sniff, I felt like there was something new, exceedingly complex. The beer really shined on the tongue, bakers chocolate, stone fruit, coffee, barrel character, toffee, mollasses, marshmallow, alcohol and then some, just like the nose, each sip brought out something new and something exciting. The balance is spectacular, the complexity is unending, and the smoothness is hardly matched. The body was great, coats the mouth well, super smooth, rich, decadent without being taxing or too thick. Verdict: Magnificent, easily the most complex and rewarding RIS I've tried to date and the wood only complimented this further. One of the few beers that has really lived up to the crazy hype, and even exceeded it. Well done Närke."
117,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.09,"2/6/21 Clear amber, nice dense white head, recedes slowly to a very lacy cap. I without thinking took a sip before I even opened BA. It knocked my sox off it tasted so good; smells just slightly like an IPA, faintly hoppy; Ooh, the taste. It's unusual, and very pleasant; The mouthfeel is just right, perfect. It feels like beer. After two sips, this may be my new favorite beer. Well, later sips were a little less spectacular. We'll have to see if it becomes a favorite. I expect there may be more of it, but at $21.49 a six, probably not all that often. 2/9/21 The taste is full, robust, and it is somewhat bitter with a hint of sour. The taste of this second one didn't measure up to the first. But no adjustment to the score."
118,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.15,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a large, creamy head. Smell is quite sweet and dominated by maple syrup, with hints of lightly roasted, caramel malt and chocolate, coffee and bourbon notes. Taste follows the nose, being quite sweet and absolutely dominated by maple syrup and caramel, lightly roasted malt, with lighter notes of coffee, chocolateand lovely vanilla bourbon notes, as well as a certain earthy, woody oak presence. Finishes bittersweet, with a light bitterness and an almost cloying maple sweetness lingering in the aftertaste. Thick mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation. While this is a really nice stout, it's still highly overrated in my personal opinion, due to a poor balance that heavily favors an intense maple sweetness that almost drowns out most of the other flavors, while there really isn't that much coffee to it either. Its one saving grace are some lovely bourbon and oak notes that both complement the flavor profile while at the same time adding some much needed depth. I'm certainly not getting any ""salty bacon"" from this either. Certainly enjoyable, but far from world-class in my personal opinion, although this may also be due to the bottle being already 18 months old when I had it. I could imagine the coffee being more intense and creating a better balance against the maple when this is fresh."
119,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.97,"Pours a rich chocolate black color that is impervious to light. 2 inch tan head quickly fades to a light brown ring around the glass. Cinnamon dominates the nose, followed swiftly by Maple and coffee. Cinnamon and maple also dominate upon first sip, coffee moves in afterward and smoothes out the finish. This is definitely a full-bodied beer, carbonation is minimal and perfect. Overall a delicious and flavorful beer, none of the flavors overwhelmed or dominate, they are perfectly mingled together.  10/12/17"
120,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.49,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter.  Pours an ink black body with very little head and retention. Aromas are heavy on the whiskey and milk chocolate, very strong and potent Classic BA stout aromas. A little booze. On the tongue is a rich balance of vanilla, coffee, dark fruits, milk chocolate, finishing with bittersweet chocolate and cocoa, roasty. Medium heavy body with very low carbonation. Very enjoyable, easy to drink and flavorful."
121,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,3.94,"Great oatmeal stout full of rich flavors. Strong on the nose, but overall a solid beer. I am surprised this is ranked as #1 as far as oatmeal stouts are concerned, but still a great beer!"
122,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.15,"10/2016 - Massive Mosaic presence on the nose, with earthiness popping front and center, plus some honey; body is a bit creamier, nice honey notes too; intense hop bite at the end."
123,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.67,"L - motor oil. Dark as black, but with a brownish hue. Minimal head, but the ring of lacing that's left is crimson tan in color. S - burst of milk chocolate up front that quickly turns acrid as the milk turns dark and we're left with raw cocoa beans. There's a sweet maple/honey blanket over the whole thing and even some peanut butter richness. By far the most aromatically diverse of the KBS variants. T - such richness. Wow. Undulating between sweet milk chocolate and roasty bourbon woodsiness. On one side of the coin is vanilla extract, maple candy, and dark cherry fruitiness . On the other is fudgy tanginess and that core KBS barrel acidity. Fantastic contrast. F - unfortunately thin for this ABV, but still does the trick in delivering a massive dose of chocolatey flavor, so it's pretty hard to complain. O - KBS jacked up with a heaping helping of decadent sweetness. Hits all the right notes from OG KBS and introduces a bold, but carefully crafted adjunct flavor."
124,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.77,"A porter called “ Last Snow” from a Florida brewery (Funky Buddha) had to be interesting, but I never expected it to be exceptional. Revealing beautiful flashes of ruby and garnet when held up to a backlight, and a bouquet that is redolent of coffee, chocolate and coconut, it’s no surprise that one person declared it to be like a “liquefied Mounds Bar.” And that analogy remains relevant on the palate. A smooth mouthfeel and a sweetish finish produce a wonderfully crafted beer. Some have criticized the sweetness level, but I didn’t find it to be excessive. It’s a truly great dessert beer and one that’s on a par with another favorite of mine called Samoa This. And as it warms, it gets even more flavorful, making it a great choice for any Snow Birds in the Northeast who want to sip it in front of a roaring fire. That said, Last Snow is definitely not a session beer. One and done at one sitting would be my recommendation. But if you’re a fan of those flavors, you’d be wise to keep a sixer on hand...especially if you run out out Mounds bars."
125,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.31,"Pours really dark brown with small mocha head. Very strong coffee on the nose. Good coffee notes on the palate, and the alcohol is well hidden. Slightly sweeter, but I didn't get the thick mouth feel that others claim. Didn't really pickup on the vanilla. Overall a well made beer, but a little overpraised in my opinion."
126,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.5,Poured from a 16 oz. can at home. Thanks for the trade Dan! The taste of this follows the aroma with a nice mixture of maple and coffee. Thick. Very enjoyable.
127,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.65,"Pours golden yellow with a small white head of about 1 finger. Has a lemony, citrus smell. Nice tart, lemony, smooth acidic flavor. Very nice on a hot day. Wonderful beer."
128,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.48,"I've been waiting a long time for a chance at Darkness. I finally picked up a bottle this summer in Durango Colorado, of all places. I suppose I could sit on it for a while, but it seemed like the perfect beer for a dark December night in rainy Seattle. It's dark, oh yeah. There's a good tan head, but it doesn't last long. The taste/smell are notable first for what's not there. There's no bourbon, no chocolate, no coconut, in fact there's no sweetness at all. In an era of tarted up over sweet stouts (hello, CBS), Darkness is refreshingly basic ... it's a very fine mix of roasted malts and hops. Now the roasted malts do have some dry cocoa flavor, but this is not like drinking a Hershey bar. I get dark fruits (raisins, sort of), but again it's not sweet. There's a hefty dose of hops that give the beer a kick. The 12% ABV is somehow hidden. I had the 2018 vintage. By the way, this does remind me of Old Rasputin."
129,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.62,"Hopslam is yet another classic Bell's top-of-the-line brews. The sweetness in this beer is reminiscent of a DIPA, but with the unique flavor of honey quickly usurped by the lingering hops. Worth a buy each year!"
130,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.18,"Poured into my tulip this beer is a cloudy golden amber with a tall creamy off white head. Great retention and tons of lace. Great looking beer. Scent is pine needles, pineapple, spice, grapefruit and floral. Some stone fruit - peach, nectarine. Soething in the scent reminds me of rosemary. Taste is surprisingly dry. Vinous white grape notes. There's a minor bitterness in the background. Green melon. Mint. Hints of orange. Light stone fruit.s Mouth is lightly creamy with a brief finish. Interesting profile and obviously well made but for my palate it doesn't hold up to the hype."
131,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.7,"Striking the difference between robust, decadent and drinkable lands the double barrel aged version of Evil Twin's imperial stout in no one's land, but also everyone's land. Double Barrel Jesus pours with an oily layering into the glass. Like syrups, a patient swirl releases a short statured but densely packed froth. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, coffee and sherry all align on the nose with a sultry sweet and savory scent. Rich with malts, the early palate accepts a lush taste of those promised chocolates, cake, caramel, cream and vanilla that sat in anticipation of flavor. As the stout opens up, its high sweetness only recedes slighlty. Chocolate fudge, espresso, heavy cream, vanilla, molasses and brown sugar register soundly on the middle palate. Moderately bitter, the internal woodsiness of the beer trends oaken, spicy and awaiting a boozy kick of sherry, bourbon and peaten scotch whisky. Decadent in taste and texture, the absolute fullness of the stout becomes marshmallowy, milkshake-like, and trailing with a long, savory and woodsy nuttiness."
132,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.03,"Slick motor oil black with a loud, dark mocha fizz that quickly dies off to nothing but a faint ring and never returns. Some oily specks decorate the surface thereafter. Smell is big, waxy, nutty bourbon and oak right up front, tickling with some heat. Unabashedly supporting are decadent notes of chocolate fudge and a touch of coconut that's not quite toasted, but comes across as though it's fresh and added to a vanilla creme frosting. Taste begins with sweet, creamy coconut frosting and dark, super sweet chocolate syrup working with nutty, peppery bourbon and splintery oak that builds in heat to a moderate degree. Feel is medium to full, a little slick, but also crisply carbonated, with a semi-dry finish. The tongue begins tingling from the heat after a while."
133,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,3.95,"Pours night black with a beautiful light brown colored head, which slowly fades to a coating layer of lacing atop the liquid. Smell is of spicy, toasty bourbon barrel, earthy coffee and a good amount of burned rock sugar atop. This has a silk, lighter mouthfeel mouthfeel, featuring a heavier, yet well balanced beer. Tastes of bakers chocolate, boozy pralines and warming, oaken bourbon among layers upon layers of milk chocolate and accompanying licorice. This gets enhanced by chocolaty, wooden coffee, which inherits a gently, well dosed sweet peak, adding to the rich malt foundation of the beer. Finishes with less roast, more whipped cream covered milk chocolate and a light dryness, resulting from burned malts and a more pronounced coffee presence.  Sweet, smooth and well balanced - this drinks almost too easy for what it is. The coffee in this does not stand out too much on its own, but rather enriches the beer in a pleasant way."
134,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.71,"Canned 5/13/21 Consumed 5/25/21 High expectations here and luckily they’re met. It looks beautiful, smells amazing, feels amazing, and has a unique (for me) flavor profile with a perfect balance of bitterness and juiciness. Some 6.8% beers could leave me wanting more oomph, but they hit the nail here. This is why hazies rule now. I’m glad I have 3 more cans and will look for it again."
135,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,3.53,L: pours thick brown with no head at all. No hiss when I opened the cap...still
136,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.48,"Pours two finger head from freshly canned 12oz vessel into wine glass. Very sweet and melon-tasting with a Cabot cheese smell. Good for the first half then became too sweet. Better from the can imo. Very good, but needs to be pretty cold to enjoy it without it becoming too sweet."
137,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.64,"I mean, damn near perfect. Pours a nice medium orange, good head and carbonation. The aroma wafts of tropical fruits and herbal hops. The flavor / taste is probably the most complex of all the Pale Ale’s I’ve tried: a panoply of tropical and citrus flavors, herbal, sneaky hoppy, perfect balance. I don’t know whether I like this or Zombie better because they are sorta different animals but god this is great, cheers!"
138,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.66,This is a world-class beer all the way around. The apricots and earthiness mingle well together and the slight hint of tartness are amazing...This is a 2011 edition and it is drinking incredibly right now. I have to admit that I never thought I would ever lay eyes on this but I'm glad I finally got a chance to try this. It is simply amazing. I love the way that the sweetness of the fruits and the tartness of the beer play against one another here. I am very fortunate to be able to have had a chance to give this one a go. If you ever run across this I would highly highly highly recommend it. It is simply incredible...
139,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.21,L: Light shade of darkness. Much more brown than black
140,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.39,"Pours an opaque brownish black color with quickly dissipating tan head and fair amount of residual lacing.Nose is very mild chocolate sweetness ,a bit of bourbon barrel and a touch of honey. Taste follows nose ,feels a bit on the thin side. Not quite a disappointment, but not the best value. Definitely a one and done, mainly due to cost.There are a whole lotta BA stouts out there for way less $$ that easily give this a run for the money.Don't get me wrong ,this is very,very good -just way over priced."
141,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.82,"A: Pours a hazy golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing S: Loads of citrus up front along with some tropical fruit and light floral notes T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of citrus and tropical fruit. Orange, grapefruit, and mango stand out. Light floral notes still present. Low bitterness. Very juicy. Finishes with lingering juicy citrus M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth O: A truly amazing brew. Extremely well balanced and drinkable, while still throwing the hops down like no other. A pure and true juice bomb NE IPA. A must-try"
142,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.82,"Reviewing both 2019 and the 2018 versions.  Purchased mostly for the bottle. Loved the label art. Beer poured a jet black, with minimal caramel head. Smelled rich, boozy, and like cocoa. Tasted like a rich, boozy RIS with dried fruit and licorice notes. Less cocoa in the flavor profile. Had a malty, silky mouthfeel. Drank at room temperature. Not sure if it would be worse ice cold, but really enjoyed it at ~65 degrees."
143,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.4,"12 oz, bottle purchased in OK. Poured into Kane chalice and allowed to warm. L: Small light tan head. Leaves no lacing but does have a persistent cap and ring. Beer is dark black.  S: Apples, brandy barrel, roasted malts, chocolate, floral and citrus hoppiness T: Well, this is something different. A big shot of apple brandy up front (as a NJeyan, I am very familiar with Laird's and this hits the mark) and that flavor persists throughout transitions to chocolate, roasted malts, and floral/citrus on the finish.  F: Not quite full-bodied, but in the neighborhood. Very lightly carbonated. Construction is so very well-done, as these are difficult flavors to merge. Balance is not quite there yet; it could use more aging to round things off. O: Very high degree of difficulty and it pulls it off pretty nicely."
144,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,5.0,"On tap at Whiskey Road in Cedar Falls, IA. Six-ounce pour, served in a small snifter. Deep, almost lightproof brownish-black in color, with a thin ring of tan foam. (The beer was apparently drawn to minimize the amount of foam, which for the price was okay by me.) Big and bold aromas and flavors of coffee, maple, toffee, chocolate, and molasses. No char. Lots of sweetness and alcohol warmth as expected, but incredibly smooth. Mouthfeel is delightfully thick and syrupy. The maple syrupy sweetness and notes of espresso linger on the finish. Does it live up to the hype? You betcha!"
145,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.57,"Can dated August 4 - beer share at Canton St, thanks Zack! Phenomenal. Tons of sweet mango but so perfectly balanced against a back drop of dank, chewy hops."
146,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.52,"22oz bottle poured into a snifter. Not sure the bottle date. Pours dark black with a light brown head that is about a finger high. Head slowly disappears leaving some nice lacing. Aromas of chocolate, maple, coffee, and what I can only assume is bacon. Really interesting nose. Tough to describe properly. Wow is this rich! Roasted malt, chocolate, salty bacon, maple syrup, and coffee notes. The description on the bottle mentions a smokey flavor and I'm picking that up also.  Medium body. A little on the thinner side compared to some stouts in this ABV range.  Overall a really intriguing and excellent beer! Was fun to review. The bacon makes your tastebuds do a double take after the first few sips. This thing is incredibly rich so be warned."
147,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,3.54,"Served on tap at Melzingah Tap House in Beacon, New York."
148,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.63,"On tap at Festival of Farmhouse Ales 2015. This was first time trying Flora (I had previously had the Blue/Black variant). While this doesn't quite reach the heights of Ann and Art, it is a tremendous barrel-aged saison. Wonderfully tart with a deep and complex flavor profile."
149,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.4,"Appearance - The beer poured a dark murky brown color. Bubbles clung to the sides of the glass.  Smell - I was made to think of Swedish fish, except a boozy version.  Taste - My initial impression was very bourbon forward. With the Swedish fish that I detected in the nose, there were notes of sweet caramel, amaretto, and leather. The finish produced warm notes with tge overall profile leaning more bitter.  Mouthfeel - There was a stickiness with the viscosity and even moderate carbonation.  Overall - I may have aged this too long, but it was quite nice."
150,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.6,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Yellow Session. Pitch black color. Aroma is essentially coffee with cream in beer form. Taste has sweet malt, bitter coffee, toffee and bourbon."
151,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.44,Canned on 9/17. Poured to Glass on 9/22.
152,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.36,"Burnt mahogany brown with a short mocha head that fizzles out audibly to a silky coffee black surface. First whiff is salted caramel, and first taste is Heath bar--both associations coming across as instantly recognizable. Sweet but delectable, it's got a sherry like oak that brings with it that signature nougat character. Charred barrel emerges more and more as it warms, also with more heat, yet never too much.  The medium body is fine yet lightly syrupy sticky, but its firmly dense carbonation comes into a nicely woody dry, gullet warming finish. While it seems like it might be a bit sweeter than I remember batch 2 in 2014 being, there's not one single off-note. --- I'm not sure why or when these entries were merged, since the vintages went through different treatments, but the above review was for the upside down, black waxed pint can. In July 2021, I finally got my hands on a 2017 red waxed 12 ounce bottle, and found it to be fully deserving of all its laurels. The oak is actually still really assertive. The overall expression is peppery whiskey, mature port and cocoa-dusted date all enveloped by an excellent char that's far more forward and bold than I'd expected, without being overbearing or unpleasant. It's a dichotomy that doesn't often occur, or even make sense, as the body here wasn't particularly thick or dampening, and such a bold barrel presence can often become too spicy, boozy, burnt or woody. However, here on exhibit is a magical convergence of fortunes. I can see how this rocketed Anchorage to its lofty hype status, but I'm not sure they've ever quite achieved such heights again. Such are the perils of transcendence. As such, I'm not going to increase my score, opting instead to keep the more recent, but still excellent, vintage as precedent."
153,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.24,"I find this beer to be like John Mayer. Is your body a wonderland? I dunno. Great aroma, great taste, but the body... yeah, a work in progress like your little brother that is in his 4th year of undergrads. I think I’m lifted."
154,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,5.0,"The best iteration of the Haze family. Incredible color, smell, taste. The classic treehouse mouth feel is on full display here. A triumph of a DIPA. Delicious peach and citrus notes, low bitterness, a joy to drink."
155,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.09,"A 1 pint can, with strangely no visible canned on date (looks like it got cut off the side of the can). Can was also quite severely deformed on the top (my fault), which made it extremely hard to open, although I somehow managed it in the end. Doesn’t appear to have affected the beer with no leaks. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass. Appearance: A hazy dark orange colour with a half finger white head that dissipated quickly and left only sparse lacing. Aroma: Orange, mango and pineapple with a hint of grass, caramel malt and booze. Taste: Grapefruit and citrus rind light bitterness, with some pineapple, honey and malt sweetness. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall: This was nice, but sweeter and maltier than expected, and just didn’t feel as balanced as the Galaxy version."
156,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.74,"Pours gold - a slight bit of haze with a puffy 3 finger head that leaves big rings of lace. Aromas of earthy brett, lemon, white grape, hay and oak - very complex. Taste is spot on - light Oaked malts balanced with a hint of dry white grape, green apple, lemongrass, white pepper and very slight bitterness and sourness - VERY easy to drink."
157,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,5.0,"Does anyone taste Lipton Ring-O noodle soup at the end? It's more apparent from the can. It tastes really good not so much in spite of that aftertaste, but because of it."
158,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.62,"This has a wonderful bursting lemon mixed with pith that makes this complex, sophisticated and easy drinking. A major upgrade from regular Dorothy. Great offering, almost in the realm of Art, Ann and Le Sarrasin."
159,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.05,"Pouring this from a 16 oz. can into a tulip glass, this beer pours out absolutely beautiful. It’s pitch black and forms a two finger, creamy, thick, dark mocha colored crown. The crown holds well and leaves lacing. It would be hard for this to look much better.  The nose brings roasty, dark malts more so than roasty coffee. However, there is a coffee presence. It also brings a bitterness to it that resembles bitter bakers chocolate; dark chocolate. A smooth cream note wants to show, but hardly does. Almost an earthy, peat like note? The taste brings in a cream presence along with those roasty, slightly burnt malts. Bitter, dark chocolate still showing. A black pepper like spice shows up at the end, along with a little bit of an earthy wood/smoke presence.  The mouthfeel is creamy underneath that black pepper and light earthy smoke presence. Hardly any sign of the 12% ABV, which is impressive. It does show a bitterness all the way through. I would say the body is on the light side of full bodied, thick and creamy but not fudge like.  Overall, while this wasn’t bad, I’ve got to admit I did expect more from it."
160,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.22,Pours a fairly clear dark red color with a thin foamy head that quickly dissipates. Very little to no lacing. Aroma of sour dark fruits and red wine. Tart and smooth taste. Red wine and dark fruits. Very good.
161,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.35,Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Sour apricot aromas. Big sour apricot notes dominate. Super sour but still damn tasty. Good body and mouthfeel.
162,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.2,"Opaque peach-orange with a thin white ring. Smell is seedy passion fruit with spicy tangerine, peach, apricot, and herbal juniper. Taste is really smooth yet tangy guava+passion fruit+mango that combines into a deliciously unique and tart peach-tangerine character, finishing semi-wet. Very good, super tasty, but does it live up to the absolutely overwhelming hype? No, but considering the staggering explosion of awareness this has gotten recently, nothing ever could. It is very good, but it does not justify a stampede of heathens looking to tear down civil society. That being said, I think I liked Absolute Devotion better than this."
163,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.6,"Wow, total mango quava delight. Barely any head or retention, but beautiful color(s) and fruity as can be on the nose and palate. I poured in three separate phases to enjoy the spectrum, clean first pour, clean with dreads second pour, and dread only third pour. Got to say I liked them all. Met the hype, and worth the hunt!"
164,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.66,"Kuhnhenn - man, I really had no idea. What is going on up there in Michigan? So many fantastic breweries! Fourth Dementia pours a deep, oily brown-black - it looks incredibly viscous and syrupy, while the smell is all warm, malty sweetness. I gave this some time to reach room temperature. On a first taste, the sweetness really took me by surprise. It's incredibly rich and cloying, almost syrupy - excellent texture, with a delicious toffee caramel marshmallow taste to it. Again, very, very sweet - but it's so smooth, and disguises the ABV so well, that the sweetness doesn't bother. Also slightly surprising - I'm accustomed to some sort of unpleasant aftertaste with a beer that is so incredibly sweet... but 4th D is exceptionally clean. This is a fantastic beer. I'm generally one to avoid old ales - but this particular bottle was part of an LIF from FlintB, so I couldn't say no! Tremendously delicious bottle - thanks again, FlintB!"
165,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.96,"12 oz bottle, born on 11/9/2020, poured into a snifter at 55 degrees F:"
166,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.61,"From a 16oz can, dated 11/11/20. Served in a Foam-branded cervoise for no good reason. Pours a bright and cheery, fresh-squeezed sunshiney-orange with two fingers of whipped, lathery suds. Retention is just shy of excellent, leaving a creamy, sudsy cap and collar and a thick, gobby blanket of lacing. Looks as close to a 5 as anything I’ve ever seen, so... Powerfully aromatic aroma of tropical fruit basket. Pineapple, sweet orange, papaya and lemon.  Taste is pretty much exactly what the look and smell were leading me to expect, just with a little background citric bitterness. Ripe pineapple and orange slices with whipped cream, papaya, lemonade and grapefruit juice.  Feel is creamy, soft and doughy. Medium-hefty bodied but with ample, near-aggressive levels of prickly carbonation brightening and lightening things. Sweet merciful Dionysius, this is total human catnip. Just lay me down in a trough of this stuff and leave me to flop around until the breath has left my body."
167,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.76,"750ml bottle poured into a teku A- pours deep brown in color with a one finger creamy khaki head that reduces to a ring S- caramel and toffee, leather, pipe tobacco, chocolate brownie batter, walnuts, brown sugar, rich oak and bourbon  T- rich caramel and toffee up front are followed by earthy notes of pipe tobacco, booze soaked raisins, digs and dates. The finish brings out bold barrel notes, adding more caramel, vanilla, coconut, rich oak and barrel juice. The finish gives more caramel and toffee, along with oak M- heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety finish"
168,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.71,"Let’s have maple syrup, coffee, bacon and bourbon for breakfast in the middle of the night. It’s the life of the craft beer affecianado. Big thanks to @Roguer for knocking down this long time want. Hits all the notes and then some. Delicious brew and I’ll have to strum up another to share after bogarting this one all to myself."
169,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.67,"2018 sucaba, tasted on 2021.1.9"
170,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.9,"2014 vintage, poured into a decanter, at the Lambik-o-droom.  Semi-hazy amber pour with a thin, velvety off-white head.  Easily identifiable 3 Fonteinen lambic funk, green apples, mineral notes, light fruit oxidation, a bit of grapefruit, sherry (or I should say Oloroso), very light caramel, oak, light vanilla. Very interesting to have side-by-side with Oloroso and PX. Compared to batch 2 - Solera, this one is drier, much more funk-forward and a bit more oaky, as well. Very similar to the Armand & Gaston.  Absolutely delicious, I think I prefer this just a bit more to the second batch, though it migh just be because of its age. --- Batch 2 - Solera Sampled at BXL Beer Fest and again at 3 Fonteinen Open Brewery Days.  Semi-hazy orange pour straight from the bottle, and clear orange at the brewery, from the decanter. A thin white head.  Notes of cognac, honey, lambic funk, grapes, white wine, whiskey, oak, light vanilla. Really complex lambic and sherry aroma, and close to perfect dusty, musty 3F funk. I feel like I need to drink a whole bottle by myself before I understand this beer. Smooth texture, medium carbonation, bitter-sweet and light sour finish."
171,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,3.92,"Lawson's Sunshine is a staple here in New England, and my go-to IPA if I'm in the mood for something strong. That's why I was surprised to see a Double IPA version. It ups the ABV by about half a percentage point, but takes some of that brighter, happier notes and brings it down a few notes to be sweeter and a little stickier. It's strong, but still well balanced and intense. This is a good ""last beer of the night"" and only with a DD, but the strength delivers some tasty hop notes without being burly or clumsy."
172,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.44,"Bottled 8/26/15; drank 8/13/16 @ Golgi Apparatus.  Opaque orange appearance.  Small bright white head; minimal lace.  Apricot, mango & pineapple notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Apricot & mango flavors up front; tangy peach notes on the finish.  Mildly tart; a delicious, boldly fruity treat. Excellent!"
173,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.5,"Shared from a 750mL, thanks Tom for sharing this.  Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a small brown head that reduces to nothing.  Aromas are boozy but inviting, cocoa and dark chocolate, dark fruits, chocolate liquor. Taste is rich, so much flavor here with fudge, rich chocolate cake, chocolate liquor, boozy dark fruits, finishing lightly bitter. Mouthfeel is rich and thick, low carbonation."
174,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.26,"A: An oily, black pour with brown highlights: length, retention, and lacing are minimal S: Aroma is well involved with traces of bourbon coinciding to arrays of vanilla fudge, caramel brownies, cocoa, oak, and tones of smoked molasses with faint, whiskey-soaked dark fruit coming on delicately T: Vanilla surmises the palate in exquisite fashion accompanied by milk chocolate mounds, marshmallows, roasted caramelized-nuts, oak, and coffee infused creamer with traces of fruit, and hints of smoked bark M: Granted syrupy, rich, and creamy yet mitigated and not cloying sweet. Thus, a moderated thick feel, with apt carbonation and medium heat O: The barrel plays extremely well with the notes: the whiskey element works immensely – A sensible, and measured effort from the Mikkeller team"
175,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.2,"Had a pour at Dark Lord day and it was pretty good. Not long before I had BA abraxis and BA darkness, both were better. To me this beer should not be ranked this high"
176,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.03,"16oz can from Halftime. Hazy golden pour, small silky head. Aroma brings citrusy hops, pure and simple. Taste is more hops, lemony, citrus, that leaves your palate tingling. Slightly dry, sweet, plenty bitter."
177,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.65,Look - fantastic hazy thick slightly dark yellow with a great white head and sticky lacing
178,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.61,Pours a hazy golden orange with two fingers of tightly formed white head. The head fell faster than I expected.
179,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.5,"Pours very dark, pretty viscous, decent mocha head that slowly fades. Huge peanut butter aroma mixes with minimal chocolate. Very nice peanut flavor, light chocolate, espresso rounds off the finish with a light bitterness. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a very tasty imperial pastry stout, love the low 7.6 ABV.  5/9/21"
180,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.26,A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a collar of dark tan bubbles around the edge of the glass and some wisps of lacing on the surface.
181,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.4,"Pours a turbid orange with a cream head that lingers for 5+ minutes  Nose is tropical fruit, vanilla, some citrus and pine cone through at the end.  Taste follows with big tropical fruit, vanilla, a little bitterness lingers with some sweetness  Feel is traditional other half - medium mouth feel with minimal carb  Overall - big tropical fruit(mango, guava, and passion fruit) forward hazy IPA. This drinks very easy and could have a couple. Do wish it was slightly lighter on the pallet"
182,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.43,"Their own description of “ dry, refreshing and hoppy. We really focused on hop flavor” is perfect. It’s all and only those things. Very bright. Quite carbonated off the tap. Slight, thin head. Tasty and refreshing with enough hop bitterness on the finish to keep you from drinking it too fast. Nicely balanced. Not that I’m telling you anything you don’t already know!"
183,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,3.6,"Sparkling gold, off-white collar. Holy funk! It's a challenging, confusing nose--I'm getting a patch of weeds, acetic olive brine, sherry vinegar, and cedar. Taste is oak and tannin funk, white grape skin, grapefruit rind, brine, and black peppercorn. Pungent hoppiness seems to develop as it warms, and maybe a little kerosene. Medium body, semi-dry finish."
184,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.45,"Finally got to rate this beer. B3 from bottle to glass, pours an opaque orange hue, a lot like the juice. Very fruity on the nose. The flavor profile to me is very similar to Fuzzy(I guess I should have an actual peach and apricot side by side to really know the difference), which in the end is why I am rating it the same. Beautiful beer, that I think Side Project has improved over previous batches, as the acidity levels have gone down quite significantly in my opinion."
185,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.5,"Blend 2 - drank October 25th, 2019. Quite sour, a bit funky, slightly musty with very nice grape notes. Really excellent. This reminds me quite a bit of Jester King sours. Thank you, Buck89!"
186,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.61,"From a 16 oz. can poured a beautiful hazy peachy gold with a 3 finger white frothy head that dissipated slowly leaving heavy lacing. Nose is mango, pineapple and citrus. Taste follows the nose but leading off with malt and finishing with a very nicely balanced hop bitterness. Moderate body and carbonation with a refreshing feel. I have to say . . . I am surprised at how much I like this beer. This is sooo very easy to drink."
187,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.53,"Extraordinarily rich and flavorful stout. Smell and taste of stewed, sweetened dark berries. Intense dark chocolate. Subtle licorice and dark coffee. Bourbon whiskey background that is more pronounced as it warms - boozy. Excellent head and lacing atop a rich dark brown. Glad to have found it on tap."
188,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.03,"12oz. can served in a tulip. Pours a bright, hazy orange with a loose, 1/8th inch, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a frothy slick. Nose suggests cannabis of the can pop. In the glass, aromas of dank, earthy notes, citrus and pith. Taste follows nose earthy/herbal qualities overshadow the citrus. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (cloudier to light) with a carbonation shy of bright and a mild acidity. Overall, an interesting variation on the style - juicy, but not overpoweringly so and not the highlight of this beer."
189,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.31,Bottled 10/27/17
190,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.64,"Split with JLindros. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave light wisps. Really nice legs. S - Big aromas of chocolate galore, real nice coconut, roasted coconut meat and flakes, nice bourbon juice as well, light barrels. T - Taste is similar to the nose with huge bourbon notes, rich barrel as well, nice oak. Great coconut, almost chunky, the chocolate is nice. M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, rather oily, not that creamy either. O - Overall this was a very solid stout with a nice bourbon notes. The coconut was nice, however, rather chunky in the glass. Serving Type: bottle"
191,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.52,"I LOVE this breweries Imperial Stouts and when I find them I am never disappointed. This is no exception. Smooth, almost no head when I poured it. Tasty and I hope they have some left when I go back to the Total Wine here in Fl."
192,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.38,Giving this one the benefit of the doubt because the bottle was slightly old. But overall still the usual murky fantasticness I've come to expect from Trillium.
193,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.73,"Batch #3, drank on 7/6/2019. Quite sour, excellent plum. Beautiful, thick pour. Batch #4, drank on 7/14/2019. Dry and excellent plum flesh. Zero funk. Tart. Super good. A bit more transparent than batch #3."
194,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.49,"This is an excellent beer. Pillowy, fluffy, wonderful citrus small and taste.  Poured from a can dated 2/2/21 into a tulip glass. Light cloudy yellow color with with fluffy white head and good curtain lacing. Right amount of bitterness at the finish. I would have given 4.75 for taste if just a hint sweeter.  Picked this up while in Ohio. I hope Toppling Goliath distributes to Texas soon!"
195,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.04,"Pours like syrup--smooth and sweet. Very dark brown with a mocha head. It is rich with strong milk chocolate flavor, and subtle coffee flavor underneath. Several good aspects to this stout, but perhaps a bit too sweet, making this lean toward dessert beer."
196,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.44,"2016 vintage. 750 mL bottle poured into snifter. Black, thin tan head  Bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, and coffee in the nose. Excellent balance between barrel, coffee, and base stout. Taste follows the nose with bourbon up front along with dark chocolate and coffee, hint of dark fruit. Very balanced  Full-bodied, perhaps just a touch overcarbonated for my taste"
197,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.73,Abraxas has always been one of my favorite stouts without a doubt. I’m excited to have some ‘19 coffee on draft at Beer Temple Chicago. The thing that makes this special is the balance between all the adjuncts and incredible full mouthfeel and body. This is worth the hype and would only ask for a barrel aged version for something potentially better?
198,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.53,"On tap at other half Rochester , tasting glass  Hazy orange , white Guam ring, some lacings Aroma is passion fruit  Taste is tangerine citrus  Very smooth, almost creamy  Good beer"
199,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.32,"Opaque chestnut brown with a moderate fuzzy tan blanket that slowly settles to the thinnest ring and a smooth slick surface. A tilt leaves an impressive span of clear legs on the glass. The aroma has swirls of vanilla and caramel, even as the glass sits further away. Coming in close, charred oak and aged date pair with toffee and a distinctly maple-esque bourbon warmth. Taste is just as sweet and decadent as the nose sounds. Belly warming caramel frosting is lifted by Jack and Coke--it sounds odd and maybe off-putting, but it's light on the palate, helping its drinkability. Heavier notes of dark fruit and vanilla marshmallow fluff are again countered by sweet, light and even floral fig, which all begins to transform into fresh coconut on the exhale, especially as it warms. Tingly and even crisp, the medium body is really easy to drink for a big burly barleywine. It's even inexplicably fleeting, disappearing into a slightly numbing, lightly sticky, semi-dry finish, leaving you desperately craving another swig. Obviously, I like this a lot, but at the same time, feel like I can't quite grasp it. There's something unsatisfying that leaves you wanting, and maybe that's the beauty of it."
200,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.6,Pours dark black with a small tan head. Smells of dark roasted coffee predominate. Tastes of bitter coffee up front followed by a almost sweet cherry from the barrels. Excellent
201,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.64,"Beer #4000 deserves something special. Huge thanks to DocJ007 yet again for the crazy beer he shares with us all. 375ml bottle from 2012. Pours deep reddish purple with a one and a half finger tall white head, slowly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small webs of lace on the sides of the glass. Smells of sweet/tart fresh picked blueberries, the ever present Cantillon musty brewery funk, some mild lactic sourness, yogurt and finally some grains. Taste follows the same path with plenty of tart blueberries and lactic sourness up front followed closely by the must and finally the lightly chewy grains. Feel is slightly grainy quickly being enveloped by plenty of musty sourness and slight sweetness from the berries. Overall an excellent fruit lambic. I still prefer a few of there others more but I would never turn down another chance to try this one. Glad to finally get to try it, thanks again Justin!"
202,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.58,"Poured from a mini bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. Love the artwork L: Clear deep red/burgundy pour with 2 fingers of foamy fink head. Great retention and leaves a thick rim of sticky lacing. Looks like red wine with head. S: Tart and fruity.. raspberry, summer fruit, and funk. T/F: Tart raspberry and fruit up front. At least a mild pucker but not unpleasant. Funk and a hint of fruity/berry sweetness that is quickly squashed with a dry sour prickle. One you can feel in your salivary glands a bit. Light and crisp... well carbonated. A bit astringent. O: Outstanding fruity sour... top of the heap and definitely one to grab if you have the opportunity. Wish I had a few more bottles!"
203,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.68,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with beige head. Tasted against regular 16 Huna and 17 Bourbon BA Huna. Aroma of cinnamon, rum, almost a little nutty, some fruity notes and apple. Moderate to heavily sweet with mild bitterness. Lots of cinnamon, caramel, toffee, some chocolate and finishes with a moderate chili burn. You do get some rum barrel sweetness and just a hint of brandy. More intense and complex than the Huna and Bourbon Huna. Excellent!"
204,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,3.83,Extremely bitter/vegetal...at least on this batch. Tried several cans at various points of the August 2019 batch and they were all unpleasant. A rare miss for HF.
205,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.94,"Absolutely incredible. Dark, nearly completely opaque brown. So sweet and sticky that somehow my fingers ended up sticky. Cognac shines. Somehow this is 17%. Only tastes...13%? God, the only complaint I have about this beer is that I don't know if I'll ever get another taste of it. Better to have loved and lost..."
206,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.31,"Appearance - The beer was a murky black color with a mocha colored head.  Smell - The nose was super sweet with notes of bourbon and maple.  Taste - At the front, my first impression was that I was drinking super sweet coffee. The maple notes largely overpowered the coffee. The stickiness of the maple hid the bourbon notes and any sense of alcohol.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation was faint. In conjunction with the maple, the beer was sticky.  Overall - There was a bit too much sweetness for me to reall enjoy this beer."
207,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.71,One of my favorite side project beers. Still had that typical Side Project lacto but the fruit comes through in this one much more than a lot of their other beers.
208,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.24,"Almost a typical NEIPA look but nit as murky. Aroma is delicious citrus, maybe a touch of juniper or pine, some dough. Juicy flavor, not harsh at all, drinkability is scary. My takeaway from Hill Farmstead IPA's after not having them for three years is that they are more refined and subtle than some of the stuff from Treehouse or Trillium. They capture all the right notes but they are soft and refined. I didn't think I liked Galaxy hops but this is high quality beer."
209,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,3.88,"A 12.7 fl. oz. bottle, 2017 vintage, poured into a snifter glass. Appearance: Black in colour with a thin mocha brown head that dissipated quickly and left only some sparse spotty lacing. Aroma: Roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, bourbon, booze, molasses, licorice, with a hint of herbal and char. Taste: Roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa, herbal, molasses, licorice, bourbon, caramel, brown sugar with only a hint of dark fruit, char and maple syrup. Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall: Nice to drink but the maple just seemed to be overpowered by the bourbon, molasses and licorice."
210,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.41,Black and dark in color. So much jam. Jammy goodness. Sour and tart and goodness. Black berries and raspberries. Very drinkable. I'd love to have more of this one.
211,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.31,"Assumed fresh can poured into Lagunitas mason jar. Pours a muddled, hazy orange peach with 1 finger of orange tinted, off white head. Minimal lacing. The nose is citrus, orange, grassiness and some pine. Soft, tropical fruits, mango, pine and resin in the finish. Somewhat of a malty finish too. Mouthfeel is spot on and very drinkable. Another win, can they make a bad beer?"
212,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.62,"2014 bottle, pours near still, no head, some tiny bubbling. Aroma is raspberry, funk. Taste:. Heavy on the raspberry, funky, lactic sourness, yogurt. Lighter body, faintest hint of carbonation. And I still loved it."
213,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.77,"What a great surprise to get to try this at Toronado during Duck Days of Summer. 2016 Vintage. Poured into a goblet, it is a beautiful golden/orange color with a slight haze, and 1 finger of head. Smells was most stone fruit, peaches, apricots, a bit of lemon. Big creamy body with the right amount of dryness, acidity (mild), and tart & funk. I know they price point turns some folks off, but I considered this a treat and a beer I'd probably never have again so $60 seemed well worth it to me. If I do get another chance to drink this again, I won't hesitate."
214,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,3.78,I really don't get the hype behind this beer. This is big and sweet with a small tan head (even after the hard pour) into my gold TH teku. 
215,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.8,"Dark orange body, thick but slightly translucent, with a short white head and extravagant tiny bubble lacing. Nose is orange juice, slightly funky, with mango and other tropical notes in the background. Stronger tropical flavors, pineapple and passion fruit with the mango and citrus, and a close that is mild and clean. What a strong showing. This beer is so tightly dialed in, it is remarkable. Truly a great one."
216,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.7,"I've had the pleasure of enjoying Chemtrailmix three years in a row now - the bourbon barrel variant in 2017 stands out to me the most as it doesn't have the same bite and spice of rye (which I also happen to love). With a bit of age, the peppercorns mellow just slightly and the bourbon smoothly shines through. Back to back with barrel-aged Abraxas, this is still a tough one to beat. The cinnamon is far less present though, and those peppercorns have more of a bite. Even more so in the rye variants. Chemtrailmix is worth every bit of the praise and hype that it receives. It's a bit of an adjunct overload when fresh and hot, but it's a stunner with a little age. My love for this beer cannot be overstated."
217,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,5.0,My first De Garde taste. WOW! best brew i think i ever had.
218,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.0,"Can: Poured a hazy amber color ale with a large white head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh hoppy undertones with some dry hops notes and some fruity hops notes is enjoyable. Taste is a mix of floral undertones with some dry hops notes, some light fruity ester and some light vinous notes. Body is pretty full with good carbonation. Really enjoyable but I actually had more expectation. I wonder if the single version isn’t better."
219,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.1,"04/2016 - JWB's sours are a bit too acidic and borderline harsh for me - I think it's the guava - and this was no exception; but I do appreciate all the fruit, namely the passionfruit and mango that pops abound."
220,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,3.85,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKG05/18/21 14:44:54 BEST BY 09/15/21"" Appearance: The body of the beer is completely opaque and a pale beige-orange color. It has a short white head with loosely packed bubbles that fades out to a thin layer over the beer and a medium sloped ring at the edge of the glass. Aroma: The aroma really leaps out of the glass. It has notes of peach, tangerine, and a little bit of grapefruit. It smells nice but as the nose approaches the glass it doesn't get any stronger. Taste: Up front there is under-ripe pineapple, grapefruit, and a bit of lime. Towards the middle of the mouth there are more of the same flavors but some bitter lemon flavor comes through. It is a very bright and zesty tasting beer. The aftertaste has the flavor of a light dusting of confectioner's sugar. Mouthfeel: It feels on the upper edge of light-bodied with a somewhat crisp finish. There is a bitter bite to the beer akin to grapefruit pulp. It works for this beer. Overall: The flavor is really where this beer shines, having a bright and welcoming combination of citrus and tropical characters. This beer would pair nicely with something like grilled fish or a salad. It would be a great beer for a picnic or at the lake. It's really enjoyable and I would both recommend it and drink it again."
221,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.21,750 bottle into teku. Bottled 4/28/2010. A: Pours a deep cranberry juice red with a minimal soft white head that faded into a lasting collar.
222,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.75,"Sorry Contillon and Bokkenrijder, this is the best lambic I have had! Worth the hunt, worth the money, worth every single minute you give it. Wow! It is almost hard to put into words how much is going on, yet so much on a delicate scale. Plenty of sweeter red wine elements, grapes, sherry booze, lemon, plus other fruits like orange, peach and pear. Then there is the hay, earthy, and beet sugar base that crops up in fun and balanced sips. Plenty of funk, barrel elements and oak to boot. Little bit of everything, amazing!"
223,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.02,Brown appearance without a head. Aroma is a dark fruit caramel that is slightly sweet. Taste is also a dark fruit and raisin with some caramel that is a little hollow.
224,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.5,"BBA Expedition Stout was the white whale I have been endlessly searching for. The base beer has been a favorite of mine for 2 years and I finally found the BA version in Grand Rapids, MI. The base Russian remains predominant and is blended with the sticky bourbon. One of the very few beers where the base beer beats the barrel head-to-head. The nose is 10/10 and tops off the experience. IG: @firesidewithphil"
225,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.18,"16oz can from Brewers Haven. I didn't get the chance to hit Surly when I was in MN, so I'm glad we're finally seeing distro here. This one of the beers that put them on the map, and it's a throwback to the old days of in your face hoppiness. Dark golden pour with a lasting soft, foamy head. You can detect a hint of caramel malts in the aroma before the hops take over. Taste begins and ends with the hop bitterness, woody, piney, sharp. This what DIPAs used to taste like. Thanks for the memories."
226,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.29,"12oz bottle with no date on it. Pours a viscous black with no head. Zero lacing. Boozey aroma with vanilla, molasses, caramel and chocolate syrup. The taste is the Bourbon up front followed by dark chocolate, roasted malts, earth, tobacco and espresso. Woody, Bourbon finish with some cocoa. About as much alcohol heat as expected. Very low carbonation with a mouthfeel that is slightly lighter than expected. Overall, a great variant of an already great RIS."

229,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.79,"2018 Dark Star Coffee Edition from Freemont Pitch black, thick, and oily. Dark dark dark brown around the edges and no light coming through. Half finger of mocha colored head dissipated quickly into smaller islands of lace that rest on top. The aroma is crazy layered and intense. The slightest hint of bourbon tickles my nostrils first, followed quickly by fudgy chocolate and a bitter roast underneath. Layers and waves of flavor hit some warmth and bourbon tingle the tongue to mix with dark chocolate, bitter coffee roast, and fudge. The mouthfeel is tricky, feeling chewy at times, but never thick. There’s no trace of the alcohol content in this. The barrels have lent the perfect amount of bourbon flavor without overpowering other elements. This is fantastic, and has achieved perma-want status!"
230,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.49,"Smells most prominently of ripe (not overripe/mushy) cantaloupe with secondary notes of citrus and a kiss of grassiness. Taste mostly follows the nose: big cantaloupe up front followed by a light oniony bite. A swells of hoppy sweetness then fades into a clean grassy bitterness. A light citrus undertone carries through the palette and finish. A delicate crackery malt presence carries through and lingers long after the sip. Mouthfeel is on point. This beer is hazy, it is not turbid and it certainly doesn't feel chewy like many recent NEDIPAs. The body is as full as it needs to be to support the hop character and alcohol, but it never detracts from the beers other features.  World-class"

232,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.35,"Wonderful. This brew, the 2018 vintage, is a very dark, nearly black brown color with ruby highlights. The head is think and light tan. The aroma is boozy, malty, peppery, and has a background of ripe fruit, spice, wood, and molasses. Balanced taste with warmth and a mouth-coating smoothness. This is one incredible beer."
233,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,3.78,"9/15/2021 Very hazy light amber, almost the color of orange juice, unusual bubbly head, recedes fairly quickly to a bubbly cap; nice rich smell; Mild tasty flavor; mouthfeel is okay, moderately carbonated; Good, but not exceptional. Most people rate this beer much higher than I did. Maybe it'll grow on me."
234,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.5,"fresh can drank on 11/5/2016 very hazy golden look. the smell is super potent of tropical flavors. the taste is bursting mango and papaya on top of lots of tropical flavors. very drinkable, shocking this is 11%. overall a really nice tropical bold DIPA. Trying to think of what this compares to but I can't come up with much...maybe a poor man's King JJJJJ but doesn't matter. Great job HH!!!"
235,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.18,"Stark black with a surprisingly high rising dark mocha foam. With a slight hiss, it slowly settles down to a slick smooth surface with a thin ring. Dark sticky brown legs display after a swirl. Smell is dark chocolate syrup, dark fruit, charred bourbon barrel, pulverized maple-glazed nuts, and, at the tail end, a slight sting. Taste brings sweet black cherry skin with dark chocolate, a hint of marshmallow and cocoa dusted fig, as purple grape gummies arise in the swallow. The bourbon doesn’t seem to come through as much as I expected in flavor. Aside from a bit of char, it’s almost closer to Port when combined with the formidable clout of the Dark Lord and his bulbous cherries. Thick, viscous, syrupy and gloppy with a barely there fine fizz and a slightly stinging heat, BADL finishes sticky and semi-dry. Well, what else did you expect? 2017 sparkly green wax vintage"
236,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.37,"Pours pitch black in color with a big, spongy mohagony colored head. Smell is of chocolate covered coffee beans, together with a lighter roast and licorice quality to it. Packs a decadent bitter chocolate smack among accentuating caramel and a note of charred coals. This has an incredibly smooth and silk mouthfeel, featuring a decadent, fuller body. Each sip drinks utmost creamy and soft, with a long lasting burst of flavors. Tastes of sugar glazed coffee beans, lending milk chocolate and a rustic dryness to roasty, spicy malts. Offers a phenomenal creaminess then with bitter chocolate and licorice, balanced by a fair amount of toastiness. Develops a late, well working, espresso rock sugar peak, which hid underneath the licorice for the longest time, blending well into the chocolate, covered by a late, dry bean appearance. This is quite the coffee stout. While this ranges definitely a little more on the sweeter side, it packs a great amount of roast, whipped cream and dry coffee, establishing a fantastic balance and depth."
237,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.28,"Thanks for the can Kevin! A- Tallboy to a small snifter with a murky yellow-orange body and a one finger, frothy cap. Decent head retention as the crown falls to a small ring around the edges. Spotty lacing is seen rarely around the glass. S- Bright orange juices and juicy citrus fruits (mandarin, tangerine) come out on the front end of the aroma and burst out of the glass. Plenty of other hops to back that with peach, bubble gum, mango, apricot, papaya and dank weedy herbs. Hops hops hops. Bright, clean and fresh. T- The citrus hops pick up a lot and shift more towards the grapefruit and orange part of the spectrum but stay fresh, juicy and zesty. The bitterness also picks up and is on the level of biting into a citrus peel, intense and sharp. Peach and mango are downsized here and bubble gum, dank weed, pine resin, berries, bitter Seville orange marmalade and hop powder astringency join in as well.  MF- Smooth creaminess and puffy texture to the medium bodied ale. A high level of carbonation and a silky feeling on the palate. Ends rather bitter and sharp gripping the taste buds. The aroma had me very excited as it is truly brilliant with bursting citrus juices, smooth tropical nectars and dank herbs exploding from the glass; truly balanced and fresh hop aromas. The flavor sees an intense bitterness and astringent powdery feeling taking over and pushing those more delicate flavors to the backburner."
238,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.32,"2019 vintage. A: Pours an inky black, viscous, with no head or lacing.  S: Dark cocoa, a bit of roast, oaky rye with a hint of spice (anise, nutmeg), vanilla bean,  T: Dark cocoa, vanilla, light and almost burnt roast, caramel, moderate honey sweetness, a bit of tannic oak/rye, with a long elegant finish. The sweetness complements the dessert-y flavors nicely.  M: Full bodied, thick and mouth coating, with light carbonation and medium alcohol warmth. O: Solid BA stout but not quite world class. Reminds me of those cocoa-forward BCBSs from the early 2010s."
239,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.95,Another one I had for the first time in 2020. Typically I don't care for beer that has chile peppers infused but this one hits the nail on the hand. The perfect blend with cinnamon.
240,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.64,"Exactly what you want a German chocolate cake stout to taste like. Coconut and chocolate throughout with great body and aromas. Maybe a little on the sweet side, but we are splitting hairs at that point"
241,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.62,"Pours a fiery amber, really love the color. Light haze, small head. Great smell. Even greater taste, wow. That's what's up! Medium mouthfeel. I'm wishing I bought more than one of these. Also they should make this a year-round staple. Definitely one of the best DIPA's I've ever had."
242,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.71,"From an undated can (which I bought at the brewery 2 days ago, so assuming it's very fresh), pours a deep, hazy orange. Minimal head and lacing. Smell is incredibly complex, with a big blast of strawberries, followed by passionfruit, orange, tangerine, lemon and mango.  Taste is initially a huge hit of fresh pink grapefruit, like fresh-squeezed juice, before transitioning to a parade of other citrus and tropical fruits. Earthy notes, a hint of malt. Big, dry, wonderfully bitter finish. Feel is on the light side. Of all the beers I had from a recent trip to Trillium, this is my favorite. Wish I'd bought more."
243,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.45,L — Deep black body with a minuscule light brown head produced with aerated pour. Looks basically still 
244,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.62,Dark black label with red lettering. The beer itself is absolutely black as well...and the aroma that rises from the glass when pouring is incredible. It is like a boozy fruit syrup scent. Wow. The taste is powerful...warming...fruity and intense. Bitter and alcoholic and rich. Wow. This is an incredible beer.
245,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,3.92,"Thanks Brad, served in a Lost Abbey Teku glass because that's the way God intended. This probably goes without saying because the geniuses at Lost Abbey are incapable of getting it right at all but this beer is severely over carbonated, dangerously so. Lost more than half the bottle to the gush and the bottle was served super cold and we were anticipating the gush, regardless, it was a gusher. Beer is pink / ruby and really hazy with a thin pink head of small and medium bubbles, low retention, lots of carbonation, no lacing. Aroma is sweet cherries, tart, mildly acetic, mildly lactic, some succinate in there, interesting, mild earthiness and sulfur, smells like a cherry lambic. Beer is bright on the palate from both the carbonation and the mild acetic character to it, very tart in the corners of the mouth and very good overall. It is still quite sweet and if there is fermentation happening in the bottle I fear what this beer will become.  On a side note, this was sampled side by side with the ""batch 1"" release that was reportedly too sour to serve. It was still a gusher but not nearly as bad, kind of slow motion gusher. The beer was clearer, still ruby / red / pink, thinner head, more acidic but not overly sour. I heavily preferred the ""batch 1"" to the batch two for more reasons than the difference in carbonation, it was a better beer. My score reflect the batch two though since if you are one of the few people cool enough to get a bottle of this for on site consumption at that prick bar in SF, this is the one you will get."
246,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.36,"Pours black with an everlasting ring of tan head that leaves sparse dots of lacing. Smells of bourbon, oak, coffee and char. Tastes of bourbon, cold brew coffee, oak, dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted malts char, vanilla, caramel and a hint of tobacco. Full bodied, light carbonation, creamy and chewy mouth feel and a dry finish."
247,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.85,"I'm not a BBA guy but this beer. Mother of god this beer is fantastic. Perfect amount of bourbon. The mouth feel is up there with Triple Shot as a chewy, thick stout. The only knock on this beer is the fact that I can't get more of it. A++ and a must trade for."
248,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.76,Bottle picked up from brewery today. 
249,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.72,"This fine beer was on tap at Cigar City on July 9th through July 11th. I took down notes at that time, but it's so hard to forget a beer this good! The brewery served this beer to me in a Cigar City snifter. This beer was thick and black that the beer coming out of the tap looked like the tap was pouring used motor oil out of an old car. Luckily there isn't a mechanic next door so I knew this beer instead of oil. No highlights in this beer whatsoever. Not any light source that can be found on this world would have the power to shine through this beer. I could have taken the beer outside of the tasting room and held it up into the bright Tampa sun and not one streak of light would penetrate this beer. Surprisingly, there was a nice head of foam on this beer. The initial head of foam was about 1/4 of an inch in height and dark mocha in color. It had Good renetion that left behind a few spots around the edge of the beer and some tiny blots of lace around the glass.  The aroma was just as thick as the appearance. Up front it was super sweet with the rich scent of caramel, vanilla, molasses, and candy sugar. It was so sweet that I thought I was going to get a cavity just smelling this beer. After the sweets had enough, in comes some roasted malt, a sprinkle of roasted coffee, a drop of dark chocolate, a whiff of oak, and a touch of apple brandy at the finish line. I liked how there was plenty of aromas to keep my nose busy, but I especially liked how every aroma had their equal time in the spotlight.  As you could probably tell already, the taste was just as thick as the appearance and the aroma. The taste was sweet, but it wasn't as sweet as the aroma. The taste was thick with caramel, molasses, a drop of dark chocolate, vanilla, dark roasted malt, a gentle touch of roasted coffee beans, a little oak, a taste that combined apple brandy and caramel, and then this beer finishes up with an expected gentle splash of chili pepper. I knew this beer is brewed with some chili, but I really wasn't expecting the chili to show up at all. Great surprise!  For a high ABV% thick barrel aged Imperial Stout, this beer masks its high ABV%. There was so much going on in this beer that my body couldn't pick up on the high ABV%. The aftertaste was just as thick as everything else. The aftertaste was filled with roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, oak, caramel, molasses, and more of that gentle chili pepper.  There's no doubt about it! This is truly one of the greatest beers in the world. If you ever see this beer on tap at Cigar City, consider yourself lucky and get about 2 glasses of it."
250,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.09,"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that quickly dissipated leaving some light messy lacing sliding right on into the beer. The smell takes on a quick sour grape to bitter grapefruit and then a subtle grapefruit, semi-sweet grassy contour. Beautifully floral and then a lemony sweet to bitter aroma. The taste takes on the same aroma roaming into a florally bittersweet dry aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the sourness to hit as a good penetrator for the harshness. Overall, this isn't a saison but a really nice American Wild ale."
251,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.56,Big thanks to thebeers for this
252,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.5,"2017 vintage drank on 7/8/17 really great ba beer from HF as expected. Their ba stouts have a unique creaminess to it that really impresses me. Something among the likes of being a milk stout combined with an oatmeal stout to some extent. Whatever it is, I enjoy it. The coffee is not too strong here, but it's presence is felt. The barrel are heavily noticeable and absolutely delicious with the sweet dark chocolate."
253,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.4,"Pours midnight black and thick as motor oil, with a plump head of off-white foam. Deep roasted malt lends coffee like aroma, dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and oak barrel notes. The base beer actually stands out in flavor tremendously, while the barrel character adds vanilla, oak, bourbon, and toffee notes. Full-bodied, medium carbonation, thick, chewy, delicious. Overall, a smooth but heavy sipper and one to enjoy every sip of!"
254,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.54,"Poured from a can dated 9/23/20 into a tulip glass. Pours a thick orange-yellow color with minimal head and some lacing (could be due to a gentle pour). Big scents of orange pulp, pineapple, mango. Really juicy flavors of citrus (orange, kumquat) and the finish is reminiscent of some sort of boba tea concoction I got in Chinatown once, maybe the tapioca pearls. Really pleasant lingering bitterness and hop oils on the palate."
255,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.65,"Beer #1500 is an absolute masterpiece; 2020 vintage, on-tap in Garden City ID and served in a teku. A: Very dark mocha-colored body with clear bronze edges that barely show light; khaki-colored head is small and fades to a consistent ring around the edge of the glass. S: The nose on this is absolutely full of caramelly figs and raisins, this is dark fruit for days. The caramel sweetness leads to impressions of toffee and molasses and rich caramel malts. There is a present vanilla, oak, and spirit character, as well as a ghost-like kiss of spice.  T: The palate follows the nose beautifully with an addition of some chocolate notes that rounds this brew out with delicious, full-palate sweetness; dried dark fruits, caramel & toffee & brown sugar, leathery dryness, mild dark tobacco sweetness, wonderful bourbon character with no real alcohol burn, though your palate knows you are drinking a big beer. MF: Sweet, big body on this one. Viscous and sticky, though also smooth and silky. Just wonderful. O: Loved that I was able to try 5oz of this one and not be stuck with another 17oz; this beer (and style overall) is something I really appreciate in smaller doses. This is incredibly well-crafted, and though I expected it not to live up to the hype, it is absolutely delicious and worthy of its ranking."

258,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.49,"2020 vintage, drank February 18th, 2020. Sadly, this bottle leaked quite a bit in transit - carb was nearly absent, but the taste and nose were terrific. Light bodied, tart, and super smooth with that low carb. It reminded me a bit of a geuze, minus the apple notes. It's only mildly sour and just a bit funky. I really liked this one - wish it hadn't leaked so heavily!"
259,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.59,"I'm a huge fan of Fremont's Barrel Aging Program, and even as Goose Island sold out, Bourbon County remains a brew to benchmark against. It is rare to meet a BA Stout of this caliber and this is exactly what we have with the BBA Speedway. It's good - better than BCBS on their off years. Maybe better than their best."
260,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,3.4,"Currently #185 in the Top 250 beers list. My first Trillium beer...I'm rather excited. CAN: Acquired at Trillium. 1 pint formt with a minimalist white label and a standard pull-tab.  8% ABV. ""Double IPA."" Served cold and fresh into a nonical pint glass. HEAD: ~1cm in height. Off-white colour. Not as dense or thick as would be ideal. ~8 minute head retention. Leaves no lacing as it recedes. BODY: Turbid dull orange. Haziness is obvious. I see no yeast/lees within. Nontransparent as a result of its turbidity. Lacks the vibrance and life I'd expect in a world-class imperial IPA, but it's certainly enticing in a general sense without looking unique or special. I do have to wonder if filtration would render it more attractive (I reckon it would). Appears well-carbonated. AROMA: Tropical fruit is the main note I'm getting. Guava, passionfruit, citrus zest, mango, subdued pineapple, tang. The New World (Galaxy, it seems) hop aroma edges out the more classic hop aromatics for dominance. Not piney, grapefruity, oily, resinous, or overtly bitter. Suggests a fruity imperial IPA with no trace of hop bitterness or alcohol. Not the India Odwalla Ale aroma I've come to anticipate in wilfully turbid IPAs, which is a plus. Doesn't seem yogurty or milk sugar-redolent (also a plus). Aromatic intensity is moderate. I detect no off-notes. Lacks overt yeasty or malty notes (save for generic pilsner malt/wheat sweetness). TASTE & TEXTURE: Mysteriously light on the palate, tending almost a bit thin in spite of its medium-bodied presence on the palate. Has a very brief flavour duration as well. Juicy? Sure, but not full-on India Odwalla Ale thankfully. Mango, citrus zest, pineapple, pale malt sweetness, orange pulp. Somewhat shallow, actually, lacking the hop pungency and depth of hop flavour one would expect in a world class imperial IPA. What it does well is disguise its ABV devilishly well. Hop bitterness isn't present at all, but the erasure thereof seems to come with the tradeoff of losing hop pungency (my main issue with this Johnny-come-lately turbid {I}IPA trend). Well balanced generally speaking, but not dialed in to ideal harmony. Not the most complex imperial IPA out there either, but it's not simple - just wanting in terms of intricacy. Has a pulpy yet thin feel on the palate. Could have a fresher juicier taste. Frankly, I think the hop profile could be better. Well-carbonated. Somewhat refreshing. Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy. OVERALL: I'm not sold on the nascent imperial IPA trend, but this is one of the better executed expressions of the style I've had recently. It flirts dangerously close with India Odwalla Ale territory given its juice-like flavour profile, and were it slightly boozier it would invite comparisons to a well-made Screwdriver, but I enjoy it for what it is even if it's nowhere close to world class level in my book. Not a beer I'd stand in line for or spend $16+ a 4 500ml pack for, but to each her/his own. B- (3.40) / WORTHY"
261,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.43,Canned on 9/16. Opened on 10/08.
262,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.43,"Sweet, tropical hoppy, bready/biscuity, slightly earthy/grassy, and orange citrus nose on this one! Taste follows with a juicy and soft, tropical hoppy, hint of earthy citrus finish...just great in the depth and mouthfeel department! This is outstanding!"
263,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.16,"From a bottle into a snifter...this is a really great use of coconut, probably the best use that I've come across...not over-done, but really solid and layered. Also some slightly bitter coffee notes that harmonize really nicely, and some other sweet and gentle spicy notes, too. Smooth and creamy mouthful that still manages to come to a nice clean finish. This is a good one."
264,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.43,"L: A dark cantaloupe purée with a finger of beige foam fading to a wide climbing ring and tiny specks of lacing. S: Smells of mango, oranges, and evergreens. T: Follows the nose with a decent addition of papaya. F: Smooth with a medium to heavy weight and juicy mouthfeel. O: Holding a 4.71, I expected to be blown away on all levels. For example what criteria are folks using to give the look a 5 I wonder as this looks barely over average for the style. This was a good brew for sure, but in a large and ever more competent crowd."
265,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.77,"This one is damn soft. Almost like sleeping on the marshmallow man or Miranda Kerr’s bosom, these Columbus boys know what they are doing. Maybe they watched Saved by the Bell as kids because this one is straight up as West Coast as it gets. Pair this with a Double Double of beef dip from Phillipe’s, you bet I would. See you later, my children."
266,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.59,"L: Poured from a wax sealed bomber, this beer is visually appealing with a very dark pour and a light tan, thick head."
267,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.36,Full and barrely and lovely. Lacto tartness hides the booze beautifully. Blended such that neither the vinous nor the bourbon-y taste wins out. Closer to a classic Flanders Red than expected. Oh boy.
268,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.86,"Luscious. The aroma and flavor are top notch for a coffee stout, delivering exactly what I’d hoped for. On tap at Haymaker, NYC, I let it sit and warm as the black brew settled down and the brown head eased down to a nice little layer while leaving good spotty lacing. The nose is a robust combo of coffee beans, spent coffee grinds, chocolate, fresh ground coffee, molasses, light soy sauce, roasted malts, charred wood and a malty sweetness from the toasted grains and perfectly blended coffee. The feel is silky smooth and this hides the ABV masterfully, but hot damn I need to profess my love for how tasty the coffee flavors are....wow, delicious. Take the smell above and add in some black licorice, hints of peat moss, cocoa and/or cocoa powder, plus some minor piney notes and flavors that I get after sipping a dark roast Starbucks coffee. There’s a slight bitterness that adds to the experience and livens it up. Bravo."
269,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,3.5,"Split a 37.5 cl bottle at a friend's home. My rating is perhaps low because I was expecting a Kriek. That's what he said he had, but he had apparently already shared that with someone else. This tasted more like sour plums.It's not my favorite style. I could have sworn it is 5.5% abv."
270,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.71,"A- 750ml bottle into a small chalice with a mostly clear golden body and a thick frothy white cap. Good head retention and a fluffy ring remains at the edges. Thick sheets of lace form at each sip. S- Hill Farmstead terroir with some added hops, such an amazing combonation. Lactic tartness from the bigs with notes of underripe stonefruit, passionfruit, apricot, Bretty barn funk, vinous oak and a very slight acetic hint. Bright and balanced between the hops and bugs. T- The hops provide some more balance here as the Brett goes up and the lactic bacteria goes a bit down. Herbal, floral and fruity (stone/citrus) hops with lactic yogurt, fresh crushed wheat, vinous wet oak, vanilla oak degradation and underripe tart apricots. Horsey and a bit barney but still balanced wonderfully. MF- Light body with a solid frothy texture and a high level of carbonation. A hint of slickness and a tart ending. The base beer gets some vinous oaky feels. Wonderful balance between all of the elements and the barrel suits one of the best HF beers there is."
271,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.75,2020 can poured into a snifter. Wonderfully juicy aroma and flavor. Soft enough mouthfeel. It is a great beer experience when hype and reality dance in harmony.

A less than one finger head that disappeared quickly.  Smell- Chocolate, vanilla and bourbon up front. A little spice and cinnamon for extra aroma. I didn’t get any note tones.  Taste- Chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla on the front side and an intense pepper heat for an aftertaste. Very pleasant and next to no boozy flavor.  Mouthfeel- lots of carbonation. You could see the bubbles. Still a smooth finish.  Overall- A fantastic mix of sweetness and bourbon barrel with some heat. Definitely meant to sip and enjoy."

T - tons and tons of fragrant coffee poured over bittersweet chocolate. Vanilla, roast, molasses, a touch of earthy hops. Moderate-low bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness. F - medium-full body with average carb, O - a super-tasty coffee stout. I like the base version better, although perhaps I’m misremembering its quality."
281,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.69,"This beer has always been one that I have admired from afar. I remember when I first joined this site over a decade ago, this beer was #1. Out of the blue, we got a shipment in CO. No idea if this is a one-off shipment or not, but I was elated to find this one hanging on at my local store. Bought at Hazel's in Boulder, CO on 05/13/21. 4 pack of 16 oz cans for $18.49 before tax. Canned 05/08/21, consumed 05/16/21. A&S: Not only is it marked on the cans, but I remember seeing an interview about The Alchemist where John Kimmich was super adamant about not pouring this beer out into glassware. However, I properly rate this beer, I am going to have to make a compromise. Poured a little out for look and smell, drank the rest from the can. Translucent canary yellow beer. Lively looking with bubbles of carbonation rising up. Head a bright white and pours at a little less than a finger, but retains really well in a thin layer and leaves globs of lacing. Aroma is probably my least favorite part of this beer (but still great). I get citrus (mostly lemons), cane sugar sweetness, and some resiny hops. T&M: Spectacular and unique. Even with all the hazys on the market nowadays, this one still stands out. Even though the can clearly states that ""this beer is not intended to be the biggest or most bitter"", but it hits. Huge hop flavors! Most piney and resiny, but with more subdued notes of floral and citrus (grapefruit and some lemon). Slightly spicy towards the finish mostly black pepper and a little chili pepper. Bitter and dry finish. Not as ""juicy"" as other hazys, but it works well with this beer. To John's credit, I do think this beer is better consumed out of the can. I think it really does taste better. Fantastic mouthfeel. It is very crisp but combined with a medium body, this beer's texture is nearly perfect. Overall: Wow! I am so glad I had an opportunity to try this one. Definitely lived up to the hype! Belongs in my top 10, and it is the best Hazy IPA I have ever tried. If you can find it, even for the price, it is amazing and well worth it."
282,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.85,"Appearance - Pours cloudy yellow with nice thin white cap that settles to a thick ring around the glass. Nice sheets of lacing down the glass. Aroma - Huge pinch in the nose of citra hops great juicy slightly bitter aroma of orange and a touch of grapefruit. Nothing else needed.  Taste - Taste is a super balanced combination of sweet orange and bitter citrus peel/grapefruit. Could not ask for a much better taste, no bells and whistles just in your face hops. Alcohol is well hidden. Feel - Medium bodied very soft mouthfeel slightly dry finish. Overall - Overall one of the best DIPAs I have had, the taste is really balanced very easy drinking for 8%."
283,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.75,"Taste: Apple, caramel, raisi"
284,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.63,"2014 bottle, for BA Review #4,000 22 oz bottle, purple wax Pours jet black, thin tan colored head. The bourbon flavors are really deep but mellow - vanilla, toasted marshmallow, honey, a little toffee. Nice dark malt flavors as well, bittersweet cocoa and espresso. Really smooth mouthfeel"
285,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.29,"Black in color with no penetration to light and a fingernail of brown the rim. The aroma is of maple syrup, bourbon, and coffee. I’m tasting coffee, maple syrup, and bourbon. The whole thing is sweet, but with a quick lightly bitter finish. The mouth is lightly chewy and sticky."
286,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,3.67,"Ogv 12 375ml on 172207 Pours a clouded amber color with a small, soon disappearing head, which is unusual for 3F's Geuze, which normally stays coated by a fluffy lacing the whole time. Smells of oak, sweeter blue cheese, stale malts, earthen mushrooms and a wet cellar quality. The typical 3F funk settles also in, together with a nice lemon zest sourness, softer than on their regular Geuze. Leans heavily on the oaken barrel with an intriguing sweet and sour interplay on top. Has a soft mouthfeel with a pleasant complexity to it, amped up by an effervescent finish, holding the sourness in balance. Tastes aqueous, almost flat, with some wood bark and muted toffee malts. Turns more wooden during midpalate with an uncompromising lemon tartness during the finish. The beer ends utmost dry, with a lingering lemon zest tartness, revealing mushrooms, mold and cream cheese.  Actually, this appears less balanced than the regular Geuze, especially next to A&G the OGV is just not as complex. Its late sourness is almost too much to take, overpowering everything else, with just a crisp lemon appearance cutting noteably through."
287,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.79,"The best Mexican style Imp stout I've had, although there is no coffee listed in the ingredients. All flavors are perfectly balanced, with a crucial limitation of cinnamon which can ruin a beer altogether. Smooth and slick with dangerous drinkability for 11.5 ABV. The light pepper heat in the finish just makes you want to raise your glass again and again. Somewhere between dessert and the main course, this one can do it all. Outstanding"
288,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,3.94,"Batch 2, I think. A: Light golden, very good clarity, a fizzy cap of bright white head with largish bubbles in the head despite tight-looking carbonation. No lacing, mediocre retention. S: Pretty aromatic—I can smell the beer from my glass two feet away. Ripe peach, tart lemony twang, earth and light horse blanket. A little spice and leather as it opens up. T: Moderate-high, bracing sourness that sort of shocks you into coherence, with a moderate undertone of peach, tangerine and light funk and barnyard. Long, mouth-pickering lemon and stone fruit finish.  M: Medium-light body and medium-high carbonation. O: I assumed this would be close in character to Nectarine Premiere, which was phenomenal, but this is a fairly pedestrian, overly-sour-fruited sour which is not unlike many other versions coming out from breweries everywhere."
289,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.48,Bomber from tornado lightly chilled
290,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.6,"I pop the top and take a gander. Golden color in the can, and there’s dank hop aromas wafting up to my schnoz. We are on the hop train, baby!!! A fairly aggressive pour reveals very hazy golden color beer with a sudsy bone white head. Gorgeous beer. Meanwhile, my schnoz is being assaulted by dank citrus aromas, primarily tangerine and grapefruit, with some juicy pineapple and a touch of berry. I’m guessing a Mosaic- and/or Citra-hopped IPA/DIPA of the NE-style. The taste is all about the dank - tangerine, touch of grapefruit, delicious pineapple, and more berry flavor than indicated by the nose, and a hint of pilsner malt. Most of all, this is JUICY. Very refreshing, too, but there’s a smidge of alcohol present, so I’m locking in on a DIPA that features the Mosaic hop. The mouthfeel is soft and very full, validating my belief this is a DIPA. And it is world-class, IMHO."
291,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.34,"375ml bottle poured into a snifter  A- pours a pale straw color with a small fizzy white head that lasts a while before disappearing  S- juicy nectarine, barnyard funk, lemon peel T- slightly tart, with juicy gushy nectarine, lemon peel, dried hay, finishes tart  M- med body, low carb, slightly foamy mouthfeel , tart dry finish  O- delicious stone fruit showcase"
292,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,3.97,"taster at last night's share.Pours out a ruddy amber capped with a beige head. Sweet malty aroma, raisins,, woody notes, booze. Taste is a nicely blended sweetness, bourbon more prominent, nice feel."
293,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.51,"Swish pours a light and hazy, golden straw color with full, white, 1-finger head and spotty lacing. The smell is mild with a dose of dankness and a juicy, sweet fruit including guava, pineapple, orange and tangerine with a hint of floral and onion. The taste is rich and sweet, juicy pineapple and guava up front with a bitter and dank, hop bite which balances out the sweetness as it finishes with a hint of grapefruit rind."
294,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,"2015 Vintage. Cracked this bad boy with some friends to celebrate the Cubs win in game 7 since its a Chicago ""area"" beer! Lots of chocolate and bourbon barrel here! Much Much better than the standard Dark Lord swill which is overly sweet! Loved this one!"
295,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.75,Great NEIPA. Has the look and taste that you want from this kind of beer. Hoppy but not too much..I think it beats Sip of Sunshine for flavor and smoothness. (And that says a lot from me).
296,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.69,"Batch 2, poured into a taster. Funky apricots and oak, soft mouthfeel, nice tartness without being super acidic. One of my favorite Side Project offerings to date!"
297,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.49,"Bottled 1-21-15. Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a muddled, opaque, brown coloring, with a halo of off-white head. Nose of caramel, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, and hints of earth and chocolate. Very dynamic and big blend of aromas. Flavors are heavily roasted, with apple and caramel notes forward, followed by heavy toffee, molasses, and bourbon highlights. Subtle ribbons of vanilla, chocolate, cherry, fig, date, and coffee dart in and out of the palate. Rich, heavy, and chewy in mouth, with a slick undertone. The aftertaste is a malt bomb on it's own. Apple, molasses, toffee, and booze linger on past the layered, smooth, slick finish. Pretty damn amazing beer!"
298,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.35,"Had a 10 oz pour straight from the tap yesterday. Looks like a standard BA stout with minimal head and pitch black. I can tell the base is a very solid BA stout, adjunct aside. This one isn't heavy on the barrel, and I don't love the idea of raspberry but it goes great this beer."
299,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.65,"L: pours almost clear, but a cloudy straw yellow with a film of white head"
300,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.83,12 oz can stamped July 2 2019
301,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.5,"Looks, smells, and tastes like passionfruit juice. Unbelievable amount of tropical fruit juice flavors and a very (and I mean very) subtle bitterness. This is a substantial yet crushable pale ale. Pretty close to perfection. 4.5/5"
302,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.34,"2016 Vintage on Draft FW BEERS always look more like a porter than a stout. I tend to like the base beer more than this variant, but this is nothing to scoff at. A very tasty brew indeed!!"
303,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.28,"Pours opaque gold with white head. A tiny bit of lacing. 4.25 Aroma - tropical, guava, mango, melon, cantaloupe, pineapple, orange, bubblegum. 4.25 Taste is definitely smoother and less “tangy” and “sharp” as aroma might suggest. Mango, orange, pineapple, melon. 4.25 Feel is smooth and fluffy and quite silky with light-medium carbonation. 4.5 Overall it’s a tasty DIPA. Hop profile is not my personal favorite, but many will really enjoy it. 4.25"
304,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.42,"A: Pitch black pour with a nearly black head. Very fuzzy and loud. Head dissipates fairly quickly and with no lacing, likely from the barrel aging. S: Killer bourbon aroma. Tons of burnt sugars, caramel and vanilla. Notable cinnamon in there too, melds well with the stinging alcohol. T: Goddamn! Stellar bourbon smacks you in the face immediately. Brown sugar, caramel, oaky vanilla and a touch of toffee. Strong and sharp cinnamon flavor along with booziness cuts the sweetness nicely. Licorice flavor shows up in the finish, not quite a star anise taste but similar. Really helps temper the sweetness, especially with the lingering bourbon flavors in the aftertaste. M: Smooth and almost syrupy but the booziness helps cut it. O: Really fantastic stout. Bourbon is top notch and really enhances the beer without dominating it. Flavors are balanced and complimentary."
305,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.13,Batch 2 bottle purchased at Side Project The Cellar.  Deep saturated clear yellow appearance. Foam dissipates very quickly and none is left after as you drink. Big barnyard funk aroma. Some of that is also present in the taste but additionally a good bit of sour grapes and mild lemon. Medium acidity and tartness. Medium mouthfeel.
306,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.01,2016 vintage (bottle) at the brewery
307,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.14,"Review 1491 I enjoy Toppling Goliath Beers, I have yet to try their darker beers. The best by date is in a week, I need to get this one gone. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a bright white foamy and airy two-fingered head. The dissipation of the head left abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale straw, with golden hues. The beer is mostly clear with some haziness lurking within. The appearance of the beer is elegant.  The initial aromas in the beer are pine needles, grapefruit rind, floral esters, and herbal. Nosing further in the glass, I detect toasted bread crust, lightly toasted malts, oranges, lemons, papaya, and a touch of solvent.  The flavors in the beer are grapefruit, oranges, melons, lemons, guava, pineapple, herbal, floral esters, bready, lightly toasted malts, pine needles, phenols, wet grass, and peaches.  The mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, astringent, and crisp.  The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonations, and a fuller finish.  The one thing that is off-putting in this beer is the carbonation, it is strong, bubbly. The flavors of the hops are wonderful but bitter with a steady malt backbone. A pleasant DIPA, not sure it is worth the high score that it has. I have better DIPAs with the harmony finessed."
308,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.25,"This is a very nice beer, however it fell dramatically short of hype for me. Overall, i felt like it was a very sweet version of prairie bomb, slightly thinner. Overall it is very nice, super smooth for the abv, and tasty."
309,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.66,"Blend #3. Pours a deep, rich brown in color - minimal head, not very much carbonation (favorable, in my opinion). It's tremendously rich and sweet, with a fair amount of hop presence, with a fair amount of barrel - not as much as I'd expected. I think I'd prefer Aaron on any given day, but Anabasis is still tremendously good."
310,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.34,FFBL draft. Holy sour blackberries! This is what a sour is. I enjoy the thick and gloopy fruited stuff but this is a real sour. Tons of lacto on the nose and in the flavor. Nice blackberry flavor with a lot of sour. Puckering! Great fruited sour here.
311,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.99,"A (very expensive) draft pour at TG on release day Dec. 7, 2019.  Look: Not as dark as I expected with a very thin brownish-tan head. Sticks to the glass briefly.  Smell: Lots of phenomenal coffee hit me at first. Much stronger that Mornin Delight. The barrel was there along with dark chocolate.  Taste: The coffee and maple match perfectly. There is some vanilla as it warmed and the barrel was more present. Really delicious  Feel: The carbonation was great. It was unbelievably smooth and lingered with each sip.  Overall: Easily the best beer I’ve had from TG. So complex and drinkable with everything I wanted in a beer. So many stouts with maple but none of them mix flavors like this. Definitely a world class beer. "
312,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.62,"12/2016 - Freshly acquired and immediately enjoyed; so much raisin, plum, tobacco, some apple brandy (not as much bourbon) on the nose; big, boozy plum and tobacco on the palate; semisweet, fairly dry finish."
313,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.36,"16 oz can, dated 2/1/21, best by 6/1/21, into Crane snifter. "
314,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,3.63,Bottle brought by Fux to the Moeder Lambic tasting a few weeks ago. Great time gents! Thanks heaps for sharing this one man.  From a 750 into a tasting glass. 
315,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.65,"2019 vintage - can poured into teku glass. Black with a half inch tan head, dissipates quickly into lacing Nose: Tons of bourbon and tons of dark fruit. Reminiscent of BCBS but more intense. Taste: Intensity is dialed to 11 off the bat. Bourbon, chocolate, and dark fruit. Finish is predictably boozy although smother than I anticipated.  Feel: Full-bodied albeit thinner than expected. Relatively active carbonation keeps it from becoming syrupy."
316,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.93,(L) Pours pitch black with almost no head. (S) Black licorice and booze. (T) Candy aisle salted licorice drops. Faint on the rum but who cares? (F) A little thin but it doesn’t matter  (O) Delicious. Better than I dreamed. Like my favorite candy.
317,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.23,"Bomb is an acquired taste for me, but the BA version is dynamite. It mellows out the heat from the peppers and adds a smooth barrel finish. This is really a solid beer."
318,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.1,"Pours black withi a still, oily look to it. Head foams up to a finger in height, but disappears quickly. Foam is khaki in color. Aroma is booze from the moment the wax-covered bottle cap is cracked open. In addition to heavy booze (via bourbon) is chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, coffee and roasty, toasty malts. There is a hint of char at the finish. Flavor profile follows suit, with sugary notes of chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, caramel and brown sugar mingling with lightly bitter notes of roasty, toasty malts, coffee and char. Booze and bourbon is present throughout, adding a substantial level of heat even after aging the bottle for a couple years. Alcohol turns the finish to dry, rinsing away the initial sweetness. Mouth feel is thick and full, but with a rather still texture. Overall, heavy, filling and with plenty of heat. It's a bottle worth sharing, but sparingly.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle."
319,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.53,Pours slightly cloudy and yet so clean. Head is almost bright white that fades quickly. Lacing is beautiful as expected. Taste is where the magic happens. Not too sour not too plain. Superb offering.
320,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.85,"What?!? Have you seen what this stuff looks like?? Bright fuchsia liquid glowing in my glass. Absolutely astonishing to look at. Nose is all passion fruit...smells amazing. Taste is also all passion fruit with some perfect tartness to finish. Feel is excellent and dry. Overall, this is an amazing berliner and hands down, the most insane looking beer I've ever seen."
321,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.42,"From the bottle, it pours black as pitch as coal with virtually no head. Vanilla, bourbon and alcohol in the nose. The mouth gets the same and more flavors as well. Great flavor!"
322,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.61,"Bottle dated 07.25.2019  From a 12 oz. bottle into a PAA Pirate whiskey glass, this beer pours out with a blackness and forms a pinky worth of caramel colored crown that doesn’t stick around long.  The nose brings botanical rum notes mixing with some marshmallow like vanilla, a fudgey chocolate and a hint of coconut.  The taste brings huge vanilla. Thick marshmallow sweetness mixing with that fudgey, silky chocolate and the botanical rum along with a kiss of coconut. There is somewhat of a graham cracker aspect that bounces in and out as well.  There is a warm barrel booziness that lingers the whole way through. Silky, sticky, full and widely thick with a coating sweetness.  Overall, this is an enjoyable beer. The amount of vanilla that comes through is phenomenal to me. The coconut somewhat gets lost with the rum botanical notes, but can be detected as an accent. What’s crazy is the vanilla marshmallow, sticky sweetness is huge from the start but only comes on more and more as it warms."
323,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.84,"For the 2020 release!: Sweet chocolate-coconut, cinnamon coffee, and hint of bourbon barrel nose on this one! Great aromatics! Taste follows with a thick and viscous coconut-chocolate finish...a little cinnamon coffee bitterness and hint of barrel round out the swallow! As it warms, the cinnamon becomes a bit more prominent, but subtly so and not overpowering. Everything is so well-balanced... just flows and fits together so well. This is world-class!!!"
324,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.53,"01/2017 - Lovely marshmallow, vanilla, wee graham, bourbon up front; sweet, creamy, bourbon, chocolate on body with vanilla lingering; amazing mouthfeel that's chewy and luscious."
325,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.65,"I finally got to try Bourbon Barrel Aged Oro Negro and it was great. It lived up to the hype. It is brewed with Walnuts, conditioned on spices and Aged in Bourbon Barrels. What an explosion of flavors. It is a wonderful stout. Look: Black with a thin mocca colored head Aroma: roasted malts, chocolate, nuts, bourbon. Taste: Roasted malts, walnuts, a little bit of chili peppers, chocolate, some coffee, and very distinct nice bourbon. Body/Overall: full body, creamy, silky, smooth"
326,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.3,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smell is dominated by rich chocolate fudge and an intense cinnamon note, as well as a strong earthy, oaky, peppery rye barrel note and hints of vanilla and chili. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by chocolate fudge, cinnamon and and a subtle but complex rye barrel character of earthy, musty, oaky, peppery notes, as well as lighter notes of roasted malt, vanilla, chili peppers and just a hint of dark fruits. Finishes with a light sweetness and some cinnamon and oaky, spicy notes lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. The cinnamon and chili work really well with the peppery, spicy rye barrel character, although I have to say that the cinnamon presence is way overdone here for my personal taste and that there is also not quite enough of a bitter/roasty counterpoint to the sweeter chocolate and vanilla notes. While mouthfeel is nice and creamy, it's still disappointing compared to Sump as well. Does not live up well to the hype."

328,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.03,"Able to score a goblet on tap from a local Italian eatery...very surprised to find it around here. Slowly, finally, these really good breweries are starting distro in this area. Color is a dark brown. No obvious carbonation but a tiny sliver of head. To touch, the temp was cool to room temp. Aroma was very coffee forward, balanced like a breakfast blend smell. First sips were hot from the alcohol, followed by a smooth coffee presence from front to back of tongue. Mouthfeel was full and left a nice coffee, milk chocolate aftertaste. If I could find this bottled, definitely worth cellaring a few to see how the burn subsides and the flavors develop. It seemed a little one-dimensional fresh, so I imagine aging is a must for this one. The straight Speedway stout seemed to have more complexity fresh. Definitely worth a try."
329,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.5,2017 reserve. Im getting some bourbon and a moderate amount of bitterness which I’m attributing to the wine barrel. Feels experimental and I think it’s worth drinking at least once.
330,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.48,"A real cinnamon-bomb is what we’re dealing with here. Lots of bang-for-the-buck! Superbly balanced, with hints of spice coffee and chocolate. Medium to full body"
331,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.89,"Canned On 05/03/18, 11:10:52. Pours a beautiful mango hued orange, slightly viscous with a frothy two inch head of foam that quickly bubbles away and leaves heavy lace around the glass. Strong tropical aromas, candy sweet. Mango juice, guava nectar, tangerine, and pineapple all play around your nose... no bitter indicators, no booziness.. pure juice. Incredible. More of that candy sweetness. Straight mango juice, with complimentary pineapple and orange. Some lingering bitterness, and hardly any present booze. Absolutely can’t believe this is 10.3%. Medium body, good level of carbonation. No residual stickiness, just pure creamy juice that goes down with a nice warmth.. the only indicator of the high ABV on this beer."

333,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.65,Nice dark yellow color. Strong citrus notes and very hoppy. A lot of sediment at the bottom. Definitely a bit weird to have that much but overall a very tasty Double IPA.
334,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.46,"Glad I finally picked this up... was reluctant to do so at $25, since it hit my ""$1/oz."" personal threshold :-)  Amazingly strong head and lacing... it just doesn't quit."
335,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.32,Pumped to find this for 6 bucks at a giant eagle on the way to a concert. Color on fleek deep dark toxic black thick and viscous with a 1/2 inch of froth. Smell is pretty good black roast coffee deep espresso and can't really pick anything else. Taste is a tough but as it warms mocha and coffee become more refined. Body is heavy of course and abv is a bit harsh.  Overall an awesome find But not sure I would get it again because to me it was the most coffee forward beer I have had in some time
336,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.25,"My first review ever and boy what a great one to start! My impression was how fresh, creamy, hazy, great combo of citrus and tropical with a nice finish. Great all around experience."
337,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.19,"Went to Boston from Alabama with the express goal of getting the New England IPA experience (this is an APA I know).

Mango, apple, pineapple, passionfruit and white pepper in the aroma. Fruit punch city.  Pineapple and other juices show first in the taste, with a moderate, aspirin-like bitterness throughout that lingers into the aftertaste. Medium bodied with a slow-building, tight fizziness. A bit more apple than I prefer in an IPA, and the bitterness and fruitiness are a little incongruous to my taste. It’s decent enough, but not my favorite from these guys."

346,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,5.0,"Oddly enough, this beer is exactly as they described it. Thick, beautiful orange juice pour, Doughy mouthfeel, and loads of papaya, mango, pineapple, and doughy yeastiness. Very well hidden 9%. Really loved this. Very recommended."

348,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.5,"Celebratory birthday beer for my wife. Nose is intense and let's u know right away they didn't skimp-out on the crazy good adjunct. Bourbon, chewy, toasted coconut and marshmallow. As much coconut as Prop14, but lacks the complexity and smooth nature of a Prop. Really impressed tho"
349,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.87,"oil black with a dark creamy head, looks amazing. smell is pure chocolate coffee with a slight booze. taste is full of coffee and chocolate but isn't overly sweet, it has a nice booziness to it. Some maple syrup with slight bourbon to it. Has a nice smokiness to it. Everything together makes this a killer beer, it isn't overly sweet or milky."
350,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.67,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass. Canned on 3/1. Hazy orange color, like mango nectar with off-white lacing and some minimal effervescence. Juicy tropical fruit on the nose: mango, pineapple, some undertones of dank hops. Big flavors of peach and stone fruit to start, some topical fruit. Really mellow finish, perhaps due to the addition of honey. I might even get a hint of sweetness on the aftertaste if I’m not imagining it. Chewy smooth mouthfeel. This is a really enjoyable beer. It packs a punch but really hits on all cylinders."

352,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.17,"A - Pours a dark black body, with a brown-red highlights. Light tan head, lining the edge at the glass, and a cast across the top. S - Strong booze note of bourbon and vanilla, a note of nuttiness. T - Strong hits of coconut and vanilla, a touch of fruit and maple sweetness, wood and chocolate and coffee acidity, long lingering mild bitterness in the close. M - Mild carbonation, moderate weight, slightly sticky feel but a dry finish. O - Well built and tasty, it delivers a huge barrel experience."
353,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.83,"An amazing hazy New England IPA like one know that Tree House can do: extremely fruity with a nice, easy-going better twist to it. The real juice, for sure!"
354,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.5,"Bottled 2/24/16; drank 5/13/16 @ Golgi Apparatus.  Brown/black appearance.  Big, noisy tan head; nice lace.  Roasted coffee bean, fresh flowers & milk chocolate notes in the nose; unique!  Medium mouthfeel.  Roasted coffee bean & cream flavors up front; milk chocolate notes on the finish. Fresh flower notes emerged as this warmed.  The floral touches added unexpected depth to an already strong porter; great!"
355,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.06,"Meager dusting of tan foam which is pretty much gone just as the pour settles, in turn no lacing to speak of but one really wasn’t expecting much of either. Light and fully transparent brownish red with wide yellow rims, while the bubbles are about as miniscule as imaginable there are steady streams of them. The sour cherry scents stunted by caramelized brown sugar and molasses notes, touch of coconut flakes, more vinegary than vinous, turns to pie dough and Ovaltine, not as high-toned as expected nor as generally powerful. Medium-bodied, has acidic punch and feels very firm in the mouth. The cherry, currant fruit flavors strong here but so is the oak. Grilled nuts, cocoa, molasses to at times more American oak dill accents. Clean attack, gets funkier towards the finish and retronasally. No astringency, dryness or deep puckering sensations, balanced and approachable. No alcoholic heat either. Even as one notes this, it bears the stamp of a wild ale, albeit mannered. The grip extends the texture a good bit after the flavors have subsided. Not discerning noticeable change as it warms towards room temperature. Suavely arrayed."
356,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.75,2019 version poured from the bottle into a snifter. This has a wonderful vanilla flavor and the high ABV percentage is incredibly hidden. Excellent!
357,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.91,"This is pretty much Maple Bacon Coffee Porter. It is extremely sweet as the original but it is better balanced by the higher booze. Pours thick and creamy, crazy to think it's a porter."
358,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.74,"Pours a clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is relatively subdued. Little bit of funkiness and typical Saison aroma. The flavor is where this beer really shines. Absolutely exquisite says on with the perfect amount of tartness to balance it out and add that punch to each sip. Chardonnay notes come through very nicely. Mouth feel is as you would expect for a beer of this style. Overall, this may be the very best Saison I've ever had"
359,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.61,"This one pours a very hazy golden yellow color, with a small fluffy head, and lots of lacing. This smells like sweet grapefruit, tangerine, mango, pineapple, and orange creamsicle. This really does hit all of the marks for this style. It brings me back to 2014 and 2015 when I was still really into IPAs. It's very hop saturated and verdant, with sticky citrusy hop character, pineapple, and mango. There's a healthy bitterness here, and it's all very well balanced. This is medium bodied, very creamy, and very refreshing, with a really nice drinkability to it. This is one of the best IPAs that I've had in a while now. It's a really great accomplishment."
360,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.3,"Serving: 16 oz can (“PKG05/07/21… BEST BY 09/04/21”) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Appearance: Hazy amber gold with a rocky head of sudsy white foam and sticky lace. Smell: Aromas of fresh fruit - oranges, grapefruit mangos, pineapple and papaya. Taste: Beautifully balanced fruit flavors held up by solid malt backbone: orange, mango and pineapple. Gentle bitterness. Mouthfeel: Medium body, creamy smooth feel and moderate carbonation. Overall: Bursting with clean and familiar tropical fruit notes, a balanced and enjoyable double NEIPA."
361,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.45,"Appearance: Very black glass shows an angry ruby red edge with strong back light. Doesn't hold a head. Aroma: Soy sauce, sour barrel note, some very dark malt. Taste: Sweet, but holds short of cloying. Deep malt, barrel notes, bourbon, mild citric note, chocolate, dark fruit (raisin), maybe a little vanilla?  Mouthfeel: Heavy body, no carbonation, chew, oily texture, fairly clean finish with a oily coat. Overall: Like bourbon? Yeah, plenty of that here, but it's a malt bomb. Very sweet, dense, almost brownie like. A good one to share or sip slowly."
362,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.69,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a thin khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of coconut, vanilla, marshmallows, and rum. It tastes of toasted coconut, vanilla, marshmallows, and rum. The feel is medium light, sticky, and incredibly smooth. A great barrel aged stout from Prairie, tons of flavor but so drinkable."
363,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.74,"Have had several year's ""vintages"" of this outstanding brew. While it packs quite a punch, it is delicious to drink. Usually make a point of grabbing several bottles when in the Windy City."
364,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.92,"Beautiful, light pink/purple color. Medium carb and light feel. Full flavor with sweet plum and some lemon flavor. Really easy to drink, refreshing and hard to put down. Outstanding"

366,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.6,Delicious Trappist Ale. Price can't be beat compared to Westvelten. This is a go to beer for Fall / Winter. Cant believe how close this is to the WestV. The lack of a creamy finiah is the real difference
367,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.59,"Double Citra pours a milky and creamy orange color with a complex white cap on top that lingers leaving some impressive lacing. The smell is a true NE style DIPA, big and juicy on the nose with layer upon layer of Citra hops bringing out the citrus and tropical fruits including mango, grapefruit, peach and a hint of melon with some earthy tones and an herb quality. The taste, this is closest I've come to a perfect beer. Wow! This Double Citra tastes amazing, very soft and smooth over the palette with a light body that brings out orange, tangerine, grapefruit and some melon sweetness with a subdued bitterness."
368,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.63,"Opened a 2 1/4 year bottle that had been in my refrigerator for just about as long. Pours a dark translucent brown with a fair amount of sediment. Initially the light tan head is tall and fluffy. It subsides to a light ring. Smells of bread, yeast , brown sugar and raisins. Tastes of yeast, spice and raisins with a slightly bitter finish. The high alcohol level hides very well contributing some heat to the end of each sip. Medium body and carbonation. Lush mouthfeel but lighter than I would have expected for a beer with such a big character. This one deserves its World-Class ribbon !"
369,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.53,"Very well done beer, aroma and taste are a big leap from KIng Julius, however not enough for the price of admission. It would be better to get a six pack of regular jjjulius over this one and be just as enjoyable, 6 times over.  It was worth trying, but not special for all the extra effort"
370,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.23,"750ml bottle, batch 2. Supposedly 4x the coconut addition of the first batch. It shows, it has way too much coconut in it, which doesn't mesh very well with the big chocolate fudge of the base beer. It is too intense on both counts, which normally is not a bad thing but they just don't really balance well with each other. It's too sweet and weirdly cloying. Full bodied, creamy, thick and viscous- but the coconut and the imperial stout just didn't work. I think it just needed the barrel aging to really smooth it out and add something to break up the weird duopoly of sweet coconut and sweet chocolate malt."
371,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.08,"375 mL bottle. Black body. Smells of nutty malts, oak, bourbon, chocolate. Tastes much better. Chocolate cut by oak and licorice. Bourbon. It’s sweet, but it has a really nice dark fruit complexity in the back end. Finish is charred oak. Heavy, pretty sweet. Excellent flavor, but it’s pretty alcoholic."
372,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.85,"Patrickbaeki Thailand I drink this beer 11 months old a dark brown beer with an Ivory colored head foam. Aroma : Chocolade , fruity , spicy and malt. Taste : Complex taste with notes of chocolade and raisins."
373,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.53,"Coffee bomb... nice, smooth coffee though, not overly bitter. Chocolate notes and some bourbon on the finish. When it finally hits room temp it’s all coffee"
374,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.56,"Huge sugary maple nose, like someone spilled a bottle of Syrup. Full bodied, super slick & smooth mouthfeel. Taste is significantly more coffee-forward than expected, with the maple really coming through on the finish. Hides 11% ABV incredibly well."
375,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.43,"375ml bottle, served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pours a dark black body, oily, with a bit of hulky leg, one finger offwhite head, short retention, bits of lacing. Smell is chocolate fudge, bourbon, a bit of nuttiness, slight roast, earth, a bit of espresso. Flavour is an unholy mix of bourbon, chocolate fudge, slight vanillin, brownie batter, touch of almond and roast, mildly earthy finish. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, slightly lower carbonation than would be expected. Overall, an excellent barrel-aged imperial stout that hides its 15% abv extremely well. Holy cow."
376,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,3.93,"Sample from bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Beautiful chestnut colour. No carbonation, and accordingly no head. INTENSE aroma of port wine, dark dried fruits and fusel alcohols. The latter unfortunately detracts from the aroma score. Intense, concentrated and sweet flavour of old madeira, raisins / rum-raisin and oak."
377,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.46,"Bottle with a 2013 sticker. Reluctant to rate because this is such a distinctive beer, at once subtle and strong, and this is the first time I've had anything by Cantillon. I found it amazing, but also palate challenging. It's kind of like first time listening to Coltrane. You're not sure how to describe it or judge it, and you're at once thrilled and in over your head, but you know repetition seems really worth pursuing and will alter your tastes."
378,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.43,"Hazy yellow with a soft film and thick collar. This is a milkshake IPA in disguise. Vanilla and Orange Julius flavors come through a creamy body that has a soft but tingly carbonation expanding softly on the palate. This is accented by green eucalyptus and wild weeds before the semi-dry finish brings out some smoothing oats, brightening Smarties and kiwi."
379,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.56,"This was Batch #2. Toffee, caramel, bourbon, and earthy fruit. Easy to see why this brew is in such high demand. Cory King is a magician, flexing his muscle in every style."
380,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.46,"Bottled 1-6-21, just over 1 month old. Hazy pale orange with a twofinger tight white head. Aroma is of tangerine juice and dankness. Taste is blast of orange and tangerine juice, soft to low bitterness, hint of garlic and onion towards the end. Light to medium body. Ends dry. Way too easy to drink."
381,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.59,"Cherry red with a touch of amber, lots of carbonation, a hint of haze, and a finger of Pepto Bismol pink head. Smells acidic and fruity, of vinegar, cherries, spices . Notes of cloves and nutmeg, deep, cellar like funk, and dusty attic, just like the Cantillon Brewery where I purchased this masterpiece at the end of 2013.  Sour, dry and fruity. Very acidic but with a softness that makes it non abrasive. The essence of cherries and red fruits are in there, along with the breweries classic funk and cellar and dust. Cobwebs come to mind, and macaroni. Floral notes are also present. Medium body, moderate, foamy carbonation, and a very dry but smooth finish. The label says 2011, so when I purchased this in Brussels at the brewery in 2013, it was already 2 years old. Today its been in the bottle for 5 years. Amazing, legendary, classic brew I've been cellaring in China and now in Thailand for 3 and a half years. It was one of my favourite days in Belgium, the day I got this brew. May 7th, 2017."
382,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.39,"375ml bottle, blend 1. Served in a stemmed glass 4/30/2016. Pours a medium yellow-orange body, somewhat hazy with a one finger white head. Smells of rich underripe stone fruit, with mild cereal grainy sweetness, oak, and a fair bit of lactic acid. The stonefruit seems to tame down the lactic acid nicely. Flavour is a great balance of stone fruit and lactic acid, which is a bit more restrained than past fruited 375's that have come and gone. Touch of oak, mild funk, cereal grain, peach skin. Mouthfeel is medium-lighter bodied, light and dry on the palate with underripe fruit skin on the finish. A very nice one indeed- remarkably heavy on the fruit, which is a good thing in my book."
383,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.69,"Batch 3. Into a a wine snifter This is the biggest baddest dark sour out there. There is nothing subtle going on here. Big sour, big bourbon, big body, big cherry. Tobacco thrown into the mix too. A sipper."
384,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.46,Huge upfront acidity while cold with a nice sweet juicy feel as it gets closer to room temperature. I wouldn't exactly call this a fruit or a tart bomb but runs a nice balance of both.
385,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.59,"2016 vintage poured from a 22 oz bomber moderately, resulting in a three-quarter inch tan head over a very dark brown body with some lacing. Wonderful nose of chocolate foremost with a bit of booze from the bourbon barrels as well. Taste mirrors nose with a chocolate flavor that won't quit. Not too boozy at all, but the bourbon is definitely there. Very nice mouthfeel, and overall, what a treat. Cheers!"
386,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.56,"Can dated 9 June, 2021. Nice pale orange hue with a frothy head, plenty of haze. The is a glorious dankness to this nose - full of pine and funk and juicy tropical fruit. That all gets amplified in the palate. Crushable fruit from the islands - all good and ripe: pineapple, mango, banana, guava and the addition of tangy citrus. The hoppiness is well supported in this too. Just a lovely output."
387,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,5.0,"Had this next to Genealogy (On tap in Lincoln, Nebraska) Look - Jet black, little bit of khaki head. Smell - Chocolate, dark fruit, a hint of the barrel. Really nice. Taste - Really exceptional. Perfection. So smooth, just a hint of coffee. One of the best Barrel Aged Stouts I have ever had. Mouthfeel - Thick, chewy, wonderful. Perfection! Overall - (A+) This one really belongs on Beer Advocates Top 250. A lot of impostors out there, this one is The Real McCoy. Highly recommended!"
388,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,3.38,"16 oz. can. Pours a hazy and murky orange. Smells of strong garlic, passion fruit, and some sweet tropical fruits. Tastes of sharp and intense hops. Strong garlic, acidic fruits hops. Brief sweetness before it becomes earthy and garlicky bordering on oniony. Earthy and sharp finish. Medium heavy, intense, and a little slow to drink. I love hops like this, but this is quite intense. A bit too sharp for my tastes, but it's not bad."
389,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.47,"Canned 4/20/21. L: Pours an opaque gold with a fluffy head that reduces to a film. Beautiful splotchy lacing. S: Orange, pineapple, mango, cantaloupe. Juicy Fruit gum. T: The fruit leads, followed quickly by a drying bitterness. There's no middle here, just a front and back. The juxtaposition is a bit unexpected but not at all unpleasant. F: Typical Tree House soft mouthfeel, just outstanding. O: An extremely enjoyable taste experience. The quick transition from Juicy Fruit to grapefruit is unique and delicious."
390,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.94,"This one blew me away! Poured like motor oil and was close to pitch black in color. Silky thick mouthfeel. Chocolate vanilla flavor was off the chart, but was not overdone. Very sweet pastry stout, but was not cloyingly sweet...just right."
391,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,3.81,"Hazed dark orange with a finger-and-a-half of antique white head. Thick lacing. Mango, peach and a peppery-burnt-herbal thing in the nose. Similar tasting with a sweet tea impression on the back end. Medium bodied with heavy carbonation. Not my favorite in this series. 10/4/17 canned on date."
392,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.29,"2019 Vintage Original June 30th, 2021 ratings for the 2016 vintage: 3.75 4.5 5.0 4.75 4.5 The appearance is the same. The smell is way more subdued; heavy sweetness and dark, pitted fruit. The flavor remains outstanding, but like the smell, a bit more low-key; heavy sweetness; spicy; raisins and figs. The mouthfeel is also heavy, slick and oily. Perhaps the aging of the 2016 version fine-tuned many of the aspects of the beer. The 2019 version is still pretty remarkable and inviting itself, but it just doesn't reach some of the extraordinary levels the older version does. Then, too, this beer starts off colder than when I had the 2016 version, so that may deaden some of the beer's highlights. Poured at 50 °F ------------ 2016 vintage (fourth release) Flat and still, murky and deep, dark brown body; no real carbonation or head noted. Old, smokey wood staves on the nose; ancient dark pitted fruit, figs and dates. An immensely deep and sensual taste; raisin, date, fig, cinnamon, anise; cerebral notes of heady spices and rich, succulent malts; boozy yet subtly subdued. Heavy body; oily; slick and slippery; huge residual sugar note; warm and coating on the palate. This beer exudes fig newton qualities, but deeper and more divine in nature. This is a godly liquid that oozes spirituality. Poured out at 65° F."
393,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.96,Loved the complexity of this beer! Look was quite bubbly and minorly cloudy. Aroma and taste had a great deal of complexity and funkiness. I did enjoy the vastness of this beer in contrast to the great but simple oude gueuze. Would definitely pursue this beer again. Not easy to find.
394,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.99,Great compliment to the standard Haze offering. Showcases an impressive amount of hops and sass (you'll forget it's 8.6%). Has the signature Tree House mouth feel. Definitely worth tracking this one down.
395,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.93,"2010 vintage from 3 Fonteinen cellar on 3/30/2018. One of if not the best Gueuze I've ever had. Incredibly smooth, perfect blend of funk, sour, biscuit. The oak shines through on the back end. One of the best beers out there Gueuze or otherwise."
396,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.5,"On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma has some sweet malt and fruity lambic notes. Taste is tart, fruity with floral yeast notes, some honey, clean malt and a hint of butterscotch. Really balanced and tasty."
397,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.33,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 375mL bottle* This beer poured an orangeish-brown ran color, a bit murky. There was an initial two finger thick white colored head to it, but it almost immediately disappeared as soon as it was poured into my glass. The head left a razor thin white colored lacing around my glass. Needless to say, this beer was super funky, probably the funkiest beer I've had so far. Upfront, I got notes of leather, oak, pinot, and generally just funky horse blanket. In the back-end, I got a bit more notes of sour cherries, but the fruitiness that was present wasn't nearly as prominent as the earthy and funky aromas that I got in the front. As expected, this beer was very sour forward and funky. I got big notes of acetic acid upfront along with a nice funk from the brett, both were coupled with prominent notes of oak and pinot. The sourness mellowed a bit towards the middle and end, where the beer showcased more of its sweet/tart cherry notes in the middle, followed by a slight but noticeable bready malt character in the finish. Truly a nice balance between the flavors of the cherries, barrel, and brett/lacto/pedio. This beer was medium bodied and had a medium amount of carbonation to it. The beer also left a little drying sensation in my mouth. Obviously this was super sour and puckering, but I still thought that this was relatively drinkable. I probably would never chug this down, but still really drinkable. Overall, this was a very good wild ale. This beer was very balanced, showcasing nice notes of its barrel character as well as the cherry and notes of the bacteria. I'm not typically a big fan of sours, but I definitely enjoyed this one and would definitely buy this again if given the chance."
398,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.08,"In the interest of fairness, I am not a huge fan of hazelnut. There is something of putting about the overall profile. That said, at the front the thick boozing this is very apparent. Lingering about the mouth, the hazelnut was very easy to detect. The field was very sticky and sweet, swinging easily to the sides of the mouth. The feel was almost chewy. Raisins and dark fruit were also present. Yet in the overall scheme of things, the hazelnut make this hard for me to like."
399,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.49,"On draft at the Alpine Pub. My first time having Bad Boy and it may be the best beer I've had from Alpine. Incredible aroma and wonderful hop flavor, but without overwhelming bitterness. Incredibly drinkable at 9%."

Vintage: 2017 L: Motor engine oil black, viscous, dark beige head S: Fudge.... lots of fudge, some vanilla, oak  T: Lots of fudge, dark fruit, charred oak, about as perfect a non-adjuncted stout can be F: Heavy mouth feel that has a lot of weight behind it. Cascades from start to finish with a surprisingly drier finish O: One of the best non-adjunct stouts I've ever experienced."
402,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.75,12/9/2020: Poured into a snifter. Nicely thick. Coats my tilted glass. More maple and vanilla than coffee and coconut but this is very very tasty.
403,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,5.0,"When I first cracked this, it was the first beer from Trillium that I had ever had. I have now come to think that Trillium is second in New England only to Hill Farmstead."
404,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.65,"Poured pitch black with a tan foamy head. Not a great deal of head retention, but, what was there stayed around. "
405,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,3.75,"Can @ Monkish. Cloudy golden-orange beer with a finger of soapy white foam. Nice tropical fruits (mostly pineapple), pine, and oily citrus on the nose to start. There’s a bit of underlying sweetness here, but it’s fairly mild. The flavor starts off with a lot of citric hop character such as grapefruit and orange, but there’s a pretty strong pineapple juice thing going on, too. Moderate bitterness and a slightly oily finish. Kind of heavy on the tongue."
406,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.69,"This glass of used motor oil on draft has brown staining legs in spades and a lesser mocha fizz than its un-spiced, un-aged younger brothers. A shit ton of spicy cinnamon melds with wet brown sugar while raisin, black pepper and woody rye boldly accent. That peppercorn actually comes out more this time, contrasting all the powdery cinnamon, smoky charred oak, and sweet dark chocolate covered raspberry that this mother isn't shy to throw at you.  A bit of a sting runs through the smoothly slick, thickly round body that swallows semi-dry and heats the tummy. Is this even better than last year's sleeper hit? I think so. The more pronounced character of peppercorn really enhances the rye presence and adds infinite complexity and depth to a beer that sounds like it might be over the top. This is a hell of an experience. --- At DLD 2019 I had the new version which is the same treatment as the stellar 2018 version, but found it to have a shockingly big explosion of not entirely spicy but dusty cinnamon. On the exhale I still got the total Cinnamon Toast Crunch and brown sugar deliciousness of the past year, but the front end is a little more potent and spicy than past years. It's still one of the better variants, amongst a collection of great brews, but not my favorite this year."
407,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,5.0,"Batch 7 beautiful looking beer, hazed golden straw color, bright white head is dense but fizzes away quickly. aromas are just beautifully enticing and the flavors complimentary. there is a beautifully bright wine charter, lemon zest, mellow funky must quality, lactic, grassy, funky hay character, oak vanilla. just absolutely beautiful, a strong tartness to it. mouthfeel is zippy and crisp. 5++"

409,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.45,"On tap at Fort Point locale.  Hazy pale yellow with short cap of frothy white head.  Passionfruit, red grapefruit, and pineapple are heaviest in the aroma with softer melon notes.  Flavor is a wonderful mix of grapefruit, pineapple, and guava with more resin in the finish than hinted at in the nose. Some more herbal qualities come through in the finish also. Low bitterness.  Feel is soft with low carbonation and medium body.  Stellar beer than lives up to the hype."
410,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.37,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass, not sure when it was bottled and 9.2% ABV. Pours a very attractive slick black with a 2 plus finger dark tan head that leaves thin wisps of lace at near room temperature. Smell is maple, dark chocolate covered coffee beans, vanilla, and a little smoked bacon. Taste follows but more aggressive than the nose. Maple, bacon, vanilla, and coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is a big medium, but slightly creamy, gentle carbonation, a tad dry as it should be, and excellent drinkability. Overall I drank this near room temperature and I think that helped to give it that nice creamy feel, but is just a really good beer, that I would love to have again. Thanks @Ocalafox for this bomber."
411,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.53,2017 vintage enjoyed in the first days of 2019
412,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.54,"Really awesome and complex offering from De Garde. As a member, this beer is one of the ones I most look forward to each and every year. Absolutely worth seeking out."
413,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.94,"I had FIVE of the variants on DLD and this was by far the best. The taste is a mild cinnamon toast crunch with a great balance of the peppercorns. This is a world class stout, very silky. If you can get it, get it."
414,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.77,Pours opaque brown with a small thin champagne like head. Has a chocolate type sour smell. Taste is incredibly well balance. Definitely get the chocolate and the cherry mid palate and finishes with a sour cherry finish. Well done.
415,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.69,Wow just incredible. Pitch black darkest of nights.
416,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.57,"Light orange color with no head. Intense aroma. Tart with stone fruit, lemon, oak, green apple. Apple becomes more pronounced on the taste as it warms. Aggressive oak barrel, tannins, and lactic acid. Grapefruit, lemon. Mouth feel is medium to full. It's a little too acidic to be elite, but this is a fantastic beer. It reminds me of a lot of side project beers because it is so intense and sour."
417,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,3.81,"Flora Plum batch 2 Pours a hazed peach pulp colored beer with a dense, stable head to it. Has a floral barnyard characteristic on the nose, consisting of wet hay, wild flowers, fresh plugged mushrooms, lemon pulp, leather and in this case fruity, sour plums. The plums got an awesomly intriguing appearance on the nose, with a soft stone quality coming through, together with a sweeter note, resulting from the plum skin.  Very silk on the tongue, this provides a soft, acidic driven plum richness from the start till the end, with a pleasant, fruity sweet note cutting through the tartness. Tastes of hay and a stony mineral quality together with a lemony, funky tartness, revealing dust and leather, but also a flowery aspect. Plums get detectable once the initial, pungent tartness dies down by revealing an enjoyable, bright fruit pulp sweetness among prickly lemon and an aqueous softness. Finishes with more lemon, a late plum pulp sweetness and its initial flowery quality. Comes well together with an enjoyable plum presence, bringing quite a few facetts to the foundation of the beer, without dominating the taste. Light bodied, very tart and aqueous during the finish."
418,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.5,"Darkstar November comes all the way from California. This is the 2019 release so it was aged about a year. It is a unique BA stout because it has rye in the mash but aged in Bourbon barrels. Molasses is also added so the result is the spice of rye, the depth of molasses, and the sweetness of bourbon. It all blends together in a thick, syrupy body. Great job by Bottle Logic.  IG: @firesidewithphil"
419,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.25,"On tap - this is the July 2019 batch, so 15 months old. Pours jet black with a super thin tan head around the circumference of the glass. No lacing.  Smell is rum and chocolate upfront, with coffee kicking in just a little bit after. The booze is strong on the nose, but a bit of vanilla is there to balance it.  Taste follows the nose. The booze sting is minimal considering the ABV. Good balance between the sweet vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. The spices and coffee combine for an earthy finish that doesn’t last longer than it should. Feel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. It doesn’t stick much or leave a thick residue on the tongue, which for me sets it apart a bit from other Prairie stouts.  Overall, quite good. I had a tough time assigning numbers to this one, so I looked back through my previous ratings on various stouts, and eventually decided that I had to give this one 4.25 straight through. It’s not the best, but far from the worst, and very consistent across the board."
420,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.51,"This style requires a lot of work for me to like. But Caractere Rouge, I like."
421,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.25,"Revolution is extremely consistent with this brilliant Barleywine that really does the trick. Wonderful nose, great balance and great flavor profile. A big English Barleywine that is not too sweet but has the flavor profile to please. Big beer and good."
422,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.67,"Solid beer Treehouse does right. I find this one to be delightfully citrusy. Classic east coast. Lush in the mouth. Great nose, I would love to try this on tap."
423,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.6,"Deep, dark mahogany poured into a snifter. Very minimal foam that disappears quickly. Smells of leather, molasses, brown sugar, coconut, and dates, hovering over undertones of cured meats and tobacco; the barrel is strong in this one. The flavors are quite rich and decadent, with a cascade of raisins, cocoa, and sherry, followed by a long finish of figs and fudge. There is a tremendous amount of bourbon character, but without being hot or overly boozy; this drinks very smooth and is truly delightful. With seven years of patiently barrel-aged beer involved in the making of Omega Point, I can't wait to see what Olde Hickory will churn out for their 25th anniversary."
424,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.35,"Utter blackness, rich cocoa/tan head, a good 1/2"" sitting pretty on top. In the nose: chili pops out first, coffee next, then cocoa fills in next....sweet, hot, rich, immense. In the mouth: sweetness first, coffee follows, then comes the heat. Nicely integrated hugeness--a calamity of flavors that somehow comes together. More sweet, more chocolate, more coffee, more huge. The chili becomes a little more subdued as the other flavors commingle. Has alcohol arrived yet? Oh, it's only 13%, is it? It's slowly, inevitably becoming apparent. Boom, boom, boom...it's a BOMB! Oh, this is tasty. The chili heat takes a back seat at first, letting the other flavors shine. Tremendous beer, simply amazing. Astonishingly good."
425,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,5.0,Bach 2
426,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.96,"This is the best beer that I've had from Side Project. This one is named Smooth since nectarines don't have peach fuzz, and it is smooth drinking. No chunks of fruit in this beer and it had nice clarity. Well carbonated and new CO2 always kicked up when swirled in the glass. Tons of fruit and musty farmhousey goodness in the nose. Almost like moldy or old fruit in the smell but in the best way possible - the farmhouse was distinct from the fruit. The taste is sour goodness, farmhouse animal jamboree, and fruit. It is weird but you can actually taste that it is nectarines instead of peaches. This is not as in your face sour like most of SP beers which I really liked. Would be easy to drink a few bottles by yourself."
427,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.5,"It looks beautiful with light carbonation remaining after a pour. The smell is a bit muted but you can smell a bit of funk. There's so much happening in the taste. The carbonation is spot on. I don't taste outright cherries but I get the bret. The funk is not incredibly strong, but it's there to keep things interesting. This was bottled 1/25/18 and I wonder how that has affected the taste. It's very smooth, if it weren't so expensive I could drink this all day long. I am glad I have another bottle from my visit and I'm curious how a couple of more years will affect it."
428,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.4,"750ml bottle, of the 2017 release (blue El Catador label). Served in a Cigar City snifter glass. Pours a dark motor oil black body, half finger mocha head, short retention, not much in way of lacing. Big legs on this bad boy. Smell is rich bourbon and chocolate fudge; the bourbon is a smooth and slightly warming presence, oak and charred caramel. Milk chocolate, touch of cinnamon, and touch of cocoa rounds it out. It's a very smooth, well-integrated bourbon barrel on the aroma working with the base beer. Flavour is a bit muddled, however. I get a bit of milk chocolate and a touch of cinnamon up front, with a more astringent and bitter cocoa. Hunahpu's has never been a super cinnamon forward beer, and it shows here. There is mostly milk chocolate, cocoa, and a fair bit of whiskey flavour and heat. A bit of vanillin perhaps thickens up the mouthfeel on the backend some. I do notice a fair bit of extra heat on the backend, that lingers for a little bit after you've finished your sip, a bit of a sting to it. Pretty solid, and the balance is what I remember the base beer to have, except the bourbon adds on an additional dimension. The mouthfeel is heavy and thick-bodied, lower in carbonation but adequate, oily with a bit of whiskey and pepper heat on the finish. A fun beer to finally tick, even if it took until the 2017 release to do so."
429,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.19,2016 ventage. Dark appearance with no head. Aroma is nutty. Taste is also nutty bourbon with a fairly strong sharp alcohol bite. This should be aged longer to eliminate the alcohol taste.
430,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.47,"2019 Vintage - poured into a wine stem at 45°F.  Pours a bright, translucent ruby stone red, with half a finger of pinkish-white head forming, and then immediately settling to a thin collar. Simple, but very pretty. Nose: Soft grainy base, with raw wheat and dusty grain silo, beneath a very bright, vibrant fruit layer. This isn't deep, saturated, sweet grape, but young, fresh, and juicy. Some underlying jammy notes of red currant, blackberry, raspberry, peak through, with a deeper red wine note coming in and out of focus. Some gooseberry, pear, and lemon notes lend brightness and fruity acidity atop a very restrained, young funk presence, with hay, stable, leather, wet oak, petrichor, grass, and topsoil.  Palate: Saint Lamvinus greets the palate with a mildly tart spark, paired perfectly with a thread of sweetness. I believe both the grain *and* the fruit are lending some sugars here. Bright, yet musty grape, with a touch of red berries, abd then the brighter notes emerge, showcasing lemon, gooseberry, white grape, and unripe stone fruit. With this, the tartness increasing, becoming fully dry, with high minerality opening the door for classic Cantillon funk - sea shells, salty air, old wet oak, hay, damp soil, and an almost brie/bloomy rind neutral musty note. Some significant oak tannins emerge, alongside a subtle, tonic-like bitterness. Tartness disappears, finishing with red wine cask, grape skin, and grapefruit pith.  Mouthfeel/Body: This seems to have found its sweet spot, with 7% ABV balancing between enough grain to lend presence, but not enough to advance from the background. Delicate and fluid, but enough body to lend a softness. Effervescence is extremely fine and gentle, but still fairly fizzy. Not puckering - tartness is kept in check, and allows for a progression of dryness. Balanced tannins.  Overall: A delicate, expressive, and definitively Cantillon Cantillon. The grape presence appears simple at first, but unfurls with some subtle but complex depth, pairing with just the right amount of complimentary funk. The subtle suggestion of sweetness is beautiful, and the lambic proceeds with these little ""chapters"" of flavour. Remarkably balanced and approachable, with an elegant simplicity."
431,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.23,"Another home run NE IPA from Trillium. Copper orange and hazy, tropical fruits, piney, citrus on both he nose and the palate. Nicely balanced and extremely quaffable for the abv."
432,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,2.98,"22oz bottle, dripped in wax an' all that, 2018 release, almost 3 years old to the date (short by about 3 weeks). ""Brewed with blackstrap molasses and licorice, cherry bark, vanilla bean, 50% is aged in bourbon, wine, and oak"". Scored this bad-boy pre-aged from the best beer store in the state (shhhh... it was $6) Pours up black, smelling boozy and woody. This is breakfast in my ****ed-up world, cheers! Extremely milk chocolate sweet but the sweetness is thankfully cut by the barrel and spirits. But still, molasses, raisin, mocha coffee dominate. It's drinkable, but HOT, even considering the 11.4%. Other 'competitors' cover up the alc more betterer, but maybe that's the point here. If you are a boozer, you may appreciate this aspect more; me, I'm a beer'er and this is too busy to be beer. I'm a purist in a weird way, and this just has too much going on. The wine and oak don't add anything, it's just all harsh grain alcohol cutting through saccharine dark fruit. Perfectly drinkable, but why?"
433,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.24,"L — 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals a fairly dark black body. Lovely deep brown head that dissipates quite quickly	"
434,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.8,"Pours a cleanse, golden orange with a thin, white head."
435,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.4,"look: pitch black with tiny mocha head smell: authentic peanut butter and chocolate  taste: follows the smell, a little hint of boozy tho feel: heavy, creamy, cloying, full body, the finish is a little too sweet overall: I think this is below the average of treehouse stout (but still better than most of other stouts)"
436,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.47,"Pours a deep burgundy with a ruby pink foamy head. Head retention is good. Aroma is cherries - big and bold. There is a little lactic tartness, but it's smoothed over by the cherry sweetness. Hints of rye bread and earthy malts and hops round it out. Flavor profile is cherry puree. Woah. Hints of lemon, lime, and yeast smooth and balance it out, but the storyline is cherries. Mouth feel is medium with a fuzzy, velvety texture that makes for playful sips. Overall, big cherries with a tightly controlled saison underneath. Really well done. Served from the bottle at Jester King. Reviewed on Beers by BeerAdvocate."
437,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.23,"poured from a 16oz can into a spiegelau IPA glass. pours a clear but darker gold with almost 3 fingers worth of creamy white head. nose is not so much hoppy as it is more sweet honey and an off-smelling maltiness. taste is better with a hoppy and sweet combination paired with a creamy and luscious mouthfeel. it finishes bitter and sweet. overall, pretty solid DIPA that i’ve been wanting to try for quite some time now."
438,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.46,"Viscous and opaque dark brown out of the glass. Prominent chiles and spices on the nose, with faint whiskey and cocoa. Not much coffee. The taste followed closely. Very similar to Bomb! but with an added dimension with the whiskey barrel. To their credit, this did not overwhelm the beer. Full-bodied and smooth on the finish. A nice improvement (hard to believe) to the base beer."
439,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.6,"2018 release from a bomber poured to a snifter. Very thick and opaque, viscous when swirled with a full finger of fluffy, homogeneous head. Quite coconut-forward, smart to toast it before adding in order to match better with the dark and bourbon-forward notes of the base beer. As always, a gorgeous mouthfeel, luxuriously smooth and silky on the tongue."
440,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.27,"a: hazy muted matte orange color with a hint of yellow flat notes. Pours 2 finger fizzy white head that fades as i type s: slight dank earthy sweetness at first. tangerine and dried apricots. orange juice and a hint of orange zest. graperfruit, and loads of dried mango. a hint of pineapple. doughy malt backbone t: lots of dried fruit in here. dried apricots and mango upfront. a kiss of orange zest bitterness behind that. orange juice and some mellow grapefruit bitterness. a touch of chalk at the end m: medium fluffy mouthfeel with low-medium carbonation. classic NEIPA mouthfeel o: really nice NEIPA. it's flavorful, yet mellow. harmonized well and the mouthfeel is absolutely spot-on"
441,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.61,"On tap at Blind Tiger at the New Year's Eve party. This is pretty much a perfect Berliner-style in every way. Tart, but not sour, with a nice, fluffy feel, and so drinkable. An incredible beer all around."
442,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.57,"Poured out as a black color, pretty thick looking with minimal head on it. The smell of the beer is similar to regular Black Tuesday so I'm not picking up much of the rum barrel. The taste is huge, like it's original counter part, there is a subtle spicy notes that could either be the rum notes or possibly just the booze burning a bit. The feel is heavy, rich and silky with some boozy heat on the finish. Overall it was a fun beer to try but not much different than regular Black Tuesday."
443,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.54,"Picture perfect hazy yellow body and pearl white head and lacing. Has plenty of vibrant fruit like the original: grapefruit, lime, nectarine, orange, peach, with accenting lemon with dank and dry hops. Taste adds some mango yet the hops remain pretty dank and full yet finish dry and clean, impressive. Feel is about as good as it gets, hops are more than a one trick dry pony yet finish is bone dry, great hazy fruit, perfectly balanced and crisp. Better than the orignal"
444,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.49,Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Taste is bourbon and nutty. Taste is also a bourbon and nutty with some alcohol aftertaste that is a little thinner that I expected.
445,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.56,"World class, indeed! Beautiful foamy white head, hazy golden pour. Tropical fruit, citrus and pine flavors all vie for attention on your palate. The flavors that unfold do not attack you, they draw you in with understated subtlety."
446,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.59,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like coffee ice cream, cinnamon, caramel, chocolate fudge, sweet coconut, and oak. The cinnamon is done quite well - it's often overdone and turns otherwise good stouts into spicy messes. It's a candied sort of cinnamon flavor, and it twists into the oak flavor for an enjoyable balancing flavor. There's a lot of coffee here, it almost reminds of coffee ice cream or some kind of coffee candy, along with a nice coconut truffle flavor. I don't get much actual bourbon flavor, just oak. This is creamy, with no real booze to it, and a good drinkability. It's pretty decadent stuff. This is definitely one of my favorite Bottle Logic beers yet - it hits a lot of good notes for me."
447,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.34,"$12.94 USD plus tax per 4-pack of 16 fl oz pull-tab cans at a beer store in Colorado. Currently ranked #4 in the Top Pale Ale - American beers list and #7 in the Top Iowa beers list with a perfect overall score of 100/100. 40 IBUs. Hopped with Citra. 5.8% ABV. Best by 06/01/21 per bottom of can. Served cold into a Rastal Craft Master glass. HEAD: ~6-7cm in height. Frothy off white colour. Could be creamier and still more robust, but it lasts a good ~8 minutes. BODY: Pulpy in appearance. Looks like unfiltered orange juice. Murky, hazy, and obviously unfiltered. Orange in colour. Appears well carbonated. Looks very nice...certainly an appealing pale ale appearance-wise. AROMA: Bursts with fresh citrus, orange juice, overripe mango peel, orange creamsicle...yeah, this is citrusy as can be, and I'm digging it. Promises a juicy pale ale that showcases Citra hops to their fullest...I'm eager to try it. Aromatic intensity is high for a pale ale. TASTE & TEXTURE: Has citric acidity, which helps set off its citrus-forward hop profile. Delivers stupidly well on its Citra hopping regimen, showcasing the hop impeccably - and impressively intensely given the beer's scant 5.8% ABV. Orange juice, orange creamsicle, mango peel, orange juice, alpha acids, pulp, and more subdied scintillae of passionfruit & mango. Smooth, soft, wet, medium-bodied, juicy, refreshing, fresh, pulpy, and perfectly carbonated. Impeccably balanced with a very focused citrusy hop profile that emphasizes Citra to the fullest potential of the hop varietal. Depth of hop flavour is all but unrivaled in the pale ale category (Zombie Dust may be an exception if you'll allow that that's a pale ale). Incredibly well built for a pale ale, rivaling many IPAs that use Citra in its commitment to the varietal. OVERALL: Not since Kern River's Citra have I observed Citra hops utilized so incredibly well. Easily one of the best pale ales on the market for my money (whether we're talking just the U.S., or, hell, globally), and one I intend to revisit frequently. It's hard to imagine it much better. This is everything I want in a Citra-hopped pale ale. Bravo, Toppling Goliath. A / OUTSTANDING"
448,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.26,"B2, Had this side by side with 30 other tremendous apricot sours and saisons. It was a damn good beer but i liked La Fosse better and Westly. Maybe it was more apricotty fresh but it was tart and good, but didn't blow me out of the water either."
449,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.49,"About time to leave a review on this favorite. Draught pour in Columbus OH. Brassy gold color with a one finger head. Faded quickly, but left hints of lacy foam down the sides of the shaker pint. Orange, grapefruit, and something toasty on the nose. Little bit of hay as well. On the swallow i get more pink grapefruit, hint of blueberry, backed with clean, crisp malt body to provide medium mouth feel. Carbonation on this draught is properly regulated. Subtle caramel comes out as the glass warms in the 95° heat. Guess this is what we call hoppy pale ale these days; would have been (and satisfies my need for) ipa in the yesterdays"
450,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.49,"Jet black with a two finger head, cinnamon is certainly present along with cacao and a little vanilla. I get the touch of heat but booze as well. The two together make this complex but a too much so, it doesn't jive for me the way other Jackie's do, but it is still quite drinkable and so I will."
451,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.56,"Appearance - Pours slightly dull opaque yellow with a dense white head. Strings of lacing around the glass. Aroma - Aroma leans to a slightly sweet citrus with a nice grain aroma. Mild mango light tangerine, mild dank weed aroma, not much bitterness. Taste - Ripe mango, citrus peel, the New Zealand hops are prominent. Nice earthy taste mild floral flavor, great ripe citrus flavors. Feel - medium bodied soft pretty dry finish.  Overall - Really well done IPA, really earthy easy drinking."
452,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.65,"Very good head production, and good retention. Body is a deep, dark hue, close to ebony. Absolutely huge nose, swarming with tones of chocolate and vanilla (and I'm not even sure chocolate is added to this beer). Bourbon is fairly restrained, but adds a nicely sweet mash. No real coffee note. Deep and rich malt base. Similarly thick, rich, and sweet on the palate, but with plenty of bourbon and oak, lasting all the way through the finish with some boozy heat. Absolutely delicious, with a crazy amount of vanilla, rich chocolate and brown sugar tones, and plenty of coffee, all wrapped in a warm, lush blanket of bourbon. The boozy heat announces the high ABV, but it's incredibly smooth, thick, and drinkable."
453,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.62,"L: Cloudy yellow with a thick creamy head and excellent lacing. S: Very juicy blend of peach, mango, pineapple, and a touch of spruce. Subtle malt, but there is a faint, sweet breadiness. T: Juicy mango and pineapple abound, a bit of herbal green character, very soft bitterness, and a nice, light candied malt character. F: Lush, creamy, tongue coating, and a dry finish. Overall:. Such an incredible drinking experience, the very best of the New England IPA style."
454,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.16,"A great looking IPA, nice clear orange with decent head. Smells of tropical fruit, grapefruit dank but a bit muted. Taste follows. Not sure if they sent a fresh keg to Shelton Festival, will have to revisit out west. But this fell short of they hype for me."
455,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.5,"Super intense raspberries on the nose and taste. Just explodes all over the palate. As if the raspberries weren't enough, the carbonation is lively and the prickly sensation is like pop rocks candy on the tongue. Maybe get some subtle hints of lemon and oak, but the sour raspberry jam overwhelms everything else. This was quite the experience, but wouldn't want to drink a lot of it."
456,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.2,"Can from ABV.  Jet black with a dark brown head with excellent retention and lacing, this looks great! The nose is rich and punchy, a blend of bourbon heat, soy, dark chocolate, bitter coffee, a touch of vanilla and a definite booze note. A savory/meaty/mushroomy note is present on the nose, rich in umami.  The palate opens roasty, bitter, moderately boozy with a little vanilla, lots of dark chocolate. Soy, savory, mushroom, barrel, black patent pungent bitterness and mild earthiness. Heavy toasted oak with some vanilla, minimal coconut. Dark fruit on the finish with some dates and dark Thompson raisins. Medium full in body, softly carbonated, long, boozy and savory finish. Quite excellent."
457,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.48,"Pours clear mahogany with purple glints and a crackly head that lasts a long while. Berries and a complex matrix of funky, tart flavours in the aroma. Lots of sourness and barnyard notes in the first sip. Pineapple juice in there too. Sweet berry notes add excellent balance but things are still bone dry overall. The 10% abv is shockingly well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with prickly, champagne like carbonation. A stellar wild ale from the OG producer. Complex, nuanced yet still dangerously quaffable. A must try."
458,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.99,"I gave it a 5, a 5, a F'n 5. But my friend rated it: ""4.8, and I still got wood."" So we settled in the middle and gave it a 4.9. I just hope you don't spend all night with this beer only to ruin Coach Kilmer's perfect season the next day. SR-71 may have been the back up plan to Assassin, but it doesn't want your life."
459,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,3.75,"Canned 10/3/19. Purchased 10/5/19. Consumed 10/6/19, 10/8/19, 10/12/19, 10/20/19?, 10/28/19?, 11/11/19 I've never looked more forward to a beer and I've never been so disappointed in a beer. I had a friend in school near NE Brewing for 3 years but he was never able to get any to bring back home. I've been to the brewery, tried some of their other beers, liked most (some a lot) and bought a growler of one of their beers home. I was just never able to get Fuzzy, so when I finally got it, I was excited.  It didnt deliver.  I poured it into a standard clean pint glass every time. It looks fine, not too hazy, a little amber for NE style but fine. It did have a nice head. I drank it at 38, 43, 48, 53 degrees and above. I drank it before during and after food. I drank it as my fist beer in all but one occasion. I drank it several times with 3 beer friends (one serves part time at a brewery) of different ages who really know beer, mostly IPA's but stouts and sours too. I drank it 3 days old and several times over 5 weeks hoping for something more.  It's not very juicy. It's not very dank. Hop presence is decent but I prefer more evidence of dry hopping. It's a fine beer, a decent IPA, sort of old school style, something I might grab off the store shelf that had been sitting in the store for a few months but not something I'd wait in line for. I don't get the 4.5 (99) and the 44th best IPA anywhere.  I've had several IPA's from both Tree House and Alchemist and a lot of different IPA's from Aslin and Veil in VA and this just isn't in the same class as most of those beers and I am speaking specifically of beers in the 6-7% range to be fair."
460,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.38,"A bright amber orangeish, minimal head quickly dissipates. Aroma is very hoppy, as expected, citrusy and faint floral notes. Taste is a bitter but smooth with the malt present with a slight honey taste provide a pleasing experience. Mouthfeel is tingling and coating smooth. This is a fine effort by the Bell’s brew meisters, enjoy."
461,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.53,"Black in color. No head. All the flavors of Black Tuesday, but more rounded out and mellow. Tons of bourbon and fudgy chocolate. Rich. Caramel. Very dessert like. Oak and vanilla. A very big beer.  Much better than bt. This one is very drinkable."
462,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.59,"poured from a 750mL growler into a snifter. pours a semi hazy orange with frothy white head. lacing remains throughout the pour. smell is subtly fruity with a fairly strong butter hop aroma. it’s floral, bitter and fruity all at the same time. taste is dominantly bitter. almost west coast style bitterness but it finishes with more well rounded and balanced fruity finish. mouthfeel is extremely thick, soft and very pleasant on the tongue. might be the highlight of this pour or at least what ties this beer together. very glad to have tried this. very well made IIPA with attributes of both west and east coasts all tied together with HF’s best traits."
463,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.28,"From the can (IPA Fest in Cyberspace Provided), it pours a clear yellow golden color with a nice white head that remains for a long time. In the nose, it is citrus, mostly pineapple, and is enjoyable. In the mouth, it is the same, with a solid malt base. Very nice brew!"
464,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.66,"This bottle came to me by way of a BIF - I don't know exactly which batch it is, but the fruit is still rich and deeply present. The apricot notes are super ripe and pulpy. It's very sour, almost cheek-puckering. The fruit is still predominant, though the sourness is very forward. The pour is a lovely, light gold-yellow. It's just slightly transparent, more than you might expect of a saison. Killer beer - it's tremendous. Thank you to my sender!"
465,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.54,"Appearance: Poured jet black and thick with a very rich luscious brown head.  Smell: almost like a chocolate chip cookie. Very rich malted chocolate with tones of maple, and black coffee. Very heavy and quite sweet.  Taste: very sweet and robust with milk chocolate, light maple and black coffee. Each serving its own entity yet coming together forming a desert. Not one adjunct overwhelmed the other. Just perfectly balanced.  Mouthfeel: quite rich and full bodied. Very smooth. Quite impressive for a 7.7% abv. Overall: With all the added ingredients, TH did exceptional working keeping this balanced and not too sweet. It was an easy to drink and enjoyable beer!"
466,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,5.0,"750ml poured into a teku at 2017 KBBS share in Lincoln, Nebraska. Appearance - Burgandy. Smell - Funky cherry pie! Taste - Funky cherry juice. Mind-blowing good! Mouthfeel - Medium to full body. Medium carb. Very nice! Overall - Highly Recommended...  Grade (A+) DEFINITELY BELONGS ON THE TOP 250..."
467,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.1,"Poured from a 12.7 oz bottle into a Jackie O's tulip glass. Acquired in a trade. 2015 bottle.  Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a two finger brown head that reduces slowly to leave a ring of foam and little lacing.  Aromas are heavy on the bourbon, cocoa and light vanilla, dark- bittersweet chocolate, lightly roasty with coffee aromas. Not getting much maple on the aroma.  On the tongue is dark chocolate and bourbon, roasty malt, marshmallow, caramel, sweet vanilla, chocolate cookies. A slight oxidized off flavor included. Mouthfeel is kinda thin with medium-low carbonation. Overall decent. For a bourbon barrel aged stout, this is on point, but I didn't get any maple whatsoever in the taste or aromas, so I have to give it a 3.75 final rating because it wasn't as advertised."
468,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.71,Very nice pour into a tegu glass. Cloudy orange hue with moderate lacing that comes off a nice tight bubbled head. Some nose notes of both tropical fruits and citrus fruits. There is some soft baked bread and oat notes that come through as well. The palate brings the resin pine hop notes forward to meet up with the fruits. the tropical fruits more prominent than the stone on the flavor profile particularly some grilled pineapple. The ale finishes beautifully with a richness on the mouth and a good bite of bitterness. Revisited this Oct ‘21 and appreciated it even more.
469,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.06,"L: bright yellow/orange. Attractive S: slightly earthy and very fruity, nectarine skin and peach flesh and orange juice.  T: had Fresh on draft the day it was canned, picked up a lot of hop burn and bitterness, almost An unenjoyable amount. 3 weeks later, the can I’m enjoying still exhibits sharp bitterness and not much else. There is zero subtly here, and yes I know the point is to scale things “way up”, but this literally hits just one hop-burn note. Disappointing for sure F: more balanced than some recent trillium offerings, not as sticky sweet with this one O: ehhh, not worth the hype at all, like so much of what trillium offers nowadays"
470,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.73,"This stout blew my mind at my first sip sometime ago. For whatever reason I am preferring stouts, porters, red ales and bocks over IPAs which were my preferred brew for a long time."
471,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.29,"Both last snow and this in the same year, neat! Jet black body with a brown head, standard but well done. Huge coconut right away in the nose, bourbon is present but light, get bakers chocolate and caramel more. Taste is surprisingly similar, while coconut laden nose is fun, want more barrel for the taste. Malt work stabilizes the complexion though, with velvet smooth coffee setting in near the finish. The feel is very smooth, but it is light in both body and barrel, coconut defines somehow even more than LS. Like last snow better, but still a nice porter. Coconut fans this one is for you!"
472,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.81,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a oversized wine glass. Thank you Ryan for sharing this! Pours a sunshine golden hazy body, this is literally glowing. Small white head. Beautiful beer. God damn that is thick on the last pour. Oh my god, straight fruit purée. On the nose.. straight stone fruit, pulp to the nasal, like someone just crushed a bunch of nectarines and peaches and the aromas are wafting in my general direction. On the tongue is straigh stone fruit pulp, sour peaches, orange juice and nectarine pulp goodness. Thick and juicy. God damn this is amazing. One of the best sours I've ever tasted. This was perfect on every account."

475,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.54,"End of the semester celebration! Gorgeous deep, dark purple color with a violet initial head and nice lacing. Fragrant raspberry smell with some dank funk. Tart raspberries, earthy funk, oak, lemon, pepper. Herbal and grassy background. A very fun beer!"
476,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.98,2019 Vintage
477,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,3.93,"On tap @ Bottle Logic. Black in color with a thin layer of tan foam. Smells like fresh brownies and fudge. Plenty of vanilla, some whiskey, and oak. Lots of brown sugar as well. Slightly boozy as well. The flavor is big on brownie batter, cookie dough, and graham cracker. Spicy whiskey, some fudge, and a touch of booze. Lots of hazelnut, vanilla, and caramel as well. Light coffee and roasted malts. Pretty solid, though not something I could crush a whole lot of."
478,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.47,"Can dated 8/20/20 into pint glass. Pours a hazy gold with a 2-finger off-white head. Great lacing. Initial impression is mango, grapefruit, and a touch of pine resin. Mouthfeel is medium and verging on sticky. Finish is clean and bittersweet. My new favorite beer from Toppling Goliath!"
479,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.17,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter.  Appearance - Hazy and murky red body. Did not gush! Small white head. Medium collar. Smell - Juicy cherry. Acidic, but the cherry has a sweet pie aroma. Characteristic Lost Abbey sour aroma. Not quite acetic, but intense and woody. Taste - Cherry is just like the aroma, hints of cherry pie but not that sweet. Woody. Has some vinegar sourness to it.  Mouthfeel - High carbonation. Moderate sourness, not so intense, especially for a Lost Abbey beer. Overall - This still doesn't compare to the complexity of a lambic, but it's very good. Nowhere near worth what it takes to get, though."
480,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.9,"2019 Vintage. Black color. Tan head. Thick. This is decadent! Fudge chocolate cake. BlackBerry. All the nilla. All the bourbon. Oaky. Rich, desserty. Faint roast. Perfect. Full bodied. Thick and rich. Absolutely amazing bottle."
481,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.15,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned July 30th 2018. Frothy and sudsy off white tall reaching nearly four finger tall head. Slight swiss cheese bubbles in its makeup, and a slow dissolve. Mild turbid body, a bit brown dull with a hint of lifeless sense to it and dull lemon yellow as well. Faint soapy cling to the glass. Aroma is dank earth and a soft sense of malt. Hints in the weedy range quite easily but is rather one dimensional but a good simple one. Palate is fairly tasty but not breaking any major ground. Juiced nicely but stays away from tropical or citrus and some how makes a nice earthy levitation. Rich amounts of dank and almost weedy/woody smoke like flavor. Controled nicely, and within a very good abv range that is right in the perfect spot for consumption. A good touch of light white sugar malt on the finish, but dusts light sweetness for a contrast, but also not much roaring bitterness either. Very unique dank angle, almost dank rich and I want to say tropical but without the fruitiness which is nice. There's an interesting chewy component to this as well, but strangely this is a brew I would think seems like another dank take that isn't really that groundbreaking or mindblowing. However, there is much great balance and zoned in that it rates overall very highly. Quite and odd duck I must say."
482,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.31,"L - 1.5 finger cig-stain yellow head atop a translucent dark purple body. S - oh boy. Dark fruits, raisin, booze, brown sugar. T - tons of dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar, raisins, caramel, and bourbon booze. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Moderate booziness. F - medium body and carb. O - an ass-kicker, this is."

On palate is spice, plum, dark chocolate covered cherries, oak, sticky sweetness hinting at maple, dark roastyness, mellow vanilla and caramel, not a huge spirit quality but some mellow bourbon flavor in there to compliment the barrel notes, very rich and thick mouthfeel throughout."

487,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.5,"Can a playa be blunt? Off the f-ing hook. Like Captain Hook on acid, this one is bat sh-t wild! Heavy, I mean heavy! (Like Oprah) but oh so smooth like Barbara Palvin in a 2 piece. I mean ay fu-king ay! Yes!"
488,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.66,The original is still one of the best TreeHouse has to offer. The balance between hops and juiciness is top rate. Will always be my favorite TreeHouse beer.
489,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.25,2009 sticker opened 1/29/2017. Loads of lime on the nose. Some hints of apple and oak. Green grapes in the flavor with some oakiness. Very wine like. The body is a tad thin bordering on watery.
490,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,3.84,"Canned 10/27/16; drank 11/5/16 @ the Yarchives.  Opaque light orange appearance.  Huge, fluffy white head; thick, frothy lace.  Mango, mint & fresh ganja notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Prickly grapefruit & honey flavors up front; mild mint notes on the finish.  Interesting & refreshing, but not revelatory."
491,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.49,"Received from a friend in exchange for a collection of Equilibrium DIPAs/TIPAs... L: beautiful, rich golden maize color with a 3/4"" of thick head that dissipated after a few minutes. Somewhat opaque, owing to the unfiltered packaging."

493,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.25,"Rerate, 330 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10%. Dark brown colour, huge off-white to beige head. Aroma and flavour mainly as the first time, but I drank the beer a little colder now, and the sweetness was not overwhelming. I’m upping it a couple points. Original rating: 330 ml capped bottle. I had trouble getting the very hard cap off (no proper opener at hand), and 1/4 of the beer was driven out by the carbonation before I succeeded. Drank it at temp. appr. 14 degrees C. Beer was murky brown with floaties, large tan head. Aroma was malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates, chocolate and cedarwood. Flavour was again malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates and chocolate. No detectable bitterness. A complex beer, but too sweet to be ""perfect"" IMO."
494,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.6,"Big fizzy foamy head, good lacing, semi clean tan orange Nose loads of awesome gueuze, good funk, tart, little fruit like, barnyard grassy hay Taste more of the same funk, grassy barnyard funk, hay, little fruity like, just a great gueuze blend Mouth is med bod, tons of carb"
495,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.0,"16oz can poured into a snifter. A: Amber in color with a very opaque haze. Persistent white head retains at a couple fingers. Plenty of sticky lacing. S: Puréed mango, apricot, peach, white grapefruit, green grass clippings, maybe even a hint of strawberry. Doughy, almost nougaty malt base. Hint of toasted grain too. T: Follows the nose. Plenty of puréed mango and apricot up front. Peach and white grapefruit bloom shortly thereafter. Plenty of oily and “green” hop flavor too. Freshly cut grass, hemp seed, very slight brush of pine bark, suggestion of sweet onion. The earthy tones take a back seat to the fruit though. Bitterness is extremely mild. Doughy malt base with a slight hint of toast. Soft finish sees the mango and apricot return and slowly fade away. M: Medium-Full body. Round, fluffy, and slightly chewy/weighty. Mildly gripping astringency and a very slight sense of hop burn, though not enough to be a turn off. Carbonation prickles gently at the tip of the tongue. O: This feels as though it’s been pushed to the brink. There’s some mild hop burn creeping in, but overall I’m surprised at how tame it is given the purported hopping rates. There isn’t much at all in the way of bitterness, and it mostly maintains its softness. I have to say that I like doppelgänger better, though, as that beer feels sharper and more in focus in terms of the hop profile. This one has a toe over the line, and any further and I think we’d start to get into unpleasant territory. More isn’t always better."
496,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.56,"Amazing BBA maple coffee stout. Much better than CBS, not even close. Big Maple flavor with viscous mouthfeel. Very well balanced. Looking forward to this years version"
497,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.67,So much going on here. You still get the Chile spice with the chocolate and cinnamon. Coffee is not overpowering and adds another well balanced element. Excellent.

499,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.8,Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a huge creamy head. 
500,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.71,"Not sure why people are down on Fremont, every single beer I have had from them has been incredible, this one is no exception. Extremely dark brown with a tan collar. Cinnamon and coffee (shocker) lead the aromas of bourbon, oak, cocoa, vanilla, coconut, brown sugar and dark fruit, kind of get a boozy gourmet french toast complexion, amazing. Taste is a touch heavier, with the cinnamon coming in powerfully right away. Leather and other holiday spices are thrown in with everything from the taste, melds together so amazing while have contrasting flavors to build on. Feel is chewy, full, smooth, with good spice, barrel, and coffee textures. Amazing, but for a strong ale it is almost too well put together, give it a touch more bite but I am nitpicking. The wife liked it Again Note: Ages very well, coffee settles in without losing cinnamon and booze warmth. Slight preference to fresh over aged, but world class either way"
501,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.27,"Served from the bottle in a Mickey Finn's shaker pint glass. I like fudge. I like KBS. Let's do this. This stuff pours a lithe obsidian topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises rich chocolate syrup, mild charred barrel, vanilla bean, and a waft of roasted malts. Lovely. The taste tones the chocolate down to add some balancing roast and some coffee; more barrel comes through here, as does an influx of bourbon and a background twinge of maple syrup. The combination is a touch discombobulated, but ultimately it's a rather pleasing mixture. The body is a healthy medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an easy-going feel. Overall, a very tasty stout, potentially one that doesn't quite live up to its stated pedigree, but one that I will never think of turning down. Good times."
502,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.54,"Poured from a 750 ml bomber into a tulip glass.  Look: Lighter, old gold body with a beautiful off-white head that is retained throughout drinking.  Smell: Upon opening, intense smells of old, wet barnyard hay. Like crazy. Borderline off putting but as it opens it smells crisp and lemony. Fresh cut, post rain fescue grass.  Taste: Lime pith, grapefruit rind. Lemon candy, some sour funky hay on the back end. slightly herbal after taste--like chives or some kind of subtle herb.  Feel: The pronounced head gives it a smooth finish against the intense carbonation--it's almost buttery but in the most inviting way that makes you want to take another sip.  This is an amazing beer from 3F. I imagine it'd taste a lot differently sans carbonation as it ages, and I'd be very interested to try one in 5 years or so--I'm def going to buy another one of these and stash it in my cellar for the long haul. Awesome beer."
503,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,5.0,"Poured into a 16 Snulip glass not sure when it was canned but I trust my source. Pours a hazy yellow with a 2 finger sticky white head that leaves webs of lace as it slowly settles. 5 Smell is guava, pineapple, tangerine, cantaloupe, and apricot amazing. 5 Taste follows guava, pineapple, tangerine, ripe melon, and apricot sublime! 5 Mouthfeel is bigger than most, soft gentle carbonation, sticky not dry, and at 7.2% drinks more like 8% but so darn drinkable. 5 Overall some never give a perfect score and I don’t hand them out often, but when I can’t think of a single thing I would change I do. Beer is perfect for me. Thanks @tasterschoice for this treat. 5"
504,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.56,Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Captain Lawrence custom tasting pint glass; canned on 4/16/19.
505,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.53,"look: just black thing  smell: shrimp and soy sauce, a little smoke chocolate and coffee taste: soy sauce, vanilla, bitter chocolate coffee,  feel: smooth but very strong and punchy overall: a good booze, for the big days, cheers!"
506,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,3.99,"1-2 month old can poured into a tulip. Fully opaque, almost apple cider coloring, but I wouldn't really call it ""hazy"" by modern definition. Fluffy initial eggshell head with a couple sips' worth of retention and some nice, sticky, splotchy lacing. Almost looks like a saison. Definitely clean and crisp looking. Perhaps this is a more traditional Vermont hazy? Aroma profile is a nice blend of coasts, with tons of semi-sweet fruit juice but a nice blast of bitter, pithy citrus and pine resin. There's a dank, almost funkiness in the mix -- started as an almost sweaty gym socks aroma but gradually became more overripe fruity. It may sound strange, but I like it, whatever it is -- adds a nice degree of complexity to the hybrid IIPA base. Berries, tangerine, tropical fruit, stone fruit, grapefruit, pineapple -- it's a great fruit salad, but none of it is overly bold or potent. Just a pleasant and mouthwatering smeller. Taste initially follows pretty closely, but this one is much drier than I expected. Citrus, tropical fruit, grapes, and berries up front, then a huge blast of grapefruit pith and lemon rind. Good piney twang with a big mineral note. I keep waiting for some residual sweetness to flow in, but it simply never does. This one has (un-sugared) grapefruit all over it. Extremely drinkable and well made, but note very layered or nuanced. The dryness and grapefruit definitely remind me of Alchemist IPAs, but this one isn't quite of the same quality. Soft and silky like a modern, murky hazy, with a nice bite of carbonation along with the pithy twang. Coats the teeth and tongue really well, with the pine resin coming back to the forefront."

508,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.49,"Brownish black with two fingers of brown foam. Smell and taste are clones: huge maple syrup from the local diner with coffee bean, mild chocolate, brown sugar and molasses. Reminds me a lot of Mikerphone's imperial SLBS extra maple variants. Feel is lighter and not syrupy at all though, roasted and malty if anything, amazing given the huge maple presence. Would love to try this in a barrel! A classic that is worth the hype for a great maple fix without saturating the palate with sweetness"
509,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.48,"L:. Pours a bright ruby red with a small pinkish head and no lacing, very pretty beer. S:. Lots of jammy sweet cherry, cinnamon, and oak, with a tart cherry lingering in the background. T:. Jammy cherry comes first followed by cinnamon cobbler crust, and then a quite dry tart cherry to contrast and balance it out. F:. Dry and lower carbonation. O:. I love the interplay between the two different cherries."
510,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.46,"08/2016 - While I enjoy the base beer, the Galaxy usage is top notch in my opinion. That said, the honey does a nice job balancing the Galaxy; tasty, refreshing, and super flavorful."
511,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.4,Opening the can unleashes a plethora of tropical hop notes. She drinks incredibly smooth. A fantastic siping beer. A little darker and less hazy than a typical NEIPA. One of the pioneering “juice” beers from Vermont. Sip of Sunshine is a delectable beer. A good change from the super hazy beers but still incredible NEIPA flavor.
512,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.75,2014 Vintage
513,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,5.0,"Pouted from a 750 mL bottle. The color is very pretty dark red hazy color. The aroma is a bit of funk with a big explosion of raspberry, love it. The taste follows the smell with the typical SP acidity and a big raspberry flavor, super jammy. Its an awesome beer and tasty nonetheless."
514,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.73,"Poured from bottle into Tulip at Toronado San Diego. Appearance: Pours a bright hazy red/orangeish color with about a fingers width of a light pink head that dissipates there after leaving by some thin lacing along the glass.  Smell: Aroma is loaded with tons of fresh ripe/sour cherries with some faint citrus and a very mild vanilla tinge. Taste: Powerful dose of fresh, ripe, sour cherries illicit a mild sweetness as well. Initially the sourness is right from the start, and grows in intensity as the beer warms, followed very briefly by a ripe sweet cherry flavor that finishes right back to a dry mellow sour cherry tartness with some oak. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium-high carbonation that sips perfectly. Overall: Another fantastic sour (Kriek) by The Lost Abbey. This was a great move to go to the kriek style for 2011. Could not have asked for any better. One of the best krieks I have had and if you are ever at Toronado SD I suggest you grab one before this rarity disappears for ever."
515,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.4,"Pours a light grapefruit color, gentle haze throughout. Nice foamy head that lingers. Big citrus bomb. Load of grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, orange, some grassiness. Taste follows nose: sweet pineapple, grapefruit pith, lemon zest, fresh squeezed Valencia orange juice. Wow. Very nice. Carbonation is on point. Overall this is a very enjoyable DIPA. Not too heavy, not very malty, NE style, VERY juicy, not dank. Outstanding. 3/19/18"
516,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.32,"Quite possibly the best Funky Buddha I have had, by far... Right out of the glass it pours almost syrupy thick, what ends up in the pint is black with a thick tan-colored foam. That foam was something to look at - never have I witnessed a creamy-looking foam - this was creamy unlike anything else I have ever seen. The scent was reminiscent to sweet Cuban coffee with even the same soft touch of bitterness - truly exceptional. Mouthfeel was carbonated but creamy, no dry finish to this drink. The taste made me think it would be boozy, maybe it should have been, but at 6.4% ABV it's almost sessionable. This is frankly a very good beer, one that I didn't think much from the label art, but as they say, never judge a beer by it's bottle or can or its label art..."
517,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.96,"2017 vintage drank on 14 May 17, bottled in February i believe. was delicious, cocoa, vanilla, slightly smokey, sweet bourbon, and oak. the base stout is great but this exceeded expectations. i have another one aging, can't wait to try it after the year mark."
518,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.66,"Pours a mahogany brown with a tan head and excellent retention. Aroma is bread, molasses, dried fruit. The front end of the palette is reminiscent of yeasty whole grain bread followed by hints of molasses and warm spices. It finishes slightly bitter with hints of raisin and a touch of booziness. Mouthfeel is full with light carbonation. Overall, an outstanding example of Belgian brewing."
519,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.3,"Slightly hazed golden orange with big bubbles and an insubstantial head, but points earned for good flocculation – no yeasty chunks even though I poured this like an idiot. All the gunk stayed safely compacted at the bottom of the bottle. Aroma is predominantly Band-Aid-ish phenols, some sweet, fresh nectarine, and a delightful apricot kernel/almond note with hints of creamy vanilla to round it out; overall it comes across as a farmyard funked-up peach melba. Tastes much the same, too, but more sour and less funky than anticipated. The 'whole fruit' flavour of the nectarines is amazing, almost like biting into the fresh fruit itself. Quite sour and quite fizzy; a smoother, softer mouthfeel would help carry the fleshy flavour of the fruit better, I think. But overall this is a remarkable fruit beer; the nectarine flavour keeps giving and giving."
520,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,5.0,"Pours a thick, gooey brown and smells of figs, dark fruits, and caramel. This is the best tasting barleywine I have ever had. Rich, thick, oily, all of the dark fruits and smooth bourbon finish. WOW JUST WOW!!"
521,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.58,"This barrel aged imperial stout, is rich, smooth, medium-full bodied. Cherry, licorice, maple, coffee notes throughout. Just tried it last week for the first time here in Florida. Had six 22 oz bottles shipped to me. I am not disappointed."
522,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.54,"Pours so dark it is completely impervious to light. 2 fingers of mocha head slowly fade. Really great chocolate and bourbon aroma, fairly typical yet exceptional. Great chocolate flavor, very intense, bourbon barrel smooths it out and gives it a really nice barrel flavor. Tons of dark roasted malt flavor. Light bitter espresso finish. Full bodied, rich, thick, and creamy. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall an outstanding BBA Imperial Stout, worth buying a few if you come across it. 5/4/19"
523,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.62,"Pours essentially like a wine - deep purple, no head, very mild carbonation. Aroma is predominantly a gentle, dry red wine tannin with notes of wet oak, macerated dark cherries & some very subtle bourbon caramel that adds depth. The notes were right on but I felt it could have been a bit more expressive.  Taste begins with a tingling, tart cordial cherry that quite delicious - more oak tannin & earthy dark grape skin provide more of that wine flavor. The bourbon is subtle and borderline elusive, but it is there and adds a soft boozey heat. It isn’t over-tart like so many sours, and offers a few layers. Excellent."
524,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.81,"What's not to like here? Pours a burgundy with a finger of pink head. Smell is fresh, sweet yet slightly tart raspberry. A hint of oak."
525,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.32,"This one is hazy yellow with an orange tinge, lots of carbonation and topped with two fingers of off-white head.  The smell is a lemon and vinegar apple cider vinegar, Barrel, and macaroni, like cellar in Belgium with some yellow plum on the nose.  The taste is fantastic! Sour but it is extremely smooth and delicious. It carries the hints that were on the nose but it’s very light and dances on the pallet.  It’s got moderate carbonation, very tart, with a very light melt mouth feel.  I got this at Torinado pub in San Francisco on Aug 25th, 2020 where I’m drinking it in my hotel in San Bruno near San Francisco Airport."
526,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.44,"2/18/15 vintage L - pours a dark paint brown with a beautiful mocha head. Mesmerizing honeycomb bubble structure. This'll do just fine in lieu of morning coffee on this north east blizzard morning.  S - huge roasty lactose character bolstered by the booze. Iced latte and a walnut nuttiness. Almost has a bit of tang to it.  T - drinks like iced coffee too! Sweet cream and more than a few sugars in this roast. There is some fresh, minty hoppiness present that tips this into ""refreshment"" territory. Mellow oak rounds out this wonderfully balanced beer.  F - soft and supple. Not motor oil like you'd expect for a 12% stout, but luscious and creamy.  O - all around great stout. Well orchestrated. Judging by some of the reviews (and what's written on the bottle) this gets better with time. Two years and not a trace of booze burn. Coffee wasn't as pronounced as I expected and the sweeter flavors started to come out, but everything seems soothing and under control. Oak character definitely seems more robust but I'll have to try another fresh to see what's what."
527,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.75,Very hazy bright yellow body with a beautiful thick white head.
528,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.5,"Drank on 8/6/2019 - traveling hotel beer. Classy plastic glass at the Holiday Inn. Lots of mango, a bit pithy. Both juicy and resinous AND lightly bitter. Good one. I like this a lot. Beautiful hazy pour with tons of mouth feel."
529,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.65,"Like liquid hop candy, yet with a basic enough malt base to never veer off into syrupy sweet territory. Arguably the best beer Alpine puts out, and that's saying something."
530,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.63,"I feel like this was destiny. In Columbus for a drive-in concert during This pandemic we picked up some pizza and then hit a nearby grocery store for some drinks. I tried to find the freshest IPA that I could find and what do you know, they had one six pack of Bohdi cans in the cooler that was less than a month old. I wasn’t looking for a Dipa but couldn’t pass this up. Glad I didn’t because this beer is fantastic. So easy to drink. Love the scent and great mouth feel. I enjoyed at the concert and had a few left over that I have enjoyed even more. Not a hazy or NEIPA - this is a classic IPA with great hop feel. Some Malt taste but predominantly citrus. It will sneak up on you because it is so easy to drink. Love this beer. Love the 12 oz cans and will definitely be looking for more Wish I could find this closer to home"
531,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.34,Pours with decent light head and color. Sniffs with a faint smoke like caramel. Fells full body on the tongue and excellent taper off flavor for the pallet. Very drinkable.
532,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.75,"Pours a jet black. Aroma is wonderful mix of bourbon, maple, coffee & caramel. Very pleasant. I lingered over the smell much more than usual. The taste was equally pleasing and quite complex. It comes at you in waves. Starting with the sweet maple with brown sugar, caramel & chocolate, and then shifting to a more roasted flavor to go with the coffee. All the while a constant bourbon flavor. Simply awesome. Medium to full body."
533,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.44,Smells wonderful! It’s truly a fine Belgium inspired brew that any fine monk would enjoy. Amazing how the taste of the Pinot noir enhances the taste buds when I am usually adverse to wine alone. Just outstanding!
534,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.4,L: Dark dark brown with a half finger head that fades quickly
535,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.64,"A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing S: Tropical fruit and citrus up front along with some lighter dank notes T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of tropical fruit, bitter citrus peel, and dank notes. Bitterness takes hold to start but levels off as some of the tropical notes take hold. Some vanilla/cream like notes in there as well to help balance. Finishes with lingering citrus and tropical notes M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation O: A very good DIPA that is super saturated hop-wise while remaining incredibly drinkable. Highly recommended"
536,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,5.0,"Had this at Hill Farmstead last week. Amazing funk notes on this. Super perfect gueuze, The funk is awesome and sour. Looks great. Pours perfect. The taste is even better than the smell. This was the 2013 LPG."
537,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.5,"Looks like orange juice in my glass with a dense pearl-white head that is Saran Wrap going down the glass. Biting citrus aromas on the nose, with grapefruit, ripe oranges, passion fruit, and that dank note Mosaic and Amarillo hops both purvey. The taste is an exotic citrus/tropical fruit flavor parade, with the dank grapefruit and orange flavors my favorite. Wow, what a flavor ride this is. If you like hazy, this beer has to be on your “gotta have” list. World class, IMHO."
538,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.74,"LAWSONS TRIPLE SUNSHINE TIPA 5/30/19 Acquired at the brewery 5/26/19 but canned 4/17. Poured from the 12 oz. can into an Alchemist stemmed tulip. a: Stunningly beautiful clear amber with an inch thick offwhite head which receded to thin surface foam and very dense lacing. s: Pine resin and citrus. t: Very pleasant citrus & pine combo followed by a moderate hop bite on a mixed dry and sweet finish. Tropical fruit notes follow that. the high ABVis covered extraordinarily well. m; A delightfully oily medium, very good body and carbonation tingle. o; Triples can be overhopped nightmares, but this one is superb. Been a long time (probably five years) since I have had my favorite Lawson's brew, Peril Imperial IPA, but this is also a powerful, flavorful joy. It looks gorgeous and tastes even better.."
539,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.46,Look - classic nehazy and golden color
540,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.54,"Gold Wax bottle poured into a snifter. L: Jet black, no light escaping through."
541,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.66,"Pours pitch black with little to no head. Nose it’s bakers chocolate, sweet coconut, getting some barrel heat, grain alcohol. Taste follows the nose, rich milk chocolate, coconut, get a little oak/bourbon note. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Overall, delicious stout. As I’ve stated on several of my BA AC reviews, the only knock this beer is there is not a big barrel presence here. Otherwise, fantastic."
542,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.24,"Pours pitch black with a nice two finger brown head. With very little lacing. Aroma is booze. Taste is is sweet marshmallow, huge maple syrup,and booze. "
543,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.85,"Drank Oct 3rd 2018. Purchased in OKC at a local store.  Dark, dark appearance with approx 1/2 inch of thick head. Very thick feel, like a thin syrup almost. Taste is out of this world. One of the best I’ve tried, easily. Overall, very very good brew. Prairie, you’re doing it right! That said, this amazing brew ain’t cheap. One of the more expensive 12 ox bottles I’ve picked up. But I tell you, it’s worth it to at least try it once. I’m gonna go buy a couple more bottles despite the price. It’s worth it."
544,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.83,"batch 1, bottled 1/3/2014, decanted and served in a white wine glass Look - decanted was a ruby red, white head and once poured into a glass it lightened up to a pink grapefruit color, slight white head that disappeared quickly, nice lacing for a 7% lambic Smell - barnyard hay, sherry, and heavy oak and can smell the acid. Some complexity to it and a little fruity, but overall fairly mild nose Taste - earthy, some citrus, light grapefruit, and some notes of apricot and white peach....jammy, but not quite in a way a fruited sour is jammy, but the way these flavors molded together with the mouthfeel, it just kind of seemed a little like liquid peach jam. Feel - extremely drinkable and refreshing. Very mild tartness. An obviously delicate lambic as it goes does. Overall - A+ experience to be able to have this bottle, decant it, and share it with some great people. A lambic I likely will not get to enjoy again, but this was an amazing, complex, flavorful lambic that one of the best of the evening."
545,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.69,"Tan head but not a lot. Dark brown/black color.  Nose is sweet and the maple shows a lot. Vanilla and cake fudge. Peppers are faint in the nose. Nice barrel flavors. Nice amount of cinnamon. Taste: The maple is up there and the peppers show much more. Sweet and spicy. Cocoa and vanilla. The heat builds up. Typical cola/dr. Pepper flavors I get from the other cakes. Cinnamon. Awesome bourbon flavors. This was up there with risers and I actually preferred it more because the peppers showed more. Still could be thicker, but so complex and so enjoyable. 2018 vintage:"
546,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.24,"It seems like I'm always a day behind when I drink these. Who cares anyway, it's like underwear with the days on them. You honestly telling me you don't just feel like wearing Saturday some Mondays? Anyways, I'm pouring from a 750 ml. 2016 bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out just like the others, way lighter than beers similar in the style. Brown in color with highlights all the way through. The smell is warming bourbon with a mocha backdrop. Raisins and plums evident as well. The taste comes in with that same burning sensation and provides dark fruit notes. A very nice chocolately finish. There is some coffee and mocha presence in there, but for the main part it's slight and if not advertised, I think most would just think of a bourbon barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy and great for the style. Overall, this has probably been my favorite of these so far. But still nothing blowing me out of the water. I guess I'll just keep swimming."
547,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.59,"Review number 2900. Big thanks to JLindros for sharing this with me in honor of his 5000th review. 2004 Vintage. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice hazy golden copper hue with a good one finger white head that fades to leave good wisps and lacing.  S - Aromas of huge acid notes, excellent cheesy barnyard funk. Excellent almost grapefruit like aroma, hay, very fruity. The beer just pops with Drie Fontain. T - Taste is similar to the nose, really good acidity with excellent funk. Really good barnyard funk nice cheesy funk. The fruity notes are excellent with good grapefruit citrus notes. M - Mouthfeel is lowly carbonated, a bit slick. O - Overall this was a very good Belgium beer, excellent funk. Really glad I got to try this beer! Serving Type: Bottle"
548,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.98,"A - 2 inch tan head with uneven bubbles that holds well. Pitch black. S - Prunes, cherries, and a hint of wood. T - Malty and sweet with a hint of bitterness. M - Mouth coating and thick with lots of burn. O - Boozy and full bodied. Smell and taste are powerful and pleasant."
549,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.31,"Lift Bridge Barrel-Aged Silhouette, 11% ABV. Pours black, with a slight brown head that left no lacing. Nose is moleasses, chocolate, bourbon, char, and dark fruit. Taste is chocolate, moleasses, bourbon, roast malt, and coffee, with a moderate bitter close. Excellent mouthfeel, overall excellent."
550,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,3.94,Got this one from rutger this past summer. Cheers!  From a 750ml bottle into a snifter
551,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.45,"Canned 4 days ago and tried blind alongside a 10-day-old can of Haze. Both my friend and I were shocked to discover that we both slightly preferred regular Haze, and actually both guessed that it was the Very Hazy -- the aromas were almost identical, and the flavors were juicier on the Haze and more bitter on the Very Hazy. Same fluffy mouthfeel in both. Both are stellar beers, but regular Haze wins both in terms of drinkability and availability 89/100"
552,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.03,"Canned on 10/6/20; consumed on 10/12/20 Pours a deeply hazed, dark golden orange body topped with a finger and a half of fluffy, white foam; good retention yields a thin veil of cap, a creamy, moderate collar, and a vast array of soapy lacing draped along the walls of the glass. Aroma opens atop a grassy, flowery undertone, with a neutral earthiness guiding to bright orange and subtle nectarine; a lemony acidity amplifies over time, though a creamy texture fluffs off in the distance for a naturally integrated sweetness to an soft bouquet dripping with citrus, catty tones, and flaky malt textures. Taste features tart passionfruit in waves across the palate, accented with fresh grapefruit, musty grains, and cracked peppercorns; orange develops along the mid-palate, with a lingering catty character alongside brighter citrus fruits on the finish. Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fluffy, semi-creamy, moderate carbonation; flaky malts form a pillowy crispness, becoming plush and effortless across the palate as a minor hoppy acidity builds to a clean, semi-tart finish. The expression of Simcoe here is beautifully tempered, and though the hop profile as a whole doesn't provide as much cohesion, Hill Farmstead's signature refinement offer ample comfort; this level character puts the quality of this NEIPAs construction at the forefront, bringing attention from a more subdued profile to the overall easy enjoyment it imparts throughout."
553,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.4,"375ml bottle - dated 121218 - poured into a classic tulip at 48°F.  Cork immediately pushes upward as the cage is loosened, abd as I let go, it hurts out with a huge, forceful percussive *POP!* - flying several yards away. Some cork rot is visible. Pours a clear ruddy deep reddish copper-brown hue, topped woth a finger of coarse pinkish-brown head that quickly reduces to a thin collar, fed by streams of effervescence climbing the glass walls.  Nose: Absolutely stunning right from the start. Bold, intense aromas of lightly toasted grains bringing a gentle caramel sweetness, big musty cherry that has begun to lose its battle with age, warm, fruity red wine notes, with just enough oxidation to lend some sherry and brandy characteristics, and a panoply of stewed dark fruits. There is a present, but balanced brettanomyces influence, lending the perfect amount of musty funk, forest floor, dusty cellar, petrichor, and this sort of morning-on-the-lake aroma. and it's all held together by a splintery oaken halo, which provides some leather, varnish, and old parchment. Beautiful. Palate: Supplication greets the palate drier than the aroma would lead one to believe. The grain peeks through just a touch, with a hint of dustiness, while the cherries, with all their sugars fermented out step up with big funky, mushy skin and pit notes. Interestingly, the wine character lacks all fruitiness, and reveals itself with dry, tannic, soaked cask notes. As it opens up, a plummy dark fruit note emerges midpalate. Acidity is mild to moderate, with a quick twinge upfront, and quickly extinguished by the dry, tannic, splintery white oak. There's plenty of musty, dusty brett funk, reminiscent of overripe apricot pits, but there's also this subtle earthy, almost mold-like funk that may very well be from cork rot. The finish is exceedingly dry, with plentiful woody oak.  Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is light to medium-bodied, bright, snappy, and exceedingly crisp for nearly 8% ABV. The grains to lend some soft texture, and the fruit addition, while dry, does lend additional body. Effervescence is lively, zippy, and foams up over the palate. Tannic and drying.  Overall: This is a very nice, classic fruited wild ale. I love the jammy stuff as much as the next person, but there's something beautifully rustic and raw about these ones. Every ounce of sugar has been fermented out, leaving a seriously musty, funky, fermented cherry flavour, relying on that touch of grain to give it body. The funk is very earthy, but plays well with the cherry, and the wine translates as mature, funky, wet oak - and lots of it. The subtle plummy notes are tasteful, and it all comes together to show the ale's depth and character. A fantastic offering."
554,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.98,"This beer is one of Corey's best! This is literally Neapolitan icecream in a glass...with Bourbon. Notes of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla balanced with the oak of the barrel.  Seek this out!"
555,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.49,Appearance is a nice amber with a slight white head. Aroma is a strong citrus with a tough of hops. The taste is also a fairly strong citrus with a touch of hops.
556,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.6,Excellent DIPA. 
557,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.28,Vintage 2016.
558,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.45,"Bottled 11/19/18. Poured at 56 degrees. Fast fizzy tan head sits momentarily upon a deep amber/brown liquid; almost opaque with some clarity at the edges; no cap retention, ring or lace; thick legs sheet the glass. Nose is sweet dark fruit, malt, rounded alcohol and bourbon. Taste is prunes, sugary raisins, caramel and toffee; light roast malt, bourbon; molasses and oaky middle; no bitterness left from hops; boozy sweet finish. Some heat in the mouth with mild burn on tip of tongue; slick smooth feel; medium full body; low carbonation; face flushing warmth from 14% abv. Overall, I really liked this beer as there are intense layers of flavors, and it is port-like in sweetness, alcohol and feel; moderate plus malty sweet finish with plenty of fruit and barrel notes; highly recommend."
559,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.75,Theres stuff out there now that can absolutely rival this but having a good bit of IPAS before this one I can definitely say this beer is actually as advertised. Super tasty. The review below me said something about how rare it is that hype meets quality and I agree and that review is from 6 years ago. This was just really good and at least to me Russian River stuff is getting much easier to get at least in Colorado.
560,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.23,"Pours an opaque light straw color with a thin layer of head. The nose has both citrus and earthy notes. The flavor profile has citrus fruit upfront followed by a solid bitterness on the finish. The body is quite thin. Like the other Sues, this offering is good but over-rated and over-priced."
561,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.87,16 Fl. Oz. can poured into a Duvel Tulip @ 45° F. Best Buy 06/02/2021. Pseudo Sue turned up to eleven! My new benchmark by which all others (available in my area at least) will be judged. Outstanding!
562,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.46,"Thanks to my friend DW for providing this 16 oz can. Fairly pale golden color, hypercloudy. Pours a nice white head, creamy and lingering. Big dank hop aroma, funky orange. An intense fruity hop aroma. Combination of malt and fruit sweetness up front, flavors a bit more subtle than the aroma. Carries some orange flavor into the finish. Bitterness is very soft. Flavors are very rounded and smooth. Medium body and carbonation. A bit of a tongue coater but not hop astringent. Alcohol is well controlled given the strength - minimal warming. An intensely hoppy beer, but well done. Has a smooth flavor profile that is consistent from beginning to end. A bit dangerous given its strength."
563,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.43,"12 oz bottle, 2018 vintage, cellar treat, sent from Junior, into a Prairie Rastal glass.  This marvelous beer pours a wonderful raisin color with a harvest gold head of 1/4 finger. Recedes to a polite fingernail and stays. Swirling leaves a few micro legs. Aroma is that of a really settled-in beer. Like this one has had some time to really develop and mature into what it is. Tons of wonderful aged dates and raisins, with shoe leather, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and fig. Hints of chocolate, and a nice hot alcohol aroma envelopes the whole thing.  Toffee and raisins start this one off, followed by a burnt char note and some piney hop, and then the sweetness returns with caramel and sticky fig, some paper/cardboard, and then fades out on tobacco and molasses. Very complex. A bit sharp and bitter, I'd prefer a little more smoothness, but this flavor profile is bonkers.  Feel is sticky all the way to the bank with heat throughout but a cooling center. Moderate buzzing carbonation paired with warming alcohol that coats the gums and tongue. Leaves a bit of resin on the finish.  Overall, this is a really wonderful barrel aged old ale and one I'd try to find again. I do believe I liked their BA stout better, but this is absolutely no slouch.  Price paid : Trade"
564,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.21,"A - Pours a pitch black color with a thick toffee colored lacing ring. S - Rum, chocolate, dark fruit, and a touch of vanilla. T - Lots of rum flavor and noticeable warming on the way down and somewhat medicinal. Vanilla, rum, oak, licorice, raisons. M - Velvety, sticky, thick and full bodied. O - The overpowering rum dominates and masks the other flavor in the beer."
565,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,5.0,"It is simply not possible to make a ""better"" beer than this. Some beers may be different, others may prefer different style, but none can be better. Perfection for what it is ."
566,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,3.69,"This actually looks like coffee, except for a webby tan foaminess that quickly dies to next to nothing but a gold chain. Smell is maple, oak, bourbon, mocha, candied nuts and a hint of dark fruit. Taste is so strong of alcohol that it leaves only a slim space for flavors of syrupy mocha, candied nuts and sweet bourbon oak. The heat is spiced and slick, stinging as it slides quickly down, with a semi-dry, lightly sticky finish."
567,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.67,"2019 from San Diego Wow there is a lot to like here. The base stout big and fudge-y. Everything else compliments rather than overwhelms it. The bourbon barrel is subtle, sweet, and warming. The vanilla is assertive, but luscious and not artificial. The coffee is difficult to discern but does add a nice layer."
568,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.53,**
569,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.38,"Poured from 16oz tall can into a tulip. Canned 6/16/20. Appearance: extremely hazy; practically a chunky level of haze, along with a nice medium-yellow hue. Haze! Smell: richly dark and dank hop aroma; it's quite herbal and earthy in character. I dig it. Taste: light and sweet and also somehow dank. Almost like a hop smoothie; if the hop flavors were tropical I'd call it juicy. Maybe hop juice? This beer is definitely very green indeed. There's even a bit of a spicy (not hot; as in the way ginger is spicy) hit at the back of the throat. Great beer. Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and creaminess. Not outstanding but quite good. Overall: I'm just plain enjoying the hell out of this beer. It's like May in a glass."
570,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.08,"Years ago when this was never available in my area , maybe I would have been blown away by this highly rated unicorn . Nowadays with so many choices and incredible micro brews being put out , well it’s great, but I’m not as impressed . I would certainly drink it, but there are so many great ipas in this price point nowadays ."
571,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.93,probably the best dark sour I have ever had.
572,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.47,"375ml bottle thanks to Steve. Darkish amber, small tight, creamy head. Aroma is sweet, vanilla, caramel, cognac. Boozy too, very evident. Taste is even better, sweet heat, mallty notes, vanilla, wooden barrel, cognac. While it is evident it is potent, it doesn't burn that much. True classic."
573,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.09,"For a stout, I think pitch black. For a ""winter ale"", I think brick red. This one clearly looks like a stout. Which is ok, it just doesn't look like I'd thought it hoped for. Still, the obsidian body is beautiful, the khaki foam above is minimal, and it has a swagger about it coating the glass with each swirl.  The aroma also leans more on the stout side if the fence, but that just may be our accustomed nature as of late to associating boozy barrel to big stouts. Their is, however, plenty of toasted bread and burnt brown sugar to defend the winter warmer namesake. The coconut would be completely overlooked, or I guess I should say unnoticed if it weren't for the advertisement on the bottle. Similarly, this continues the theme of stout. Chocolate, caramel, and brown sugar are met with fig, black cherries and... sure, let's go with toasted coconut. Oak creeps up in the finish along with a well established alcohol and indistinguishable blend of spices. A graham cracker base only intensifies as it warms. Now the hard part. It's sappy, sticky, rich, and smooth. Boozy, warming, sweet, and spicy. Toasty, roasty, fruity, and bold. If I rate as a delicious beer with a wonderful texture, this hits the marks. If I label it as a Winter Ale, this lacks the cleanliness and bitterness it so desperately needs. As I browse through others reviews before my own, I've noticed a common sense of confusion in style. This, unlike original B- Bombs I've had in the past, has mistaken itself for a stout. While it is without a doubt delicious and well made in all accounts, it's not a ""Winter Ale"" unless we've just changed the prerequisites with this offering. Regardless of what it is or is not, get one if you can. It's wonderful. Cheers."
574,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.04,"Swung by Trillium on the way through Boston. Grabbed a 4 pack of these along with some other goodies. Can dated 6/5/19 and poured into a tulip glass. L: Deep wheat/orange with a good 2 inches of froth that sticks around for a little bit but quickly fades.  S: Deep mango richness - tropical bubble gum and some citrus zest. Quite aromatic - you can smell the beer after you pour. Almost a bit of peach. T: To me, the taste doesn't necessarily follow the nose of this beer. I taste lots of rind, some pine, and a bit of zip that isn't exactly peppery but something to that effect. A bit of an alcohol burn/taste that is a little unusual - perhaps a unique batch? F: Another review mentioned effervescent, and that is a great description. Along with the high level of carbonation, its pretty zesty. O: A nice APA, although it definitely reminds me more of a NE IPA. Great aroma but I didn't find this as easy to drink as many of the other great NE IPAs out there these days. I'm sure that Trillium has several others that are stronger than this offering."
575,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.94,L: Dark onyx hues with a rich dark brown and sandy head
576,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.68,"Beautiful, almost opaque straw color. Aroma is white wine, oak barrel, warming alcohol, various stone fruit aromas. The taste follows with oaky, dry white wine. Plums and apricots and a slight alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, on the thinner side with a good level of carbonation. Overall, another great beer from HF. Expertly blended and look forward to saving my other bottle for a while!"
577,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.31,"Had on Tap at Hopocalyse Day 1/23/16 A: Golden to almost orange hue. good creamy white bubbles S: some resin, hops, citrus, some slight guava.

580,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.67,"2018 vintage. Released about a year ago. A: Pours jet black with a thick cap of dark brown, espresso-like head. Recedes quickly to a sharp ring. A few dots of lacing. S: Dark cocoa, toasted coconut, oak, vanilla bean ice cream, and bourbon, with light roast and anise rounding things out. Very well balanced between the various aromas.  T: Rich liquid chocolate, moderate roast, toasted coconut, oak, bourbon, cola, and vanilla bean. Moderately sweet, like the base, but balanced more than the base with the bourbon and roast.  M: Thick, chewy, and full bodied with medium carbonation.  O: Exceptional BA pastry stout. Pretty sweet, as expected, but the sweetness is balanced with the other elements, all of which you can pick out individually."

586,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.38,"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle dated 01/06/2020. Sampled Dec 5, 2020. Gorgeous dark brown to black pour with very dark, foamy head that slowly fades to nothing. Big aromas of chocolate, vanilla and a hint of coffee. The body is better than medium but also chewy. The taste is sweet and full of chocolate and vanilla. I pick up some of the 12% alcohol in the taste. Warming finish. Slow sipper."
587,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.65,Every sip tasted different. But every sip was phenomenal! Never guess this was 11.2 ABV! So smoothe. Caramel bites really make it. Bourbon not too strong. The hint of vanilla. I'm in love!
588,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.56,"2017 vintage: A bit of malt, molasses, caramel. Sweet. Light brown color, translucent, not much head. Plenty of barrel. Fantastic. 2020 vintage: This can is quirky, but okay - points for novelty. Lots of caramel, raisin, and barrel. Very, very sweet - nearing pastry level. Slightly thicker and more opaque."
589,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.06,"7 ounce draft served in a juice glass, which doesn’t seem like the best choice. Lots of raspberries, some funk, a decent amount of tart and sour. It’s good, but fairly straightforward and not as complex as other highly rated wild ales/sours. Was expecting this to be much better."

592,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.75,"A good friend brought this to MN from his home in WS, and it is his favorite. It could be mine if I could find it. The score indicated on this site is well deserved, such a complex and flavorful beer. BUT, like some of the other high-alcohol beers one has to be careful. One cannot stop drinking but in so doing can find himself passed out."
593,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.74,"Look: I had one in the can (as recommended) and one in a glass (for comparison). The beer pours a hazy light gold/straw color with different yellow hues.  Smell: Blood orange, citrus peel, mangos, passion fruit, flowers.  Taste: follows the nose, you get the orange, passion fruit, etc up front and it follows with pine and a beautiful floral character. More bitterness than your standard NE IPA, but not at all overwhelming imo. Excellent tasting beer.  Feel: smooth silky mouthfeel  Overall: I liked this beer way more that I expected to. I had it side by side with heady and definitely preferred it over heady. Great beer! Quick note: I didn’t notice much of a difference between drinking it directly out of the can and drinking a pour of it, but the can may have been ~5% better."
594,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.49,"Dark ipa almost, dark orange and tan notes create an impressive head that holds its own for a few minutes. Aroma seemed to be somewhere along the lines of citra, summit, amarillo and simcoe.  All the usual Alpine hop flavors, fruit, hides alcohol, pine, mary jane, mango. Extremely crisp and dry finish. Just another excellent big dipa from Alpine, all the usual feels. Not as good as Nelson though."
595,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.71,"I tend to be the kind of person who ends up underwhelmed by the beers that end up on the top 250 list ... especially when they're IPAs. But every once in a while, I try one that not only completely lives up to the hype, but surpasses it - Abner is one of those beers.  Pours a cloudy, opaque, but bright orange color. Three finger frothy white head slowly dissipates leaving just a splotch of foam on top of the beer with a ring of white foam along the outside of the beer. Sparse white lacing coats the glass as the beer is consumed. The aroma on this is incredible. Sweet and fruity without being too ""juicy"". Undertones of dried pine needles and grassy hops peep between notes of orange, tangerine, peach and mango.  The taste follows the nose with notes of sweet orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple given way to a mild piney bitterness on the finish. There is a certain sweetness to it, but its very mild and balanced. The bitterness on the back end, kind of build on itself resulting in an overarching lingering bitterness on the palate.  Feel is pretty light for a DIPA, Very smooth with bright, vibrant carbonation.  Overall an absolutely stellar DIPA and worthy of its hyped billing."
596,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.68,Quite a good Bourbon barrel aged beer if anything I guess it could use a touch more barrel character but it really did round out the aggressive hops and roast that the base beer has. Plus I think people are also forgetting how affordable this beer is I picked up a couple cans for under $4 each and that is quite a steal for such a treatment. Sure it may not be 100 out of 100 but it is still a very smooth easy drinking bba stout.
597,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.5,"Double Sunshine use to to be a fancy waxed bottle""whale"", but now you can buy as much as you want at the new brewery. I am a big fan of the East/West coast mashup and this is a good example. The nose and taste are tropical fruity notes and are balanced by a strong malt backbone and subtle bitterness. It is strong and the alcohol is there, but it is melded well with the hops and malts. Definitely a step up in flavor from SOS"

599,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.46,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass. A: Dark brown to black, and opaque. A thin tan head fades fairly quickly atop a low level of visible carbonation. S: Really nice on the nose. Whiskey and chilis, chocolate and coffee. Sweet malts mixed with vanilla and oak. Notes of drying tobacco and toffee and Bit-o-Honeys. Awfully good. T: Chocolate, chilis and coffee up front. The whiskey heat comes next, with significant oak and vanilla flavors. Caramel, more vanilla, and cacao nibs. Tobacco and some roasted malts add some bitterness. More chocolate and coffee with mild but definite chili heat in the hang. M: The body is heavy, though not as thick and glass-staining as Hunahpu. Low carbonation sensation but fine for style. Alcohol presence is actually pretty restrained for style, but it remains warming as it goes down. O: This was really, really good. The barrel complimented this beer more than I expected. This all really works well. Nice chili flavor without a ton of heat. Definite barrel presence without overwhelming the multiple adjuncts. Excellent. NOTE: I knocked down my ""Overall"" rating a little. I had a second bottle that I reviewed, forgetting that I had already done so. I didn't care for the second bottle nearly as much, with an estimated BA Rating of 3.95. I decided to enter in the tasting notes from the ""better"" bottle, and left the given scores alone. But the Overall is decreased as there may be some bottle variation here."

601,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.45,"A: Pour’s a merlot, ruby rose color with some transparency. The head is minimal with absent retention, and lacing S: Raspberry jolly rancher with sour patch kid elements: An abundance of raspberries with some cherries and assorted berries popping out. Juicy, sugary sweetness with subtle acidity/funk T: Bright, crisp, rich berries and fruit with lactic funk, and a tad bit musty. Notes touch upon citrus, lemon, a little bit of vinegar, some vinous like components, and an oaky inclusion  M: Medium to light body with scarce carbonation. Soft yet fairly flat with a morsel of dryness that’s integrated and balanced adeptly O: Nice take on a fruited Lambic, that doesn’t come across as one-dimensional. A fragrant and aromatic nose with palatable complexities"

603,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.66,"Phenomenal. Best HF IPA I've had. Gorgeous hazy appearance. Smell is dank hops and melon. Taste is watermelon rind, citrus, dank hops, cantaloupe, and even more dank hops. Hops make the bitter finish that's just particularly interesting. It's not a normal bitter. It's almost a sweet bitter which is an oxymoron I guess. So good. Barely a hint of alcohol.  Super drinkable but thick bodied IPA."
604,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.79,"Over the past few weeks, I seem to be blindly picking some of the best-ranked drinks on this platform. This one definitely falls into that category. Huge citrus open and pour. Generous grapefruit & pineapple front end, with hints of mango and kiwi. Luxurious milky feel in the mouth and swallow. Light green dank balanced with grain on the exhale. World class imbibe, indeed."
605,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.52,"Orange juice color with a light tan head topping it off, this beer glides down your glass and clings like Velcro. Wow, what a sight to see. Dank citrus notes dominate the nose, with juicy tangerines, pineapple, and grapefruit leading the aroma parade, and those aromas translate perfectly to the taste, with the glorious addition of a vegetal taste that softens the citrus acidity, and the slightest bit of caramalt flavor to lend the perfect balance to this phenomenal DIPA."

609,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.59,"12/23/11 bottle date. Ten year expiry. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a 3F fountain tumbler glass at t brug beertje. Pours a maroon hazy body with a pink head that reduces moderate rate to leave a ring of retention. Aromas are heavy cherry and lots of funk - cherry jam and old basement, sharp lactic. Just fantastic. Taste is heavy on the cherries with a very balanced tartness, oak, yeast, funk, with a dry but flavorful berry follow through, finishing tart and fruity with light oak. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation and rich cherries. Just fantastic- great for those who love heavy cherry flavor with a good amount of tartness and funk."
610,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.58,"Tasted this as part of a fruited Fermier set. The nose promised an acidic affair, but was quite soft upon tasting. This was my second favorite fruited Fermier to the Abricot. A really nice beer, but perhaps its rarity is driving up ratings a bit."
611,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,"Hill Farmstead lives up to its amazing reputation with this one. This is beautiful to look at, wonderful nose, great balance and lasting pleasant finish. This beer is one of the best around for the style."
612,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.5,"Tried multiple times and great consistency to a bona fide world class 100 point beer. This one has it all and delivers every time. Big, bold, well made and just makes you happy. Great with a bold meal!"
613,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,5.0,"Worth the hype. Pretty much everything that can be said has been: great, complex flavor, with an especially outstanding dry hop finish. Really an excellent, excellent brew. Note: I gave the look a 5 even though I couldn’t see it, since I drank it from a can like a proper citizen."

Black as night, with a wonderful, dense beige colored head with good retention and lacing Looks amazing. Aroma is rich, sweet and malty. Taste is roasted malts & unsweetened chocolate. In typical HF fashion, it 's well balanced in a nuanced way that other breweries don't always nail. Simple, yet complex. Little bit of bitterness, yet smooth. Feel is soft and creamy. Good beer."
615,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.58,**
616,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.53,"Founders Breakfast Stout is an amazing beer that luckily can be found widely. Poured from a bottle in a 4 pack into a traditional pint glass, the stout pours deep black with a slight umber cast around the margins. A head barely forms before disappearing to the edges creating a ring of light cream that lasted until around half way through the drink. The edge thins to create a dark umber ring as I tip the glass back for a drink.  The stout smells mainly of coffee and dark chocolate with slight hints of caramel and malt. The taste is supremely balanced which is why this beer is highly rated. Immediately the coffee and chocolate hit on the front. I was anticipating a bitter or alcohol taste (due to the higher than average alcohol content) when the flavor moved back but that never happened. The coffee, roast, and chocolate continued all the way through and left a slightly spiced aftertaste. The stout feels medium thickness but not creamy due to its low carbonation. Swooshing the the beer in my mouth it does have a creamier feel as the little amount of carbonation in the beer comes out.  Overall, this beer is packed with flavor and has nearly no negatives as long as one enjoys coffee and chocolate! The only thing that could potentially be better is a creamy head, but that may mess up the balance Founders has struck with this gem."
617,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.29,"Pretty much exactly as advertised: a big coffee stout with complementary notes of chocolate and vanilla. Thick and viscous in the glass, has that coffee ice cream aroma shared by manny of the best new-age coffee stouts. Flavors pack a big punch of espresso and fudge. The thick, velvety, luxurious mouthfeel is definitely the high point for me. Reminds me of the mouthfeel on Trillium's pastry stouts when they are successfully executed."
618,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.5,"Draught at Jester King. Pours a hazy bright golden color with not much head. Funk, apricots, wholly apricots Batman, and some tartness on the nose; follows onto the palate. Light bodied. Finishes tart and dry with plenty of lingering apricot fruit."
619,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.65,"Vintage 2015 A: Pours a dark purple, with a ruby reddish hue. Head is less than half an inch high with pinkish and blueberry highlights; good retention, and beautiful lacing S: Plethora of blueberries amidst barnyard hay. Excellent funk presence with sensible bitterness that’s all very lively, earthy, and aromatic: lemons, oak, strawberry jam, raspberries  T: The blueberries, berry skin and seed take the lead. Nicely acidic, tart, and funky with compliments of earthy grounds: hay, grass, oaky barnyard gobbledygook M: Foremost crisp, clean, and perfectly balanced with a soft yet lively medium feel; earthy component brought forth graciously O: Ridiculous amounts of blueberries yet cultured, and complex: lingering raspberries, grapes, strawberry jam, and lemon with a timely funk/tartness"
620,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.15,Maybe this will grow on me but initial impression is too tart and acidic. I prefer a duchess de bourgeouene or however TF its spelled. I guess I'm a sour rookie.
621,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,5.0,"Pours light copper. Clear. No head or lacing. Looks more like a cognac than a beer. Aroma of raisins, currants, figs, oak, bourbon, rye, brown sugar, molasses, maple, caramel, vanilla. Taste follows nose. Medium to full bodied, no carbonation. Warm, semi-sweet finish. This must be nectar, drink of the gods. A truly unique experience. Try it at least once in a lifetime."
622,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.06,"Good but not as good as Bomb. I wish there was more bourbon and the mouthfeel was thicker. Good flavors but a bit muted. Glad I got to try it but at this price point (9 bucks for the bottle), there are better choices."
623,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,3.95,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 12oz can* *Canned on: 11/21/19* *Drank on: 05/03/20* This beer poured absolutely pitch black and had a dark brown head which had some nice rocky bubbles to it. The head was about a finger thick and had moderate retention. Nosing my glass, strong notes of bourbon hit my nose first. This was then followed by notes of black licorice, caramel, dark chocolate, and coffee. There was a tiny bit of vanilla in the back-end. I wasn't the biggest fan of the black licorice aroma on this, but the depth and complexity on this made up for it. The taste followed the nose with notes of bourbon, caramel, coffee, and dark chocolate upfront which faded in the middle to just notes of bourbon. There was a notable earthy taste to this beer throughout, and the beer finished with lingering notes of bourbon and earthiness. This beer was big, full bodied, boozy and it didn't try to hide it. You definitely have to sip on this one, and with a large coffee/bitter burnt and earthy aftertaste, I definitely wasn't in a hurry to down this beer. I can definitely see this being really good for some people with a tasty for bourbon forward, roasty and earthy stouts, but this one wasn't really for me."

The beer smells of bourbon, brownie batter, baker’s chocolate, and chocolate syrup. It tastes of brownie batter, chocolate syrup, Oreo, with a strong bourbon kick. It is full and complex, but still drinkable. This is an excellent ba stout."
626,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.62,"2014 Gold Wax I’m tasting Carmel, bourbon, black licorice, vanilla. Lucky enough to drink the whole bottle myself. Barely any carbonation at this point. Extremely delicious! Yum yum"
627,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.55,"500 mL bottle poured into snifter. Near black with a thin mocha head. Nose: bourbon, rich dark chocolate, undertones of cinnamon. Tequila is subtle and provides an added layer of depth without overtly smelling like tequila. Very complex and really pops. Taste: Follows the nose. Bourbon, rice milk, chocolate brownie batter, cinnamon. Hints of tequila on the finish. Tons of layers and depth. Only knock is that it is pretty sweet. Feel: full-bodied, appropriately low carbonation. Smooth."
628,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.92,First glance this is a beautiful hazy beer with next to no seidment. Poured with minimal head. Smell of tangerine and pineapple with subtle dankiness. Taste was wow. Incredibly balanced juice bomb with perfect bitterness. Feel was very soft with a crisp finish. The slight dry bitterness on the backend left you longing for more.
629,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.03,"200% opaque dark orange mango and carrot puree with a tall off-white foam that settles to a frothy film and a lumpy collar leaving coral lace. Smell is spicy and peppery cannabis, even resiny at times, blending into orange and pineapple smoothie and Smarties. Taste is tangy and spicy cannabic pine, toasty salted cracker, and lemony mango. Crisp up front filling to softly frothy, the body is medium and finishes cotton dry."
630,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.64,"Space Trace is one of two beers procured by friends who wanted to help me out after my Dark Lord bottles were stolen. I don't know how they made this happen - something about New Glarus Strawberry Rhubarb bottles - but, I love Bottle Logic, and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to try Space Trace. I was really startled by how barrel-forward Space Trace is. I'm a bit accustomed at this point to how vanilla forward many of their beers tend to be - but Space Trace smacks you in the face right away with a strong barrel nose and taste. It's follow by lots of chocolate and coconut, with very pleasant bourbon notes. It's a thick, rich beer, which is a very nice change from thin coconut beers (typically rum barrel-aged). While I really love Space Trace, it's one that doesn't drink itself - it's delicious, but it's an active drinker - it requires attention and appreciation. I could only drink just a bit of it - certainly not a whole bottle - at a sitting. Then again, it's summer - so it may just be a seasonal thing! Feed me a bottle when the temperature dips below freezing and you may hear a very different review!"
631,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,5.0,"My favorite barrel aged beer. PERFECT blend of all advertised flavors. You can kill one in 5-10min, or have it be a sipper. Bless you Jeremy Kosmicki (brewmaster at founders)."
632,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.12,"I don't generally love hoppy beers that are over 8.5% because they're too heavy and sweet, and this one is just those things. Hill beers have unrivaled mouthfeel and elegance, and this is just overdone. Intended I'm sure, given that it's 10%, but I'd take most of the Hill single and double IPAs over Ephraim."

634,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.63,"Pitch black with fast fading head, great cocoa and vanilla nose, and massive cocoa flavor. Coconut seems to hide out in the background. Nice full and smooth as silk mouthfeel ... so bottle logic!"
635,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.49,"Deep purple color. Nice sour blackberry in aroma. A little sharp at first, but the blackberries come out nicely in the finish. A little funky but falls more on the sour and acidic side. Really nice overall, nicely done blackberry sour."
636,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.84,L: Slight opaque honey yellow haze with minimal head
637,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,5.0,"Enjoyed on premises of MBC in 9/20. Gorgeous warm, golden wheat color. Frosted opacity. Modest, bright white head. Smells crisp, fruity and a touch bready. Tastes like a top shelf New England IPA, but for all it’s hoppiness, not a hint of the soapy quality some of the IPA/DIPAs can have. The bitterness and grassy notes were balanced with tropical fruits and some warm, yeasty flavors. Even non-IPA lovers, like my husband, can enjoy this one."
638,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.9,"Not sure why there's not a separate listing for each blend of Anabasis, but I'll note in here separate dates for different blends as I try them. Blend #2, Side Project Invitational. 02/02/2020. Blend #5, WickedBeer Side ProjectShare 07/10/2021. A delicious non-adjunct base barleywine. Great balance of barrel and dark fruit. Undertones of tobacco, fig, leather and caramel really round this out well."
639,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.61,"Two month old can. Cloudy orange yellow hues, fluffy lacing. Tangy citrusy notes of pineapple and mango on the nose, follows on the taste. Slightly dry finish, subtle booze presence. Very good."
640,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,3.77,"Looks like orange juice as do most beers of this style. Smell is pineapple and citrus, with dank hop underscoring the bill. Taste follows suit with a sweet malty finish. I liked this beer. It’s not bad by any means. But it is very similar to many other beers of this style both made by TH and other brewers. Will not seek again."
641,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,5.0,"Batch 1 bottle, so thick, so sweet. Smells exactly like German cake, great smell. Pours nice and thick. Great dark look. Taste is one of the best. Angry chair barrel aged stouts are fantastic."
642,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.93,"This beer tastes perfect to me. Hints of my very favorites, Very Green and Juice Machine. It’s got a crisp taste to the tongue like VG then gets very rounded to the roof and back of mouth. Strong hop that’s utterly smoothed out by the fruit. It’s like they’re flipping levers on all the elements to dial it all into balance. Don’t miss this one."
643,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.58,"BBE: 28.01.2025 L: Really, really dark brown, borderline black, hard to see through. Creamy, frosty 1 finger head. Holds nice lacing. S: The first smell, I get the same kind of characteristics I got from the Rochefort 6 and 8 - caramel, nutty. Although this one is different, there's dates, raisins, some hint of dark cherries singing in the background. A chocolate-rum (sign of some alcohol) cake nods its head and welcomes for a bite. In the distant horizon, a banana, cream kind of flavour shines through, maybe its my imagination? T: I mean.. the nose was definitely interesting, but the taste blew me away. How this caramel, nutty, honey glazed toffe, banana, nuts, and everything else are so well balancend and easy drinking? From smelling I thought maybe its going to be a bit better than the middle brother, Rochefort 8, but it was really, really good.. Definitely tastes better than it smells. F: So smooth, very well balanced, medium/high body, creamy nectar. 11.3% ABV? no way.. O: After drinking 6 and 8 from the family, which weren't that special, I expected that this is going to be a bit better, but not this good. Maybe it was the low expectation that took me by surprise, who knows. All in all, this is a special beer, haven't had something this good in a long time.."
644,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.29,"Pouring a blend of ruby jewels, pink and neon purple, with a thin, very pale purple foam, I'm also seeing red, figuratively, at the prospect of being toyed with by JWB again, ala Troll So Hard and Haterade. However, right away, the old lady says this smells like Hawaii. She should know, having just returned. Passion fruit, dragon fruit and pear pop all over the nose, with Sweet Tarts and mango dashed in. Taste is really tart with a little funk, where the passion fruit and dragon fruit come through surprisingly well. I also get some sour apple and a hint of lemon. Frothy, tangy sour, crisp, finishing semi-dry. For some reason we have had a lot of guava, passion fruit and dragon fruit recently, having just visited Hawaii, among other things. Upon coming back, it seemed like all of a sudden a number of breweries were using these ingredients in a variety of their beers. You can really tell the difference between the good and the not so good. This was one of the better experiences, and I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, because JWB makes two other ridiculously neon beers I love to hate on. With DFPF, though, I'm not finding much I can knock."
645,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.34,"Deep gold with excellent clarity; white head; poor fizzy cap retention, yet solid ring; some spots of lacing. Nose is dank earthy mangoes, orange, lemon, grapefruit. Bitter lemon peel right off the bat; mango and orange earthy hop middle; semi sweet malt foundation. Bitter bite/burn on tip of tongue; medium body, moderate carbonation; some warmth/astringency in mouth. Tasty long citrus rind linger, but bitterness overshadows the malt and it tastes/feels hot, even though I don’t detect any alcohol and abv is just 8%; I’d drink again, but I’ll know what I’m getting in the bitterness department."
646,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.11,"Somehow missed reviewing this. 2015 vintage.  Pours a mild fizzy darker head that fades semi quickly, a touch of lacing but long legs, very dark beer but some brown light coming through the thin parts and the pour Nose is like an aged bourbon barrel stout, lots of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malts but softer aged roasted, some roasted coffee but not a ton, roasted earthy coffee, a bit of char, nutty coffee and or beer, caramel toffee and sweet malts, a bit of aged complex soft malts but dark malts, mild vanilla barrel and some sweet bourbon, a little toasted biscuity malts Taste brings bitter roasted malts and a bit of char, roasted coffee beans but not a ton, roasted malts bringing bitterness and a bit of char, some cocoa and dark chocolate, baker's bitter chocolate, a bit creamy as well, a little burnt caramel and toffee, fudgey a bit, almost like cocoa nibs, a bit of alcohol but not a lot, mild vanilla barrel notes and a touch of sweet bourbon, not much, a bit of candy and some soft aged malt feels. Finishes sweet but not really sticky, a bit of tingly alcohol, plenty of dark chocolate, some roasted malts and coffee, bitterness from roast. Mouth is fuller bod but not very rich and thick, decent carb, some tingly warming alcohol  Overall mixed, some nice big beer characters, decent coffee although it obviously fell off, although I think there would have been too much roast and acrid that seems to have died off, alcohol is still prevalent, barrel seems to have tapered off or was not much to begin with, although it added a nice soft aged complex malt, mouth was def too thin as I expected a nice rich chew thick mouth. Need to try it fresh to compare someday."
647,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.67,12oz bottled 11/4/20. Opened 2/18/21.
648,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,3.49,"Hot black with a slim brown edge and a thin tan film. Smell is Hot cola, roasty malt, bourbon, and chocolate, bringing flavors of light maple, Hot bourbon, slick, thick chocolate and barrel notes. The hype is too Hot! ...and this was batch 1!"
649,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.53,L -- Pours a lovely hue of red with modest clarity and a half finger of rocky white head produced with moderate pour. Very minimal retention or lacing
650,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.92,"Loved how boozy this was. Had a 2014 in 2019, so 5 years old. I have a 2015 coming up that I can't wait to open. Can't do it on my own, though, at almost 20% ABV. A beastly beer that's meant to be shared."
651,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.5,Bottle at Akkurat in Stockholm. I think this was a 2011 Akkurat blend. So perfectly balanced - not too sour and not too funky. The Lou Pepe are really a step above the standard Cantillon releases and that is really saying something.
652,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,2.78,"This is a beautifully made DIPA that I just don't like very much. Beautiful bright amber, with a dense white head, and expected haziness. The aroma is bright, like smelling mint, but very subdued and without any specific aromatic character, except for dankness. The taste is also bright and cool (mint-like), but without any distinct malt or hop flavor that is appealing. (The flavors actually exists for a brief moment , but disappears immediately into a clean bitterness that erases any impression of what you have just drunk.) The body is more like an IPA than a double IPA, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'm sure this will appeal to those who are looking for a clean, refreshing blast of alcohol, but I'm looking for more aroma and flavor in a DIPA."
653,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.49,"A classic. This one is 2018. It looks just as it should, calm and a little dangerous. The nose waves a baseball bat worth of flavors around behind its back and says “I’m going the hit you with this, very soon”. Raisin/cherry fruit tones come to the fore, backed by brandy and vanilla cookies. And of course, the taste does indeed clobber you with huge crescendo of coffee, fruit, booze, char, leather and umami. Fantastic. The mouthfeel, again, is just as it should be. This is a unique beer and very much deserves its high reputation. Speaking from experience, and without any fear of contradiction, I can also report that this beer ages beautifully."
654,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,3.4,"16oz can poured into a snifter. A: Black on the pour with two fingers of brown head. Retention is good, lacing manifests in broken rings. S: Nose is heavy on the chocolate. Brownie batter and a generous helping of Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Fatty nibs. Bit of woody roast and earthy hop. Berry-like fruity note. Nutty coffee. T: Follows the nose. Chocolate all over the attack. Cocoa nibs, brownie batter, chocolate syrup in a big way. Sugary lactose. That berry fruitiness comes through tasting like a raspberry tootsie pop. Pervasive background flavor of nutty coffee. Quick flash of earthy hops, and woody and roasty malt flavors poke through now and again. Perhaps some subtle cola. Roasty and Chocolatey finish.  M: Rich and thick in the mouth. Coating and almost syrupy. Tons of residual sugar. Carbonation is ample but gentle, and fluffs things up a little. O: Might be an unpopular opinion, but this is just too sweet for me. Tree House has a penchant for taking all of their dark beers well onto the sweet side of things, and some fare better there than others. Here there is just not quite enough hop, coffee, or black malt bitterness to bring it into any semblance of balance. It does finish drier than it starts, but it isn’t nearly enough to save the drinkability. You gotta have a serious sweet tooth to enjoy beers like this, and unfortunately I find that I tend to favor balance and dryness as opposed to a candy-bomb like this. It tastes like chocolate syrup and sits like 16oz of chocolate syrup in the stomach. Looks like sweet sells though, so maybe I’m just an old grouch now."
655,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.21,"Very viscous like motor oil on the pour. Opaque with a modest dark tan head that settled quickly. Aroma was full-on pastry with rich chocolate, salted caramel, faint coconut, and vanilla. Taste followed. Very thick and dessert-like. Flavors were bright, although on my palate the coconut tasted more like a sweet marshmallow compliment to the chocolate. Delicious and well-executed but I prefer less sweetness on the end."
656,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.59,"Blend 9 (April, 2019) - 500ml bottle - poured into a wine stem at 45°F. Pours a translucent deep blood red, with garnet highlights, sitting like pinot noir in the glass, a think collar of pink foam circumnavigates the ruby elixir. Just stunning. Nose: Incredibly intense raspberry aroma. There's a jammy element like raspberry preserves, atop a true wild raspberry bush aroma, with ripe raspberries, unripe raspberries, raspberry seeds, stems, and leaves, macerated raspberries, overripe raspberries...Raspberry squared. There's also a massive vinous note - like a bold red wine, perhaps a grenache, with berry compote, blackberry, strawberry, blueberry, red grape, and a big oaky note. There's a hefty funk presence, with old wet wood, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, rackhouse, dried leaves, hay, and even some horseblanket. A slight grassy note as well. It's complex, concentrated, saturated, and absolutely incredible. Palate: Like the aroma, this beer greets you with a facefull of raspberry. Not sourness. Not funk. Ripe red raspberry. Super organic, like an actual raspberry. Jammy, sweet, tart, seedy...liquid raspberry. You get my drift here? You take a raspberry...and drink it. A wild, but balanced acidity follows, bringing some lemon- like tartness, and just a whisper of balsamic vinegar. There's plenty of farmhouse funk, with wet hay, wet wood, and a dusty, musty, earthen note that just screams ""Texas"". The oak note is similar to bourbon, with some leather, caramel, and vanilla undertones, and then some grain peeks through underneath. The tartness overtakes the sweetness, introducing some lactic minerality, quickly drying the beer out, and finishing dry, with raspberry essence, tingly tarness, and oak. Mouthfeel/Body: Atrial is a light-bodied ale, but the raspberry sweetness does add just a touch of weight, giving some smooth dimension to it all. Acidity is bright, sour, but restrained - far from heartburn territory. Effervescence is moderate, and super fine to a champagne degree. Sweet and wet to start, finishing nearly bone dry, and quite clean. Overall: This is a special beer. There's a reason it is so respected, and I fully understand it. There are other amazing raspberry sours out there, and I've had several of them, but Atrial Rubicite is in a league of its own, and is without a doubt, a world class wild ale, and one deserving of praise. If you're reading this and wondering, stop wondering. Get the bottle."
657,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.71,This one poured a bright red with a slight pink head that didn't last long.
658,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.68,"2019 bottle. Minimal foam head upon aggressive pour, with color being deep deep dark brown, with caramel color foam that disappears quickly. Aroma is of rich bourbon barrel sweetness, which also is beautifully present in the flavor. The barrel presence and sweetness shines without coming across too boozy. Still somehow very smooth and balanced. The mouthfeel is perfect, especially as it warms, and thicker than 2018 Damon . This beer should be served and consumed around 10-12 degrees C.  Hill Farmstead does it again."
659,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.22,"Canned 12/24/20. Pours a moderately hazy light gold, robust 2"" egg shell head with excellent thick lacing. Nose is dank, juicy, and hempy, even nearly two months. out. Tropical fruit, mango juice. Thyme, pine, poultry spices. Only the smallest hint of rawness from the hops deep in the nose. The taste is more subdued than the powerful nose; slight oily, spicy, resinous, and bitter notes throughout, even numbing like a sichuan peppercorn. Moderate juicy sweetness, but the hop spiciness is strong enough to prevent it from taking a leading role. Mouthfeel is typical - round and soft, light carbonation. I was more impressed with the aroma than the taste, but its spiciness was enjoyable."
660,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.7,"This is my personal white whale. I've been trying to get my hands on this beer for years. Even More Jesus is my favorite stout and I've been dying to try the BA version. This beer pours a thick, darker than midnight, jet black with a late forming, dense, dark brown with a tinge of maroon colored head. It recedes quickly to a sliver of a ring around the edge of the glass, and there are just a few spots of lacing. Smell is chocolate fudge, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar and sweet dark fruit. Taste is the same. Starts of sweet but definitely not cloying, with a nice mix of chocolate, vanilla, raisins and figs. That transitions nicely into brown sugar and toffee mid sip and finishes with a wonderful blend of bourbon and oak. Feel is thick, decadent, rich and velvety smooth with a slightly sticky finish. Very low carbonation which makes the body feel that much more full. Overall an excellent beer. The bourbon compliments the other flavors wonderfully and is not hot at all. My one complaint is that the subtle, smokey char that I love so much in EMJ is not present in the BA version. Still an awesome beer, but I slightly prefer the original."
661,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.4,"Canned 08/01/19, 10:11:09. Lightly pale golden yellow.. opaque in appearance and without much of any rising and/or settling head above the beer. Small dots of lace cling to the glass. The nose is more hop-forward than you’d think; scallions and grassy hops, with undertones of underripe papaya and bright citrus.  Great balance of hops and fruit on the palate. Pineapple-heavy, with undertones of mildly bitter tangerine and dank, grassy hops. As it opens up a little more, lime really stands out and compliments the hops. Lighter mouthfeel than I expected. Fairly sharp carbonation, with a smooth finish that leaves a noticeable stickiness behind. Very mild booziness, a smooth 8%."
662,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.36,"=2018 release (batch 2). A: Pours a pale orangish with no head or lacing. Decently hazy.  S: Moderate oak, sweet white wine, light barrel char, vanilla and cardamom, light earth and barnyard. Balanced toward the oak. T: Leans more towards the white wine and green gooseberries than the nose, with light dry oak barrel and a moderate sourness through a long finish which is cut partially by a dose of sweetness. The palate comes off as a sort of sweet and sour thing. M: Soft medium-light body with medium-high carbonation.  O: Really tasty stuff. The sourness is just a touch too high/sharp for my taste, and the sweetness is a bit high, but otherwise great flavors and balance between base and oak."
663,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.15,"I don’t know and I don’t care. This beer to me is anything you want it to be. Lying in a meadow with her; standing on top of a mountain peak overlooking the world, or simply sitting your ass on the couch and cold hard chilling. Because it’s beautiful. It just hits me, it caresses me ever so softly. And if I could, I would caress it back. Slap me, baby, I’m happy. Slap me, beautiful, because I am alive. Good day."
664,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.63,"Canned 4-23-20 L: golden hue, straw with an orange tinge. Hazy, but not turbid; translucent rather than opaque. White head, limited lacing and retention S: resinous, pithy citrus rind, tangerine T: largely follows nose: melange of citrus fruits, a healthy dose of rind, and a resinous undertone that carries through the sip. Finishes with a clean bitterness and a touch of caramel malt sweetness F: very nimble while maintaining softness. Supple carbonation and a bit of resin holding it up. This is the best batch of DS I've ever had. No onion this time around and an abundance of soft tangerine. This lot of citra helps focus me on how thoroughly Lawsons kills the mouthfeel on this."
665,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.42,"Pours a deep black in color with a finger plus of light brown head that has excellent retention and leaves behind some sporadic sticky lacing. Aroma has roasty, coffee, and chocolate notes. Taste is full of sweet caramel, roasted malts, coffee, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and a touch of bitterness. This is full bodied with moderate carbonation and a sweet, almost syrupy mouthfeel. I really enjoy the aromas and flavors aside form the level of sweetness and syrupy mouthfeel; I’d those were a little dialed back I’d be much happier. I’ve had previously batches and I don’t remember this being quite so sweet."
666,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.71,"Bottle at the brewery on 3/10. Delicate fermentation, honey from base beer is all but gone. Nice, mellow tartness, lots of barrel characteristic. Funky finish. Very good, but I don't think it quite deserves the hype, nor value it gets."
667,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.25,"Funky Buddha Brewery ""Maple Bacon Coffee Porter"""
668,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.36,"Shared with JLindros. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice lightly hazy golden hue with a thin white head that fades to leave light wisps.  S - Aromas of juicy, musty apricots. Loads and loads of fruit here great stone fruits. Fragrant and floral. Very nice bright apricots.  T - Taste is similar to the nose, very nice apricot, both fresh and dry. There is really good stone fruits, great floral notes. Light acidity. Very nice.  M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, crisp, clean. O - Overall this beer was really apricot forward, very enjoyable.  Serving type: bottle"
669,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.42,"09/2017 - The nose is out of control - cinnamon, coffee, cardamom for days; amazing flavors akin to the nose with some spice; solid mouthfeel for an imperial porter; lactose, roast goes on and on!"
670,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.54,"Appearance: Utterly black in color showing no highlights whatsoever before a strong light and crowned by a massive and dense tan head with superb retention. Thick lacing reminiscent of a natural sponge adorns the glass wall.  Aroma: Massive notes of bourbon, cocoa, and sweet alcohol greet the sense. As well, there is milk chocolate, chocolate syrup, bitter cocoa, molasses, dark bread, burnt caramel and wood. Hints of vanilla and spices appear along the way, as well. Taste: The taste begins with a wave of cold coffee and bitter cocoa. Soon after, the notes of bourbon and wood rise and a gentle warming from the alcohol presents. As the taste progresses, a pantheon of flavors present: bitter cocoa, milk chocolate, dark bread, roasted nuts, vanilla, and white pepper. Late in the taste, milk chocolate and wood dominate. Finishes with a lingering note of oak. Mouth feel: Extraordinarily smooth, full, and rich, with a fullness similar to that of half-and-half. Just a hint of carbonation adds interest. Drinkabilty/notes: Without reservation, Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged is utterly superb. This slow sipper seems more than appropriate for a sharply cold Valentine's Day, with ice and snow flurries. Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce aluminum can, served in a La Fin Du Monde tulip. 02/14/2021."
671,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.79,"The beer pours a hazy straw yellow with a moderate white head, it has medium carbonation. It smells of apricots, nectarines, and red wine. The beer is tart, with big apricot, juicy nectarines, red wine, and oak. The beer is multi layered, and very juicy. An excellent saison from Side Project."
672,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.61,"Look: Very dark black color with a small amount of dark tan head. Decent lacing. Smell: Getting a ton of chocolate malts and coffee, followed by the slight hint of vanilla and some dark fruit notes.  Taste: Coffee is big and dominant when cold. As it warms the more chocolate taste there is and a decent amount of vanilla flavors.  Feel: This has a thick and creamy mouthfeel, with a very nice dry finish Overall: This is just an excellent porter and I am loving this beer."
673,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.34,"32oz crowler purchased at Community Pint, in Spokane, Washington, for $24.99. Presumably, it's the 2020 vintage. Poured into a sniffer, this was an inky black of considerable viscosity. Very thin, light-mocha colored head that dropped fast but never died away. Spotty lace. Aroma is of dark, roasty malts, cinnamon, and ground peppers. I don't get much vanilla. Lots going on, though.  All the flavors noted in the nose are present in the flavor, with all of them melded together pretty well, although I think the cinammon and the peppers jump to the fore. The cinnamon gives it a graham crackery taste that would almost push the beer into pastry stout territory, but for the peppers providing a mildly heated contrast. Practically the definition of a full bodied beer. Creamy, almost gooey mouthfeel. Really nice massive, adjunct imperial stout, though not quite the amazing beer that folklore has it being. Still, if this was a regional beer, I'd hit it regularly."
674,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.5,2017 version poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter. The coconut is present but not strong in the aroma or flavor. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is moderately thick and creamy. There isn't much booze presence but a little warming in late finish. Really enjoyable.
675,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.24,"Canned 09/15/20. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint. A: Hazy gold with 1-2 finger frothy off-white head with excellent retention and sturdy lacing. S: Herbal undertones to the hop aroma with minty, peppery, melon coming through strongest, with some pineapple and red grapefruit in the background. T: Flavor is also melon-heavy with some lemongrass and herbal notes in the mid-palate and pineapple and orange in the finish. Pale maltiness is substantial and lends light grainy sweetness. Bitterness is medium with mild fruity esters. M: The feel is a bit high in minerality for me with a little chalkiness in the finish. Body is medium with low-medium carbonation. O: A great NEIPA with a more bitter edge which I like. Thanks to my generous friend Eric for giving me the chance to try this exceptional beer from an exceptional brewer — did not disappoint."
676,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.49,"Simply slathered with Mosaic hop character, the uniqueness of Melcher Street New England styled IPA by Trillium doesn't stop with simple brewing techniques, but rather a double dry hopping addition of the coveted hops for extra tangy, green and fruity complexity.  The Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street pours with a standard yeast extract appearance on a goldenrod backdrop. As a rich ivory froth builds on top, the perfume of succulent tropical fruit, citrus and herbal notes swoon the nose. The taste jumps right out with a shortbread type of bready sweetness that hinges on light caramel, honey and a slight cakey texture. And then the true and radiant character of Mosaic hops shines on the middle palate and once the sweet maltiness begins to recede. Strong overtones of passionfruit, under ripened orange, gooseberry and lime show off the unique charm of the hops with a tangy, green fruit citrus and tropical medley. Trending peppery, botanical and nearly tangy, a grass filled late palate sheds the light on sassafras, white grapefruit, green tea, hemp and verbena. Medium bodied and carrying a moderate bitterness, the smooth but drying ale lingers medium long on the finish with the discernible taste of tropical fruit rinds. An alcohol spice of gin and juniper lasts nearly as long as the hop bitterness even though a linger of bready malts hangs in tow."
677,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,3.99,"A few years ago this beer was fantastic. Now, something just is not right."
678,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.1,"16 April 2020 - Beer #70 - BA Top 250 Alert! Corona Day #35 I'm back, baby! Appearance: 4 - looks like a standard barleywine, but a bit darker and redder. It was pretty clear on the pour but almost completely opaque in the glass. Nose: 4 - smells like a barleywine on some barrel. A bit fruity. Nothing special so far. Taste: 4 - still nothing special. It's definitely a very nice barleywine, but I'm not sure why it's so highly regarded. Mouth: 5 - thick, chewy, and round. A very well-crafted brew. Overall: 4 - a very fine offering, but not anything I'd write home about. My wife would find it very odd to find a hand-written note about a good but not great BA barleywine. Be safe! Cheers!"
679,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.6,"Appearance - The beer poured a silky black color with a dark mocha colored head.  Smell - The nose was the of a sweet barrel aged stout. The booze and cinnamon are noted, but not the heat.  Taste - At the front, my first impression was black licorice. It was not nasty black licorice, since it was balanced by chocolate syrup, coconut, and dry green apple. My disappointment was that the pepper spice of the base beer was gone. There was a hint of cinnamon, but little heat. The barrel notes become more pronouned as it warms, particularly the apple brandy.  Mouthfeel - The beer was big bodied, just hovering on the tongue and allowing the test profile to develop.  Overall - The beer was great, but I missed the spice of the base beer."
680,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,"Is this the best beer in the world, many would argue that is true. While trying on draft at Toppling Goliath, it’s hard to imagine the rich smooth sweet maple balanced by coffee could be all be pulled off the nose, staining the glass. And the flavor and taste to be met with fireworks from the grand finale."
681,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.56,"2008 Vintage Appearance: Inky black pour with a minimal khaki crown that show little retention or lace. Smell: Lightly charred oak, grainy roast malt, a hint of black strap molasses, faint cocoa powder notes, and a touch of floral heather. Taste: Lightly charred oak, grainy roast malt, dash of alcohol, brewing salts, and a dash of vanilla. "
682,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.75,"Bottled 9/24/13; drank 8/8/15 @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Muddy brown/purple appearance.  Minimal dark tan head; no lace.  Raisin, caramel & faint booze heat notes in the nose.  Thick mouthfeel.  Milk chocolate, port, sweet caramel & molasses flavors; no booze heat.  Insanely drinkable considering the a.b.v., this is a sweet dessert treat that isn't cloying. A triumph of the brewer's art."
683,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.79,"My first time with this brew, I was a bit taken aback. But my second, third and fourth times were much more appreciative. Hopslam lives up to it's name....you down one of these and you know it. Higher alcohol content and and a sweeter taste than its cousin Two Hearted. Both are great beers."
684,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.6,"Appearance - The beer poured brownish black in color with a tan head.  Smell - Maple and coffee dominated the nose.  Taste - As expected, the nose was very maple coffee forward. I was disappointed as there was not much bacon. As the taste continued, the coffee grew more bitter in back.  Mouthfeel - There was so much sticky sweetness with little carbonation.  Overall - It goes without saying that this is a great beer."
685,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,Smell: early morning pancakes and coffee before work that wakes you up
686,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.5,"2012 version, at Lambik-o-droom. Slightly hazy dark golden color with creamy beige head. Aroma starts with hay, dry meadow flowers, unripe stonefruits and some lemon. Taste starts tart upfront with unripe fruits, but also with a fruit pits, seeds and skin bitterness. Hay and farmhouse notes throughout, funky but not too extreme. Light to medium body, dry, light to medium carbonation. A really well rounded gueuze, sour but quite easy to drink, funky but not cloying."
687,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.25,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of black cholate, bourbon wood and some tobacco notes is very interesting. Taste is a great mix of black chocolate notes with some light residual sugar notes, some bourbon and woody notes with light vanilla and some dominant tobacco notes. Body is full with oily texture and good carbonation. Quite the extreme imperial stout with tobacco playing a bigger role then I was expected."

689,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.37,"Pretty damn good beer. A masterful blend of tart and sweet in which you can actually taste peach instead of an indiscernible fruit flavor like a lot of other beers. Its light, crisp, a little dry, decently carbonated and has just the right amount of funk. Not the cheapest bottle but if you come across it, worth an indulgence."
690,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.72,"22oz. capped bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter.  Nose is divinely aromatic. Notes of raisin, dried fig, brown sugar, caramel, tobacco, oak, booze, and molasses. This is everything I want my English Barleywine to smell like. Perfect. Beer opens raisin, prunes, and plum. Dark fruit all around mixed with brown sugar, molasses, and oak. I do get that this is starting to fall off a little bit as notes of cardboard and wet wood are starting to appear. I get some chocolate, and fudge with more dark fruit, molasses and layers of oak and booze at the finish. Time + English Barley = Perfection. Body is full with low carbonation. Slick and oily on the palate and goes down soft but warm with little booziness. Long, lingering, sticky aftertaste that makes you consider what's left the palate.  I didn't have the chance to try this fresh but 6 years later, Omega Point is perfection. Definitely worth seeking out."
691,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.84,"This one pours a dark reddish color - jammy as all get out - with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells a little bit like red wine, vanilla, and oak - but it's mostly jammy, seedy, and fairly intense raspberry on the nose. This does a good job reminding you what the fruit here actually is - it's raspberry, duh - but there's more to it. There's some oak and slight vanilla sweetness, along with a really pleasant soft and inviting acidity. There's a pleasant smudge of wine barrel here. This is light bodied, with a super jammy and fresh mouthfeel, and a really great amount of drinkability. As far as straight up raspberry beers go, this really can't be beat."
692,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.81,Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Teku goblet. Look- A deep murky orange with a little over a finger of thick white head. A small amount of lacing down the glass. Smell- Lots of strong citrus with an awesome touch of pineapple. Made me want to hurry for my first drink.  Taste- There was not as much fruit taste as the smell led me to believe. The hoppy taste really balanced everything and I tasted more malt around the middle of the pour. Absolutely delicious and extremely drinkable. Feel- A full feel with little carbonation. Slightly dry but still very juicy.  Overall a phenomenal double IPA. Drinkable with just enough abv to keep it interesting.
693,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.43,"2017 vintage consumed in early 2021. Dark brown/black pour, not much head. Three and a half years down the road from brewing, the coffee flavor is almost undetectable. Cinnamon dances with oak and bourbon flavors to provide nice complexity. As the beer warms, the bourbon flavoring increases, overwhelming nuance, but that's quibbling. This is a world-class effort!"
694,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.69,"Bottled 04/19/18. Soooo much better than MBCP, but I’m blaming the fact that the base beer wasn’t fresh when I had it two days ago. This is not only “fresher,” but holds up much better in the bottle. This is how I expected the original to taste and smell. This is almost literally like being at a fancy donut shop and taking their maple bacon donut, some of their espresso/dark roast, and putting both in a blender. Then adding some deliciously roasted malt, a bit of earthy wood, and some booze. Such a sweet treat! Today is the big day. Hoping for good news soon."
695,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.46,"This is a true Maple and coffee bomb. For me to much maple, but it's a good stout. barrels are a bit behind on the overwhelming maple. "
696,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.67,"Finally, after a few years, and some adventuresome and muddy miles, she landed. Soft golden hue, fluffy juicy head, gently wine, oak barrel, and microflora tones both on the nose and taste, and silky smooth. Definately matches up with the hype. It was her, it was she, it was fabulous!"
697,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.23,"Enormous thanks to Jake for this one! Pint can - dated 10/06/20 - poured into an ale tulip at 40°F.  Hill Farmstead - Susan Pours a beautiful apricot orange - quite cloudy, but some translucency near the top, and capped by a finger of eggshell white head with good retention, leaving a tall collar as it recedes. Nose: Oranges. Tons of oranges. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, apricot, some grass, and a rather unique herbal element. Dank, slightly earthy, even slightly savoury, like leek or some kind of wild ditchweed. Planty. A good swirl reveals some lemon zest, gooseberry, white grape, and a hint of passionfruit, with this flower petal botanical note underneath, all atop a clean, rustic pale malt base. Quite expressive. Palate: Much like the aroma, the flavours are unexpected, layered, and throw you for a loop. It greets the palate dry, with clean grainy malt, followed by nicely acidic squeeze of tangerine, grapefruit, and Meyer lemon. A good bit of pineapple, with some nectarine and ripe guava. It takes a shift into Riwaka territory, with notes of passionfruit, gooseberry, white grape, fresh cut grass, and a greeness, which manifests into bitterness - grassy, herbal, and leafy, and finishing with a peppery bite. Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is bright in every possible way. It's medium-bodied, but very crisp and fairly snappy. The signature Hill water minerality really elevates the sparkling feel, and the lively effervescence cotributes to that. There's a touch of softness, but not at the expense of fluidity. Dry, crisp, and refreshing. Overall: When you've had a million IPAs, sometimes, you focus more on the little things, rather than the overall flavour. The overall flavour here IS good, and it's an interesting combination of hops, which throws a couple of curveballs, however, it isn't groundbreaking. What makes this beer great is not the flavour, but the little things that come together. The perfect malt balance, the careful hop acidity, the minerality, and the flow of it all. Its quality and heritage certainly show, and it's a great beer, if a little disjointed."
698,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.49,"Pours a cloudy orange juice. Nose is of orange, a little hopped pine. Taste follows.with a juicy citrus fruit and a medium citrus bitter. Feel is the viscosity of 2% milk with a nice fizz. Overall, let this beer breath for a minute and it opens up into a great vibrant juicy beer."
699,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.78,"Massive caramel and vanilla. Plenty of barrel. Not at all hot for the ABV. Creamy, sticky mouthfeel. Long, sweet finish. 2014 vintage, cognac seems to have fallen off a bit. Just a fantastic sipper!"
700,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.58,"A hazy lemon color with accents of tea. 1 finger of bubbly, puffy head that recedes to a line of bubbles.  Aroma is akin to ice cream, but with a dank, herbal, skunky aroma. Some rotting fruit rinds.  Flavor is very bitter, with hints garden dirt, rotten grapefruit rind, pine sol, lemon 409, herb, and harsh alcohol. Underneath, we've got the basic Cutting Tiles formula which is great - honeysuckle and ice cream. There is something very off about this beer's flavor - it's basically ice cream and lemon grout cleaner. Feel is creamy and lush, with a nice electric carbonation.  Overall, I'm mega disappointed this one didn't pan out. I couldn't do it - had to dump it. El Dorado is leagues better, and currently my favorite beer...this one is just not stacking up at all. How different versions of Cutting Tiles could be both my favorite and least favorite Trillium beer is beyond comprehension. What happened?"
701,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.75,What is not to like. Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a very pleasant blend of cinnamon coconut and bourbon. Taste is also an exceptional blend of cinnamon coconut and bourbon with a solid feel
702,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.42,"Every time I go to the Hill I find, by blind luck, outstanding beers I have never had before. This a great example of being in the right place especially since this was the first time I had been to the Hill when they have had cans available. YAY for that. I tried some on tap and then bought 4 4 packs as it was that good. Smooth, very tasty. I would buy this every time I go there and I hope it’s available."
703,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.63,"16oz Can poured into a Spiegelau IPA Glass. Canned 05/13/21. Appearance: Pours a hazy deep yellow with two fingers of receding head Smell: Tropical mango and pine Taste: Full, tropical flavors of mango and pineapple with earthy hop flavors full of complexity Mouthfeel: Full body with a satisfying finish Overall: A real stand out as far as the NEIPA category. There is an incredible amount of flavor and complexity that is not overbearing."
704,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.66,"16oz can purchased at the brewery dated 11/15/17. Hazy orange color and a fruity/hoppy nose. Flavors such as peach, mango, pineapple and a touch of grapefruit come through. A very tasty, smooth and enjoyable beer with very little bitterness on the finish. One of our favorite Trillium offerings."
705,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.29,"Thanks to WestCoastBeerDude for sending this particular bottle! 2015 vintage 375 mL bottle (I believe the bottling date was 8/3/15 on the label), and consumed on 2/1/18. Poured into a J. Wakefield OG teku glass. A: Beautiful light gold, and is crystal clear until the last 1/3 of the bottle is poured out - then moderately hazy. A good amount of visible carbonation, but the white head stays small and fades quickly. A pretty beer for sure. S: Dry Brettanomyces funk, stone fruit and apricots, and mild dry white wine. Cracker malts and a mix of citric and lactic tart. Mild oak tannins. It’s a dry funky Brett, rather than fruity and pineapple. T: Brett funk, sour lemons and citric acid. Lactic tart and barnyard. Dried apricots. French oak dryness as well. Cracker malts, dry white wine. Some sweet fruity esters and fleshy fruits in the middle. More dry Brett funk, citrus rind, pineapple, and tart juicy fruit near the end. Ultimately finishes dry with the French oak tannins and more stone fruit. M: A light body and low alcohol flavors. The carbonation sensation is a touch on the low side but not so much as to detract. O: Very good. The oak was a worry for me – I don’t always appreciate the French oak flavors. But everything plays so nicely with each other here – balanced, nuanced, and complex. Not overly vinous, not overly funky. While I don’t think there’s apricots or peaches in here, that dry flavor pulls through with the citric acid and lemons and adds quite a bit to the flavor profile. Really enjoyable, but likely not my favorite of the “-tion” series."
706,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.75,Pours beautiful pink/ruby with white reddish head. 
707,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.87,This is probably one of the best sweet stouts I have ever had. Very sweet with tastes of caramel and vanilla. Similar to a Founders CBS and has amazing balance. Highly recommend!
708,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.02,"This bottle label claims ""11.4% ALC./VOL."" and ""12 FL. OZ. (355ML)"" with a date of ""2018"" and ""No. 005"" Appearance: The body is black and it sports a very short head which is creamy textured. The head has minimal retention and it fades out to a ring with large bubbles around the edge. No lacing. Aroma: There is a prominent note of alcohol with some cherry and plum. There is a light bit of caramel aroma and a wet oak scent. Taste: Up front there is toffee an a bit of carbon. In the middle there is a coffee flavor with rich dark chocolate. It finishes with a lingering caramel sweetness  Mouthfeel: It is medium bodied with a nice even texture across the palate. It is smooth and easy to drink. It has a slightly sticky finish. It does an amazing job of keeping the alcohol content in check. Overall: There isn't a lot of Belgian yeast flavor to the beer but some exists in the aroma. The beer tastes sweeter than most Belgian Quads but it is done nicely and it is very enjoyable. This is very much a dessert beer and it could easily replace a caramel cake. The label states that this is ""BARREL-AGED"" and some wood character comes out in the aroma which could be from the barrel. I would drink it again and I would recommend it."
709,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.5,Blend 4. Delicious and well balanced lambic style fruited Wild Ale with Loads of peach and stone fruit flavors. Nice and tart but not overwhelming. Love this beer.
710,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.34,"22 ounce bottle, no date seen. Not sure where Pipeworks dates their bottles if at all. Poured into tulip. Pours a dark orange, rosy gold, half finger of head. Some fingers of head lace it’s way down the glass. The color of the body is not that appealing but I love a lacey beer. "
711,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.14,Copper colored with a murky complexion. There’s a fingernail of dishwater white around the rim and covering the majority of the top. Light lacing is present. The aroma is of tangerine and pine. I’m tasting tangerine and citrus fruit. The mouth is very resinous and lightly sticky.
712,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.54,"Bottle dated 10/27/17 into pint glass. Pours an encouragingly inky black with a negligible head. Initial impression is incredibly smooth, sweet milk chocolate, espresso, bourbon, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is silky-smooth - almost literally oily. Alcohol - all 16% of it - is quite well hidden. Finish is smooth and sweet."
713,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.43,"Nice orange, and pineapple aroma. Super soft on the pallet and finish with a slight bitterness. Great beer overall, but they have the bar set so high so wouldn't put it in the top tier of their hoppy offerings."
714,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.43,"03/2014 - There's certainly ethanol up front, with bourbon, Nutella, and some anise; decent mouthfeel that lasts with cocoa, plum, tobacco; subtle heat and booze, creamy and sweet finish."
715,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.24,"Unbelievably soft, like drinking flavored silk. Very unique, does not taste how it smells. Has a nice blend of citrus and grass notes, this one leans more to the malty side. Has a mild, clean, dry finish. Creamy and smooth and offers a nice change of pace from the world class juice bombs and/or other NEIPAs that have a dynamic flavor profile. Congress Street's flavor profile offers a certain...tranquility instead.  Interesting and refreshing, and dam solid, but not sure why it has 100 score. I'd give it a 91"
716,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.92,Creamy honey mango and pineapple with a background of orange. Medium mouthfeel and carb. Straight up the mango hichew if there was pineapple and orange in it in liquid form. There is a balanced bitterness with that hichew like sweetness.
717,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.83,Pours a deep onyx. Nice peanut butter aroma. Taste of perfect combination of peanut butter and chocolate. One doesn’t overpower the other. Smooth palate coating mouthfeel. Definite winner from Treehouse. The 7.6% abv a bonus.
718,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.33,Bought a single 12oz bottle $4.99
719,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.25,"Thanks to rudzud, 2017"
720,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.6,"Great beer. Amazing nose that smells of strong vanilla and oak. A bit thinner than other big stouts but great vanilla flavor. This beer is hyper focused on vanilla, so if that’s your thing, this beer is for you."
721,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,3.97,"Pours a shiny dark black color. one full finger velvety mocha colored head collapses steadily leaving no residual head. Thin ring of foam is left along the outside of the glass.  Aroma is predominately coconut - a bit suntan lotion-y - but still decent. Hints of cocoa. Its rather one note with the coconut being predominate on the nose. Also very sweet - you can just smell the sweetness here.  Taste follows the nose with strong notes of coconut up front. Underneath this, there are notes of roasted malts, chocolate, and vanilla. Not much in the way of barrel presence or bourbon.  Feel is semi-thick pretty slick and oily. Mild carbonation. Semi-dry finish.  Overall its a nice beer - to me the coconut is far too predominant - especially in a barrel aged beer."
722,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.59,"From growler. Pours a slightly hazy copper orange. Multi finger foam head with reasonable retention. Solid lacing. Smells of good, clean, hop fun. Bitter and earthy smell. A nice, more simple, great tasting beer. Bitter pine that makes way to a hint of fresh grapefruit. Smooth feel with strong carbonation and an assertive hop stick. Best ipa I've tried from these guys, thus far."
723,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.65,"Pours pitch black with a little tan head and a healthy brown ring. Smells like bourbon, vanilla, a little coffee and chocolate. The flavor is smooth bourbon, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and the oats make it super silky. Everything blends very nicely as is the case with most FW barrel aged brews. One of the best stouts, no doubt, buy it it if you see it, cheers!"
724,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.43,There are two things that most craft beer nerds get wrong about Anabasis:  1) The pronunciation of its name
725,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.96,"This beer is next level. Reminds me of OG Vanilla Rye on steroids. Has a bit more barrel and vanilla. Overpowers the coconut a bit but the sweetness is perfect in my opinion. Glad to be lucky enough to have acquired a bottle, really nailed it here."
726,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.93,"Received at The Festival in Portland a few years back. Had a couple weeks ago at Tasty Tuesday and it was delicious, so I decided it was time to try it, shared with rudzud, from Dec 2014, batch 2 Pours a auburn tan foamy thicker creamy head with moderate retention, good lacing, somehow clear darker auburn color Nose is awesome, layers of everything sweet, caramel, candy, toffee, big burnt caramel, big apple brandy like with some cognac and vanilla barrel, the aged malt is quite nice, big juicy aged fruit raisin, very aged soft malt slight winey oxidized character, but a good aged oxidation like character,  Taste is just awesome, just incredible, loads of juicy dark fruit, raisin plum like fruit and big caramel candy with some molasses but super smooth and fair sweetness, toffee, caramel, candy malt, reddish toasty malt, butterscotch toffee, a mild bitterness, caramel toffee and some buttery oak, sweet fruity cognac and apple brandy, vanilla barrel, drier finish with lingering sweet candy malt and toffee caramel brandy lingering, aged soft malt and barrel character Mouth is med to fuller bod, creamy soft med carb, very low alcohol for what it is Overall holy frig, this was just ridiculous, so smooth and ridiculously awesome, one of the best beers I've ever had, incredible barleywine that I really wish I had a bunch of"
727,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,3.37,Pours a nice hazy orange. Nose is very dank and pungent. Has huge carbonation and very dank for the NE IPA. It really surprised me with a super dry orange and mango end.
728,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.81,"Can dated 9/7/20, poured into a tulip glass.  L: Beautiful golden color. On the fringe of translucence.  S: Orange grove, meet beehive.  T: Delicious. Can’t believe this is an 8.5% ABV. The honey really takes the edge off. Citrus up front, wonderful - slightly bitter but balanced by the honey - finish.  F: Sharp and crisp, very long lingering finish.  O: One of the best beers I’ve had from Trillium. All of the elements really come together on this one. Wow!"
729,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.53,"Poured from a 16oz can into a nonic pint glass.  Pours a deeply hazy orange body with a two finger white head, reducing to leave really nice lacing. Great looking beer.  Aromas are tropical and pulpy, tons of orange creamsicle. Taste is pure orange creamsicle, sticky but soft hops, citrus, grapefruit, finishing with a delicate bite. I don't really get as much booze as others describe on the follow through, but I sure do feel it!"
730,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.47,A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a narrow light tan collar around the edge of the glass.
731,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.59,"2010 Sticker, poured into a taster. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation, funky, some oak and a bit of fruit. Sour but not puckering. Overall, a world class gueuze!"
732,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.73,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Teku glass. Murky brown color with vibrant fluffy white head. Continued effervescence after the pour. Scents of red wine, raisins, and yeast on the nose. Flavors of raisins, plums, baking spice, and brown sugar. Hides the ABV really well. Belgian quads are my go-to on Christmas and glad I had one of these to enjoy this year- a classic and always delicious!"
733,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.28,Really slick and tasty and does everything I’d want for a bba Stout. There is a nice caramel sweetness and the nose that really perseveres through the line. This is a sweet beer all things considered. But I appreciate the well constructed layers
734,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.68,"This is one of the finest imperial stouts. Tastes like prunes and chocholate with not too much sweetness. It also ages really well. Mouthfeel is think, but not too thick, and the ABV is off the charts."
735,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.65,"Another great Alpine IPA. These guys do an awesome job. Had this one a few months back and it was super fresh, super dank, great piney taste and hops came off with a perfect bite."
736,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.5,Bottle aged a year. I like some sugar but hate the overly sweet that still seem to score pretty high. This brew was the sweetest thing I've liked. Interesting. Bravo.
737,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.28,Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering a third of the top. The aroma is of of pine. I’m tasting a wallop of pine and a touch of grassy hops. The mouth is sticky and chewy.
738,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.41,"Great, but not the best. I would even dare to say St. Bernardus Abt 12 is beter. Don't get me wrong, it's among the best, but the hype around it destroys it's own imago. Give Abt 12 a shot, a touch better."
739,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.76,11 August 2021 - Beer #247 - BA Top 250 Alert! Acquired via trade
740,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.32,"A- Tallboy into a becher with a mildly hazy deep golden body and a luscious one inch cap. The had is thick and sturdy with a texture that is both foamy and creamy. Great head retention with plenty of lacing sticking on the glass as wide sheets. S- Definitely getting tons of the bitter and zesty hops up front with pine and citrus fruits first leading into some more subtle dank, tropical, herbal and floral hops. Grapefruit, mango, orange, peach, tangerine and a hint of juicy melon. You sense some light malts but mostly those bold hops up front. T- You can tell it is higher ABV but it doesn't drink quite like 10% as it carries a hit of booze that compliments semi sweet malts and the bold, bitter hops. Pine resin cuts into the taste buds right away with strong grapefruit and plenty of bitter citrus zest. orange, tangerine and some juicier fruit on the backend. Slightly herbal/dank with mango hints. Hints of two row barley and slight caramelized sweetness. MF- Not entirely sure why I am surprised but the body on this beer is just wonderful. Medium to heavy overall and about as smooth as can be with a creamy and silky texture. The carbonation is moderate and it ends with a double whammy of zesty bitterness and alcohol warming. Might be my favorite of the brews that shipped out to MA recently. Aggressive, bitter, piney and fruity brew that comes on strong but has a great mouthfeel to support those bold flavors."
741,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,5.0,"A: served draft at the brewery into a long stem tulip glass, intensely dark with a massive tan head that lingered leaving great lacing, clear, side note: this beer was from a separate tap served warmer than others S: supreme sweetness and bourbon, molasses, toffee, roasty malt T: like a marshmallow chocolate milkshake with a hit of coffee and a generous pour of high quality bourbon, a hop snuck in there at the end to remind me this is a beer  M: thick milkshake with no taste of alcohol O: I almost wish I hadn't tried this, because I think it ruined me. Every other barrel aged imperial stout will now be judged against this. Sorry KBS; I still love you."
742,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.21,"On tap at the brewery. Poured a very dark brownish black color with a hearty mocha colored cap. Bubbly carb, light lacing. Cocoa and spice, some coffee, sweet maple. I picked up more chocolate and coffee, the cinnamon and heat were less pronounced. Maple sweetness. Light porter body, slightly thin. Drank easily so I was cautious of sneaky alcohol. The flavors and touch of heat in the finish carried the drinkability. The flavor blend carried the brew. On the better end of porters for me."
743,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.53,Canned 2/11/2021. Consumed mostly straight from the can as suggested but I poured a sample into a glass to have a look and to get a good whiff.
744,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,5.0,"De Hopt. En copa Teku. Jugando a Gears of War. Con queso de Codi. Que cosa más rica! Cada vuelta de tuerca que le dan mejoran lo que parecía inmejorable. El sirope de arce es suave pero se nota, y el café delicioso. Resulta superfacil de beber a pesar del elevado abv, del que no hay ni rastro organolepticamente"
745,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.44,"Had this one at a tasting a ways back, from notes"
746,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.68,Look: Mahogany brown with big fluffy white head. Has medium carbonation.
747,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,2.61,"I don't know what was up with this, but I didn't find this beer very good at all. It was slightly tart on the finish, which made me think it was going bad in some form. I didn't get much barrel character, thinner mouthfeel and compared to all the other stouts we were enjoying, probably the worst of the night which is crazy. Likely just a bad bottle, but didn't know those existed with this beer. Unfortunate, but rating is as accurate as I can be with it."
748,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.29,"Impermanence is on the sweeter side of stouts - super rich, the maple comes through a lot, with a touch of coffee and a bunch of chocolate. It's got a thick, syrupy feel, but had enough of a malty base that it didn't feel like cough syrup. A tasty stout overall, but expect a lot of sweetness in this one, which may or may not be up your alley."
749,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.85,"It looks motor oil thick and used motor oil black and shiny in the glass. Minimal dark tan head rests on top and quickly diffuses into spotty islands of lace and a thin ring around. The aroma is huge vanilla, oak, bourbon, and dark bakers chocolate. Taste is Ah-mayze-ing! Super rich dark chocolate is the first thing that hits me, followed by some tobacco, vanilla, oak, a little coffee, and some slight bourbon heat on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, but still on the full side of medium. Oily, slick, coating my mouth at all angles with a dry finish but NOT chalky. Overall this is fantastic and every bit worthy of its high marks."
750,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,3.27,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This one smells like oxidization and cardboard, artificial vanilla, candy syrup, booze, and chocolate. I expected quite a bit more out of this beer. Given the 16% ABV, I expected that it wouldn't be over the hill, but it certainly is, unfortunately. It's oxidized, with old fruit and stale flavors. There's also a definitely artificial sweetness here, unlike most version of FO - they almost always have legitimate vanilla flavors. I am very disappointed here. This is medium bodied, and pretty creamy, with a heavy duty boozines on the very back end of each sip. This was honestly supposed to be really great, and it was instead massively disappointing. Something these things happen."
751,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.38,"Pours a hazy peach coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smell is initially quite lovely, with hoppy, juicy tropical/citrus fruit notes of mango and passion fruit with a hint of pineapple and tangerine, but takes on a light cat piss note as it sits. Taste is very bright and hoppy, dominated sweet, juicy tropical fruit notes of mango, passion fruit and pineapple and with zesty citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine. There's a light dankness and a hint of pine to this as well, almost no malt presence detectable though. Finishes with a light bitterness and very mild hop burn. Soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This is the quintessential NE style Pale Ale and I would say that it has an amazing juicy hoppiness, mouthfeel and depth of flavour for a Pale Ale, BUT is this even a Pale Ale at 6.6% ABV? Nonetheless, it's still an excellent beer at a relatively low ABV. The balance of sweet tropical fruit, zesty citrus fruit and dankness/pine really is outstanding here."
752,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.75,"Look: nice amber color, thin white head Smell: sour cherry, you can definitely smell the wine barrel in it Taste: follows the nose, plus lots of good funk in there Feel: prickly bubbles rolling over the tongue"
753,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.5,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass. Pours a very attractive dark brown with a 2 plus finger khaki head that leaves nice thin wisps of lace.  Smell is roasty coffee, toasted coconut, vanilla, and hints of toffee. Taste follows toasted coconut and coffee just dominate this beer and in a great way, vanilla and toffee lend a hand also, but very little. Mouthfeel is a big medium, plenty of life, a touch dry, and goes down bigger than 6.4%, but drinks very easy. Overall this is a great stout."
754,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.58,"750ml bottle, 2008 vintage, poured into a Drie Fonteinen fountains tumbler glass. Enjoyed on 1.28.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a hazy and cloudy copper color, big foamy white head, good retention, great lace clings to the glass. The aroma is super frunky, excellent expression of that distinct Drie funk that is so earthy yet citrusy and complex, lightly floral and herbal notes come forward with oak, green aged hops with some soft wheaty grain. The aroma is super bright and delicate, a really excellent display of what Drie is capable of. The flavors are excellent as well, great funk, dry dirty leaves, musty oak, bright citrus and an excellent floral character lingers well with some soft grain. The mouthfeel is great, very lively and crisp that coats very well with a tart and dry finish. Verdict: A stunning gueuze from Drie Fonteinen. Excellent complexity, beautiful expression of funk with tons of depth bringing out nuances of fruit, oak, spice and grassiness, really delicious and special stuff."
755,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.41,"From a 16oz can, dated 06/26/21. Saturday surprise! Served in an IPA glass. Pours a thick-appearing, milky orange with a finger-plus of super-soft, lathery head. Retention is just OK but leaves a thick, creamy cap and a heavy curtain of sudsy lacing. Nose is yeasty, bready, fruity, musky. That musky peach-pineapple-bubblegum thing but with an added ice cream-like quality. Tasting cantaloupe, cannabis, orange peels, peach, pineapple, and yeasty bread roll. Dense, dank and juicy. Mildewed, overripe, composting fruit. A long, slow bitter grapefruit juice finish. The aftertaste is 100% grapefruit juice. Feel is juicy, creamy, medium-hefty bodied but brightly enough carbonated to feel somewhat lighter. Overall, yet another over-the-top, over-hopped TH NEDIPA. Frankly, they all sort of blur together for me at this point, but I think this one is more bitter than usual, and particularly dank and weedy relative to the usual line up."
756,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.56,"Looks like a murky glass of white grapefruit juice with two fingers of pillowy, off white head sitting on top of it. The smell is simply grapefruit, sweet malt and pine. Tastes moderately sweet with a ton of grapefruit and pine. Creamy feel and a lingering bitterness. Fantastic beer."
757,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.24,2019
758,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.37,"This beer is notorious in San Diego. Available every 3 years and each time, it creates more and more pandemonium. The most recent sale saw their website crash 3 times, people's orders get canceled and semi-anonymous social media postings containing every combination of swear words and off-color memes you can imagine. But is it worth the hype? Sort of. Its good, REALLY GOOD in fact. At $40 per bottle and potentially waiting in long lines to get it...well, you be the judge. I was able to score some with relative ease online but I dont think Id wait in an hours long line for it. The beer is great, well-balanced, tart, sour, smooth and everything else you could want. This is the closest US beer to Cantillon that Ive ever had. If you can get your hands on it, give it a go. Just dont go bankrupt or sacrifice an entire Saturday for a bottle"
759,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.51,"This one pours a pretty dark black, with a small mocha colored head, and not much lacing. This smells like fruity and roasty coffee- the coffee is a strong aroma, but it doesn't completely dominate here. There's caramel, oak, bourbon, and tons of chocolate. The coffee flavor in this is super nice, and well integrated into a superior base beer. There's lots of fudgy chocolate, with vanilla and caramel providing a nice hint of sweetness, and lots of dark fruit and a slightly smokey flavor from the coffee. The barrel character is also killer here, with lots of not-too-boozy bourbon flavor and a hint of oak. My only real quibble with this beer is the body- I definitely wish it was a bit bigger. It's certainly not thin, though- it works well enough for me. This is a super underrated BA stout. Most of Jackie O's stuff is super underrated. This is highly recommended."
760,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.48,"This one was a jet black color with a fluffy brown head. The aroma was chocolate with toffee and bourbon. The taste had chocolate with some caramel, oak, and then a nice bourbon flavor. Nice creamy mouth feel. Very nice."
761,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.17,"2018 version. Was pretty spiced and not that maple forward. Was still very tasted and had a good bourbon spicy mix, with a little sweetness on the end. A little thin, but solid ba spicy/sweet stout"
762,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.85,"11/2015 - Batch 1 - Love when this warms - the cognac pops incredibly, the peach is lovely, and the funk takes a back seat; more peach, cognac, and barnyard on the palate, with some classic dG funk to round it out; pretty great body, with a lightly sweet, a touch acidic finish."
763,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.56,"2017 bottle. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Side Project tulip. Acquired in a trade. First pour while the sediment was still settled was a crystal clear golden body with very little head or lacing. Aromas are outstanding especially as it warms up - rich stone fruit, candied peaches, lightly oaky, fields of hay, tart citrus. On the tongue it’s pretty sour, tart stone fruit takes center stage, pulpy peaches, candy peach rings, light white wine, following by a light oakyness, a bit drying but not astringent, sour citrus on the finish. Easy drinker, moderately carbonated with a light refreshing body. A well crafted beer, the peach really shines. This was an older bottle so I’m happy the fruit is still present."
764,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.6,"27 January 2020 - Beer #13 Price: $59.99 on Tavour Appearance: 5 - a beautiful bright, ruby red with a white head. Gorgeous. Nose: 5 - intense cherry, less raspberry. Somewhat sour, epically fruity. Taste: 4 - can't give it the 5. It's excellent but not legendary. Decent amount of fruit, VERY sour. I need just a little more fruit. Mouth: 5 - tremendous. Extremely effervescent. The sourness and acidity make my mouth water even though it's already wet. Impressive. Overall: 5 - a masterfully crafted brew. I probably won't pay this again for it, but am I glad I got to try it. Cheers!"
765,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.4,"Canned 3/22/21. “Ha ha ha” stamped on the bottom of the can Here we are. One of the highest rated Tree House beers, currently sitting at #11 overall. I’m very excited to try this one, but slightly weary since OG Haze is not one of my favorites. Regardless, I’m hapoy they had this today when I went to grab some beer Pours a turbid pale Yellow with 3 fingers of white head that fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing This is like a tropical bouquet in the nose, but on the other hand it’s very similar to some of their others, with a little extra hop kick. I’m picking up on aromas ripe papaya, tangerine, pithy grapefruit, doughy malt, light pepper, resiny hops, and a touch of black currant. Actually, upon further inspection this has a huge depth not present in their other similar beers The taste is not nearly as complex, but I’m still enjoying it a lot. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting creamy peach, papaya, and creamy malt. The swallow brings notes of creamy peach, orange rind, doughy malt, overripe mango, and earthy hops A medium full body pairs pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a slight bitterness While the aroma was really good, the rest of it pales in comparison. Still, another good Tree House IPA"
766,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.14,"""Italy has a certain 'je ne sais quoi' - fab food culture, highly decadent history of art and cool countryside. Some might argue the people are loud and flamboyant, they steal our women, the succer players melodramatically flop on the pitch. Listen - that's all part of the secret Italian ingredient - keep it cool, confident, arrogant and extravagant. Forza Italia."" Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout, brewed with natural flavor and aged in Bourbon Barrels. Available in 22 oz. bottles and on limited annual release draft. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a snifter glass. (Appearance) Pours a rich, dark chocolate head of a crisp frothy consistency over a jet black, moderately viscous body. Retention is below average and lacing is light and patchy. 4 (Smell) Chocolate wafers, light caramel malt body and a delicate roast with overtones of Bourbon notes and a touch of sharp alcohol heat. The aroma of the body is perceptibly light yet appealing. Potency is moderate. 3.75 (Taste) Velvety, nutty chocolate forward with smooth caramel and vanilla undertones, finishing on a smooth transition to a slick, strongly flavored back end of bourbon flavor and soft heat. Nicely flavored in all the right places- surprisingly light drinking with a deceptively high ABV. The bourbon is very well integrated into this beer. 4.25 (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, moderately oily, lightly chewy, smooth, medium dry. Carbonation is modest, generating a medium frothiness and a mildly crisp finish. Body is medium for the style, heavy overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to earthy roast bitterness and bourbon alcohol. Alcohol presence is moderate and there are no off characters. 4.5 (Overall) Integrating bourbon into an already thoroughly enjoyable Imperial Stout does help complicate (for the better) the drinkability of this otherwise highly drinkable and nicely balanced Imperial Stout, graduating it to a more graceful, slower sipping beer, expected of a quality Imperial Stout. The subtleties of this beer are widespread, with the focus remaining equally on the chocolate and bourbon, this beer does not lose any of its focus. One of the prized annual releases in EvilTwin's lineup and worthy of seeking out whenever it comes into town. A marked and welcome improvement over Imperial Biscotti Break standard and certainly worth the extra couple of bucks. 4.25 Evil Twin Brewing's"
767,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.92,"Had a bottle at Toronado San Diego. A: a crisp looking ruby color, minimal head with very fine lacing. S: This scent would be extraordinary anywhere. Wish I didn't have to wash out the bottle. Fresh cherries up front with a nice wine-barrel undertone. T: Wow. Arguably one of the best sours I've ever had. Fantastic cherry flavors with some subtle citrus just to throw me off. Great profile blending with whatever wine barrels they used. MF/D: Incredibly smooth. Fortunately we didn't get a gusher, and the carbonation was faint, effervescent, and smooth. Can't wait to convince my friends to get another bottle!"
768,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.31,"I like it as a PB stout...definitely one of the better tasting substyle of milk/sweet stout. As a milk/sweet stout it does a good job as well. It's hard not to just C+P my review of Gunner's Daughter here because I think the two beers are that similar except for a couple alcohol percentage points and slightly thicker feel from HOTS.  A: Dark wood, burnt walnut...charcoal. Moderate-deep khaki foamline head. Very fizzy for a stout with lactose.  S: Earth, peanut shells, black dirt, fruity coffee, English toffee. M: Sweet and sticky with a slight drying edge.  T: Like eating a full Reese's cup after taking a shot of espresso, which i just did for comparison purposes. Overall, the chocolate is more enduring than chocolate. Red berry chocolate fruitiness counterbalances the earthy peanut. Dryness of the short espresso.  O: It's a good beer, but ranks behind pretty much every other stout I've had from TH. It's one of those beers that if I had access to routinely NBD, but not necessarily worth a repeat trip. Especially since Gunner's Daughter is such a good comp minus some sticky mouthfeel."
769,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.6,"Drank in a snifter on 8/26/2017 Look - pretty much pitch black, decent lacing, very little head, some flakes floating around that are either coconut or consistent bubbles. i say coconut. :) Smell - coconut potent for sure. nice milk chocolate, hint of vanilla and oak Taste - the balance here is incredible. All of the flavors are strong but also subtle at the same time. The Bomb! base comes through nicely too with a tasty hint of spice from the peppers. The rum barrel is so subtle that my dislike for rum barrels doesn't come into play while drinking this. Really incredible flavors. Feel - creamy for sure. Not overly thick, but a very nice and smooth mouthfeel. No booze whatsoever. Overall - lives up to the hype! All I can say here since this is an extremely hard beer to acquire. No disappointment whatsoever and may even chase again. Nice work Prarie!!!"
770,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.25,"Another day, another 50% off bomber (500ml ""Brewed July 17, 2016) from The Brass Tap here in Baltimore: drinkable motor oil w/a mocha head that unsurprisingly (given the ABV) doesn't last; mostly vanilla on the nose, more chocolate on the tongue (where's the coffee?); smooth despite the carbonation; would I do this at full price? Hell NO!"
771,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,5.0,"First time seeing it available around here, so “had to” pony up the money for a tiny 1 oz taste. The smell was literally filling the area around the bottle. Nose started like four feet away. Caramel notes, cologne. Color is rich, clear, rusty amber. First sip is boozy, reminds me of cognac, with a solid pitted fruit on the front, caramelly vanilla in back. It looks thin, but it’s actually very viscous and leaves some heavy legs. Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp, cleansing bite from the alcohol. It really is not like what one would think of as a traditional strong ale, but more a spirit / liquor. One ounce leaves one wanting more, but it was a real treat."
772,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.6,"Canned 10.23.19, opened 11.17.19 “It all goes away” Motor oil black liquid, solid two finger creamy brown foam cap, diminishes to a pencil thin solid layer after five minutes, great lacings Aroma of maple syrup,milk chocolate , fresh roasted coffee taste is maple, coffee, sweet smooth, low sudsing, sweetness lingers  great beer"
773,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.51,"July 27th, 2015 - Legendary and luxurious, I now get to have the Consecration fresh from the tap. Dark and with soda like bubbles on the edge, it gives off a power and luscious smell of sour cherries and candied apples, bright and beautiful. And the flavor gives much the same, with a perfect, perfect sourness and a perfect acidity. The flavor notes feature juicy bordeaux grapes and even a bit of sparkling grape juice. It's far better than it sounds, and absolutely lands the acidity."
774,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.34,"Bottle pour. Pink raspberry color. Pink hued white head. This one has a ton of fresh, tart raspberries and a huge raspberry seed flavor. A little jammy, but mainly tart with some sourness."
775,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.85,"L: Deep, dark purple hue with a nice amount of carb retention after the pour. Gorgeous."

777,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.39,"L: A pale murky yellow, with a slight greenish and warm orange tints. Two fingers of stark white sticky foam with great retention and some splotches and wide bands of lace on the glass. The lacing is really beautiful. S: Earthy papaya, and greener aromas such as green papaya and underripe pineapple. Both piney and peppery. T: Still insanely bitter on the palate, but the other flavors are quite soft in contrast. And wow that bitter dryness goes on and on. I do like it though. Most would not pound this back - it's a sipper. F: Smooth and mostly dry. Medium weight and decent carbonation. O: I rarely call anything too bitter. This one is pushing limits. Overall I don't think it's my favorite from TG, (that might be Scorpius Morchella) but it is a really nice drink, that I hope to repeat."
778,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.44,"A - Pours a lightly hazed amber with a two finger creamy white head. Heavy amount of soapy lacing. S - Aroma is tangerine, grapefruit rind, caramel and piney hops. T - The taste is tangerine, mango, grapefruit, caramel malts, toasted biscuit and piney hops. M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish. O - A classic DIPA."
779,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.41,"Batch #1 bottle from Toby. Silky black pour, flat. Roasty, sweet, chocolate boozy aroma. Taste gets better, smooth, velvety, warm. Hits all high marks."
780,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.22,"12oz bottle. I like how it says ""manifested on""... then the date. That's just cute (as my Granny would say). This beer is only 2 weeks old, part of the reason I grabbed it (not much better in the beer world than a fresh double citra IPA). So glad I grabbed this one once I looked it up and saw all the glowing reviews. It was also the last one on the shelf, which to me is always a good sign when shopping - finding very fresh beer that is almost sold out simply tells me that I've found good beer. Huge thanks / shouts to the guy that left 1 last 4-pack! This beer is SUPER HAZY. I mean, it's sitting there looking like a big golden milkshake with a gigantic pillowtop of creamy off-white head. The head was so thick and malleable it was like a lump of white jello sitting atop my beer. I won't even hesitate before calling it the greatest head I've ever seen on a beer. This is a fantastic brew just to sit and look at, completely a work of art here. It's a damn shame it doesn't smell better, the scent is nice, just muted. I have to dig to find that signature Citra 'stinky armpit' hop smell... The taste is nothing to write home about, either, but it is balanced very nicely with the surprisingly substantial malt presence, and the ABV is high but shows up only in how dry this one can be. This is definitely one dangerous beer sitting at 8.5% - it's like drinking a good pilsner, that's how smooth and easy it goes down Delicious beer from New Orleans, purchased and enjoyed in beautiful Fort Myers, Florida. Like most Citra bombs, this was freaking dank. Not the best Citra beer I've had, but it's definitely up there. I can't complain either, drinking this out by the water with my family. Times like those are what I live for, but the taste of this beer will forever be associated with that memory of this April the 20th spent with my Uncle, Grandmother, and Sister. Cheers to life! We only get so see each other so often and I love every minute of every visit. I savor it like a good beer... kinda like this good bier, in fact. I wish my dad were here too, life would be that much more awesome, but I'm learning it wasn't meant to be. I drink this one for him, though - I love you dad, I know you're awaiting us on that next big step that we all have to take some day, and I for one will be leaping with joy to join you on the other side. Cheers to all my fellow beer advocators as well the Alström Brothers: they made my favorite beer site ever, by a mile, and I've never cheers'd them on their own site - The Shame!!! So cheers Alström Brothers, and anyone who made it to the end of this review/diatribe - I owe you a beer. Love and Peace to all, it's what the world is made from"
781,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.66,"Bottle pour into a taster. Gorgeous beer! Huge, huge, huge tropical fruit, particularly passion fruit. One of the best berliners I've had a chance to try."
782,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.03,poured into a taster glass via draft at Other Half's Pastry Town (3/16/2019) color is motor oil black with tan foam smell is baker's chocolate and caramel taste is chocolate mixed in with subtle metallic..uggh low carbonation mouthfeel is full and sticky not sure if this was a bad batch or what..but the metallic taste overpowered everything and left a bad taste in my mouth (obviously)
783,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.16,"2018 vintage. Coffee is almost nonexistent. Either the base abraxas flavors over power the coffee, or the coffee died out quick. Still good, but to me does not live up to the name ""Coffee Abraxas"""

785,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.75,"A beautiful hazy golden orange color, the head is nearly perfect - a pearl white color, really dense and foamy, it literally creates a lace wall down the glass. Never seen anything like it. The nose is dank tropical aromas, especially grapefruit, pineapple, mango - and also some pine. Wow. I didn’t see that coming. The grapefruit is prominent on the taste, and it has a candied element that is absolutely magnificent. There’s also pineapple, mango, and the aforementioned pine. Perfectly balanced, with no hint whatsoever of the 8% ABV, this is an example of a brewery confident in their prowess with hops. The mouthfeel is really dry and substantial, as expected. What a treat this beer is. If you look in the “IPA Hall Of Fame,” this beer is one of the original inductees, IMHO."
786,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.74,"Love this blend. The cherry adds just enough tartness to balance out the sweet raspberries. Almost as enjoyable to look at as it is to drink. Smells of ripe fruit, feels light and clean. Just wonderful."
787,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,3.86,"16oz can Pours two big fingers of fluffy white head into my willi becher glass. Dissipates a little bit, bit half a finger hangs around for quite a while. Body is redundant at this point – juice. Overall looks good so far. It’s beginning to get very difficult to describe the differences between these NEIPA’s, they all smell so similar. Grapefruit, citrus dominate. Mild notes of dank/earthy hops in the background. Some sweetness muddling in here. Smells fine, I’m getting quite bored of drinking these though. Flavor is refreshing, dank, earthy, borderline dirty hops are most present. Light citrus, mango is most distinguishable. This is a good beer, still prefer a solid west coast though. Carbonation is light, body is medium-light. Bitterness is moderately low, and doesn’t linger, maybe one day we’ll all remember putting hops in our boil isn’t a bad thing. A little sweet, though it doesn’t coat my mouth. I don’t know why the carbonation is usually low in Trillium beers, would like something a little more effervescent. Mouthfeel overall is whatever, to style I guess, I want more character. Drinkability is good, it’s a tasty beer. Appearance turned out very nice, thick sheets of lacing coated the glass. Overall a fine NEIPA, I’ll try to leave it at that."
788,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.34,"Canned 2/18/21 It's funny, I had heard of this beer a few times here and there over the years, but it doesn't seem to be too widely discussed. When I picked it up at the store I figured I was just go for it. Little did I know that it currently sits at #240 of all time here of BA, which naturally drives my expectations up. Let's see if it can live up to this Pours a cloudy golden orange with 3 fingers of dense white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing In the nose, there's less of a malt presence than my favorite IIPA's, but it is still nicely balanced, more so balanced in terms of different hops expressions. I'm picking up on aromas of pine sap, pithy grapefruit, mango, orange zest, white pepper, lemon, a touch of honey, and light bready malt This bitters up even more in taste, but keeps it interesting while remaining classic at the same time. On the front of the sip I'm tasting pine sap, resiny hops, orange zest, and a touch of pale malt. The swallow brings notes of oily pine, white pepper, pale malt, and a touch pf lemon A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a crisp and refreshing beer. Finishes completely dry and bitter While this was quite good, I don't think it's as good as many make it out to be. That being said, I'd get it again in a heartbeat"
789,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.55,"Appearance: Poured viscous motor oil with a thin layer of tan head that disappeared quickly.  Smell: Immediate notes of Americano coffee. Very robust, rich, and assertive to the nose. Coffee gives off bitter cocoa and slight dried pitted fruit. Just slight hints of fragrant vanilla. Overall very warm and inviting.  Taste: Robust coffee from start to finish. Even the aftertaste remains rich in coffee, leaving a roasty bitterness in the mouth. It's interlaced with semi-sweet chocolate, making it almost dessert-like yet still contributing a slight char and bitterness. There is also hints of smoke and dried cherries, enhancing the complexity. Maybe just trace of vanilla, nothing more.  Mouthfeel: full-bodied, rich, and silky.  Overall: A solid beer that really showcases quality coffee. Vanilla was pretty minimal but the coffee makes up for it."
790,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.52,"Had this in August, then the 2016 version, + have tasted a few vintages before. Incredible solid imperial stout from the Floridian masters here! Super RIS"
791,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.52,"Batch #1. Poured a hazed golden yellow color with a bubbly, white head of foam. It smelled funky with strong lemon notes. Nice sour lemon taste with a good dose of acidity."
792,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.68,"Earthy, wonderfully tart and lightly sour, funky - beautiful pour, lightly effervescent and carbonated. The grapes are pungent and rich in the mouth. This bottle was a complete surprise at a friend's share - I hadn't even recalled this was on my wish list. It's a great pleasure to tick this one - I think that Fou Foune may still be my ""regular"" favorite, but St. Lam is tremendous."
793,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.5,"Pours deep black with quite a bit of carbination. Aroma is sweetness of chocolate and milk. Tastes every sweeter with chocolate, milk, vanilla and some caramel. Medium bodied. An incredible stout."
794,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.49,"Enjoyed after a nice rest in the cellar. Complex melange of aromas and taste - sour mash, oak, vinous grapes, dark fruit, puckering green apple and candied fruit. Fruit acids, wine tannins, oak, bourbon starches and sugars - pleasantly tart and incredibly smooth. Hints of a well made manhattan.  No heat or zap from the ABV. Easy to drink and enjoy; nowhere near enamel stripping or harsh. A true beauty."
795,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.75,"2020. Excellent BCBS year. The balance on this years OG is excellent. You get bourbon, oak, chocolate. The chocolate really comes on strong after the finish well after drinking."

798,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,3.59,"2-month-old can poured into a tulip. Has to be said: absolutely awesome can art. Murky but pretty dark-orange-gold body with borderline-turbid haze. Huge, fluffy head of tightly compact off-white bubbles. Excellent retention and remarkable lacing. Based on the ultra-high ratings for this beer, I'm guessing that the age on the can I'm drinking has taken a lot away from the aromas and flavors. But I have to base my ratings on what I'm actually consuming, and in that respect this is a solid but fairly average hazy IPA. Aroma profile is malt-heavy, dank a grassy, with subdued tropical fruit and citrus juice notes. A little white wine, some herbal greenery, and a touch of oxidation. Flavors follow, as cracked wheat, lemongrass, damp grass, and pine resin are what's most noticeable, with citrus and stone fruit coming in the second wave. A little dry white wine and a fairly dry, bitter finish. The hops in this one have to have fallen off considerably, and a metallic note adds more hints at oxidation. Wet cardboard and not much juice. Just really not very good. Feel is in line with the look: extremely silky and soft and quite substantial for a 6% beer. Not sticky or boozy at all. I assume a fresh version of this beer is much better than what I drank. That's a shame."
799,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.43,"Poured a bright hazy yellow color with a fragile foamy white head that disappeared quickly. There were extravagant aromas of Brett, white grapes, subtle citrus, with yeasty overtones. Very fruity and aromatic. The flavors are likewise the same, very fruity with yeasty overtones. Plenty of white grapes around the mouth with some Brett and subtle citrus and perhaps pitted fruit. The flavors come without any restraint. Its like opening up this bottle released its potency. The mouthfeel was not harsh, it was quit pleasant, smooth, and light bodied. Overall exceptional beer, the flavors where spot on, again extravagant without being overwhelming. I could drink this again and again if I only I had easy access to this beer."
800,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.4,"On tap at the brewery. Smell and taste are great and hoppy, resinous, tropical and citrus rind."
801,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.6,"2016 Vintage 750ml corked and caged bittle - poured into a Riesling/Zinfandel stem at 45°F. Pours a slightly foggy translucent honey-golden, really verging on orange, like a West Coast IPA. A finger of coarse, sticky, sudsy off-white head forms, with fair retention, and settling to a decent collar, with weak, spotty lacing. Clings to the glass like whiskey. Really a beautiful beer. Nose: This one travels. No shortage of funk here. Tons of damp hay and wine-soaked oak, with plenty of bright lemon juice and rind. There's ample leather book binding, dusty stone cellar, petrichor, magnolia blossom, and a really dense note of patchouli, with some sweet apricot and marmalade threadinf through. Some funky stable, sea shell minerality, and sweaty brett emerge, but the funk is balanced by plenty of bright fruitiness. Huge nod to Cantillon here. Palate: Duck Duck Gooze emerges with an impressively balanced acidity. Like biting into a ripe stone fruit, there's a bright *POP* of tartness, but it immediately steps back, becoming more of a lemony tang. Lemon oil, orange juice, apricot, and crabapple lend bright fruity notes, with undertones of cabernet grape, cranberry, unripe plum, and coriander seed. The tartness begins to rapidly subside, showing quite a bit of grain - dusty, with hulls. An almost Gueuze level of funk presents itself in the form of wet hay, damp wood, old musty stable air, milkweed, and a touch of herbal flowery notes with just a whisper of sweaty funk. The tartness completely disappears, and the finish shows wheaty grain, grass, lemon essence, white oak, and just a touch of grapefruit oil that clings to the palate. Mouthfeel/Body: Absolutely stunning. It's crisp, airy, and quenchingly dry with a shimmering minerality, but there's definitely some soft body which lends presence. The effervescence is truly perfect. Champagne. Zippy, airy, fluffy, and fizzy, but soft and supple. An oily feel lingers. Overall: This is perhaps the most stunning American wild ale I've had in a long time, perhaps ever. I'm not sure if this is Method Traditionelle or not, but either way, this really is a masterpiece. A sweet grain presence, incredibly balanced acidity, ample funk contrasting against beautiful bright fruity notes, and it all comes together so seamlessly and flawlessly, this has truly transcended the style itself. Simply stunning."
802,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.75,"One of my all-time wants. Glad to finally try -- thanks James. Had back to back with Anna and you could really see the refinement. This is the sophisticated big sister with all the sharp edges smoothed off. Lovely, vinous and soft. This is definitely worthy of its top tier status. I would likely go with Sarrasin as the best HF saison, but this is right there. Phenomenal beer."
803,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.55,"from the cask over at the cellar, my golly this is incredible. more intensely flavored and i think more dynamic than either of the coffee variants i have had of this one, and frankly one of the better coconut stouts i have ever come across. the cask pour obviously favors a beer like this, frothy, at perfect temperature, and with an even more silky texture that i think adds to the allure, but the beer is insane regardless of the format. the coconut is definitely toasted, it has that warming, baked, nutty an sweet quality to it, really strongly dosed but also extremely natural, a new benchmark for natural coconut aroma and flavor for sure in one of these. its got just the right amount of sweetness in it, and it brings a chocolate covered sort of vibe out of the malt, both dark and milk, roasty and rich at the same time, and while this is assuredly bitter from the malt at the end, it is far less so than the coffee variants were, just mellow, almost oak aged taste to the finish from the grain. so much body but its pillowy soft, starchy and heavy but also relaxing and creamy and awesome, the perfect feel for these flavors. coconut gets more toasty and earthy later on, and it ramps up with the booze as the temperature rises and it opens up awhile in the glass. an enormously impressive and delicious beer, incredible amounts of coconut to this, scary drinkable for its strength, and just a monument to quality. among the best of the shared beers i have had to date!"
804,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.18,"A: loads of maple syrup and coffee, chocolate, molasses, and vanilla. Very smooth and balanced A: black with medium brown head.  F: smooth coffee, coffee, and coffee. With maple and vanilla. Chocolate and molasses follow just like the nose.  M: medium to full body with balanced finish. Lingering maple and coffee and maybe a hint if the bacon on the background  O: very good and unexpected. I wouldn’t notice bacon in this unless it was suggested but then it shows up."
805,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.9,"After 500+ stouts, this one is easily top 5. A bar to measure all other BA adjunct stouts (for me). Everything is spot on. Sweet-but-not-too-sweet, super balanced adjuncts, barrel-but-not-too-much-barrel, thick-but-not-THICC, etc."
806,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.51,12oz bottle. 2017 bottling (10/05/017).
807,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.0,"Pours a dark brown with tan head. It smells of intense coffee. No bitterness at all to this. Just fudgey chocolate and coffee. Smooth as hell. It's very approachable in the way that every Tree House is approachable. This no doubt tastes great and is super smooth, but it is also the type of coffee stout that people who don't drink coffee stouts would like. It's not super complex and has one note of those three flavors. UPDATE: This oxidizes fairly quickly."
808,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.28,"This is another of Founders recent releases that is worth the price! This beer makes me marvel at the combination of taste, feel, and smell.  It pours perfectly, it smells heavenly, and the taste is awesome from first touch to the lips to the swallow and retro-hale."
809,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.71,Black thick beer poured into a snifter. Minimal carbonation. Lots of chocolate raspberry on the nose. Bourbon followed by the sourness of the raspberry but wonderful balance. A little thin on the mouthfeel but minimally
810,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.2,"Poured a black body with dark tan head that quickly died with minimal lace ring. Smell is basically chocolate and that's not a bad thing. Smooth, creamy, tastes like chocolate icing off the top of a cupcake with a milky slickness as well. ABV is well-hidden in this slightly bready/chewy beer that is basically heaven for anyone with a sweet tooth, but not cloying and enjoyable for anyone who just likes a good sweet stout."
811,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.1,"Big fan of Perennial and their stouts. I like the vanilla and coffee variants more, but this one is great. Just enough cinnamon to smell/taste but not overpowering."
812,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.47,12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Opaque dark brown with a thin tan head.
813,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.43,"12 oz can: This one pours a hazy darker orangish golden color. A wisp of a white head and almost no lacing. Good nose. Resinous pine, citrus and tropical hop notes. The taste is very good. Somewhat bitter with an underlying thicker sweetness. Resinous pine, citrus and tropical flavors. Maybe some honey and biscuit also. Very nice."
814,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.57,"Definitely don't get to drink Cantillon as often as I would like and when I do, its usually a treat. This was no exception; a solid gueuze that was enjoyable from start to finish."
815,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.9,"This is one outstanding variant of the original. Pours black, and the maple shows itself upon olfactory inspection. Taste is just incredible. While the maple is the main attractions, there are hints of the other flavors, and I love how the heat doesn't kick in until the end. Better than the original in my opinion."
816,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.52,Aged for 2 years in the bottle. Dark amber appearance with slight off white head. Aroma is a nice standard barleywine. Taste is also a standard very smooth rich barleywine.
817,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.5,Nice funky beer. Side project is an awesome brewery. This review is for batch #3. Nice funky smell and taste. A glorious saison no fruit necessary. amazing job.
818,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.76,"12 October 2020 - Beer #195 - BA Top 250 Alert! Acquired via trade Appearance: 5 - completely black. No head, but tremendous lacing. Nose: 4 - all barrel, basically no adjuncts. Taste: 5 - yeah, not quite all barrel, but it dominates. The coconut and vanilla are there, but complementary. Mouth: 5 - thick and smooth. Sticks around for a long while. I'll need to brush extra tonight. Overall: 5 - better than the bourbon version. Truly world class. Cheers!"
819,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.6,"Perrin No Rules 2018 Imperial BBA Porter, 15% ABV. Pours black with a ring of bubbles. Nose is coconut, chocolate, and brown sugar. Taste is quite sweet brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, bourbon, and coconut, with no bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, overall world-class."
820,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.98,This was absolutely incredible. Probably the best sour I've ever had. So much raspberry across the whole beer. This feels pretty much like having raspberry juice.
821,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.4,"On tap. Nearly black brown, no head. Smell is coconut, chocolate, and vanilla. It smells like a liquid almond joy. Booze is very noticeable. Taste is incredibly rich vanilla, coconut, milk chocolate, bourbon, and a second wave of coconut on the finish. Feel is absolutely incredible— thick, silky and viscous. It’s like drinking melted chocolate. A pronounced alcohol warmth seals the deal. Make no mistake, this is an incredible beer, but the bourbon finish is almost so rich that it’s a bit unbalanced. Other than that, nearly perfect feel, wonderful smell, and great taste."
822,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.42,"Poured at pretty close to fridge temp. Look is ruby red with slight transparency. Nose is deep and complex. Raspberries, sweet candy. Taste is WOW. So fruit forward. Almost like straight squeezed juice. No alcohol presence. Dry and sticky, with tart raspberries. Good level of sourness. Overall, this was amazing."
823,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.66,"2/28/2018 bottle shared with 5 others. Poured into a tulip glass. Poured a clear golden color with a bubbly, effervescent white head that lingered. Aromas of funk, oak, hay and subtle acidity fill my nose. Not much of a farmhouse aroma here as I feel like the barrel aging did away with that. Taste is divine. Tart, oaky, subtle acidity in the finish. Muted layers of farmhouse here but not very prevalent. Feel is light and bubbly. Almost champagne like. Damn good. Overall, this is an outstanding brew. HF already makes world class non BA saisons and when you toss them into a barrel, they elevate to a whole new level."
824,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.35,"This beer pours a cloudy, deep golden orange color with a creamy, frothy, bright white head. Retention is excellent and there are many webs and rings of lacing left on the glass. Smell is grapefruit, herbal earthiness, lemon, tangerine and mango. Taste follows suit, but the fruit mixed with the herbal, earthiness and bitterness seems to get muddled a little bit. It is still very good, but not as robust as the smell suggested. Feel is light and crisp with a dry finish. There is a slight stickiness on the finish as well from the hop oils. Overall this is a very good beer. Not my favorite version of Fort Point, but still very enjoyable."
825,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.62,"Another beer courtesy of  Firestone Walker  Stickee Monkee Vintage 2017 Look: The beer pours black. A finger of beige head settles to a thin layer across the top of the glass. The beer is opaque and there is no visible carbonation. A couple spots of lacing but nothing to really speak of. As I drink the beer down the light brings out some ruby and burnt sienna tones.  Smell: First and foremost, dark, dried fruit. The soft sweetness of dates, followed by a hint of raisin. Vanilla and toasted coconut. Caramel, toffee, fudge. My Mom makes a toffee bar with walnuts for Christmas. The aroma of this beer reminds of that dessert treat. Soft alcohol presence.  Taste: Mmmm this is so good. It’s not a terribly complex beer, but the flavor profile is banging. Dark, dried fruit, mostly dates.m with a hint of raisin. Again, caramel and toffee. A marshmallow sweetness. Super smooth. Amazingly so at 12.5%.  Feel: A super smooth and velvety beer with low carbonation. Some warmth on the finish which nicely complements the flavors noted above. Stickee residual sugar on my lips.  Overall: I do not have the advantage of comparing this beer to its fresh self. While I cannot attest to the impact of age on this beer, I can say that this beer was properly cellared. No off flavors. Nice carbonation. Had I stashed these away I’d continue drinking them in the future, based on this experience. This beer is a real treat. As with virtually every spirit barrel aged beer from FW that I’ve had, the beer and the barrel treatment are nuanced. This beer is no exception. And it lands near the top of my list for BA beers from FW.  Dark Belgian beers, especially those aged in spirit barrels and some of my favorite beers, so I’m not surprised, based on the style and maker, that I love this beer.  I will post this in the cellar review thread too."
826,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.19,"My first HF Flora variant. And while I'm admittedly not that big into plums, I still found this to be an enjoyable brew. I'm glad I had this during summer, it was very refreshing."
827,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.52,Big thanks to Dimidiata for this
828,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.78,"What else can you say about this? Lively, funky, bright, full flavored, complex, refreshing... This is a great sour ale with a beautiful amber russet color. Carbonation is moderate and provides nice effervescence. The taste follows the nose perfectly with currant and bretty funkiness. So easy to drink at 10% abv. No real rough edges here. An excellent beer that few would find controversial."
829,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.2,"Foggy burnt gold with a fizzy off-white head settling to a thin chain in no time leaving a bubbling but clear surface. Having this side by side with La Fosse, Smooth is less sour yet also less sweet. There's more oak and more funk here, both in a barnyard, hay and blue cheese direction, as well as a mineral and ditch water character, but not in a bad way. There is a mature white wine tartness via the crisp medium-light body. The finish is semi-dry, bringing out a little tart lemon and green apple."
830,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.56,"2019, 375ml. Poured a deep hazy, purple-red color. The nose is fruity and funky. So funky it can start to smell like a bleu cheese. Taste is blueberry, with barn funk and had hay. The blueberry is light but not subdued. It plays well with the signature Cantillon funk. Mouth feel is light and perfectly carbonated. Overall, it was incredible and worth the hype. Cantillon makes plenty of great beers and Blabaer is among the top."
831,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.33,The beer pours a foamy and heavy head with a light brown note to it. The beer itself is a dark brown color that is opaque and looks very nice.
832,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.34,"Poured into a snifter. An opaque bark brown color with a thin dark tan head. Little retention and lacing. A big whiff of chocolate and vanilla on the first sniff. Some bourbon and roasted malt. The taste followed with sweet vanilla, chocolate, candied sugar, and whisky. A very thick, viscous drink. Well-balanced but heavy and sweet. Definitely a sipper with friends. Great brew."
833,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,3.74,"Pours a clouded amber-orange color, with a froth, stable head. Smells of yogurt, orange sorbet and fresh cut apricots. Got a unique funk profile to it, which leads to a apricot stone pit quality among wet earth and moldy wood. While this is pretty fruit centered, it leaves enough space on the palate for the funk to play an important role on the aromas, as it sets the state of the fruits somewhere between wet and juicy. Has a soft, lighter mouthfeel, with a well nuanced, sparkly effervescence during the beers finish.  Tastes of an initial bread dough softness, which turns more mineralic, once the carbonation becomes recognizable, which also brings the fruits to the palate. Turns quite acidic then, making the beer utmost sour with an almost calming presence of unripe apricots. The apricots take a sweet turn then, developing a sudden, utmost pleasant ripeness, which blends perfectly into cream cheese and leather. Develops a late yogurt funk note with a sparkly rock licking impression, turning the fruits a little younger again, with a late, funky sourness.  This is solid with a slightly more pronounced fruity- and sourness. Lacks depth apart from that, while its sourness is too pronounced."
834,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.93,This beer is outstanding. Pours dark black with a thin tan head. Smells of light bourbon with strong maple. Nice sweet upfront maple with a wonderful chili finish. It is warm on the palate but not too much. Fabulous beer
835,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,5.0,"ASMR feelings in head and spine when I drank this (not just tingling sensation, but a cascading release of dopamine)...I think that speaks for itself. This is undoubtedly the best beer I have ever had. Canned on March 18th; drank on March 18th."
836,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.94,"B3. Massive oak, funk, tart, acidic, rustic lambic/gueuze. Dark golden oaky appearance, long lasting head, and delicate lacing. Lemon and grapefruit rind lingers on the palate. Full bodied acidic mouth feel. So satisfying!"
837,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.75,"This beer reminds me a lot of what old school (pre-2015) barrel-aged stouts from Cigar City Brewing used to taste like. Excellent use of adjuncts, highly viscous mouthfeel, and a great chocolatey finish. A fantastic beer."
838,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,5.0,"2020 vintage marked on label. Drink by 22JUN25 printed on bottom of back label, so I've got 4 years to finish it. Bottle picked up at liquor store for $10.99. Poured into Duvel tulip. Appearance - Absolutely pitch black body; not even a single ray of light passes through, even with a phone's flashlight held touching the glass on the backside. Fine lacing with a fine and even stick. Bottle says to enjoy in a snifter -- close enough. 5 Smell - Strong alcohol at first, but still alluring because of the dark roasted character. Almost a little winey. Perhaps little too sharp at first, but mellows and rounds out to perfection after a couple minutes in the glass. 5 Taste - Amazing balance. Was expecting something as sharp as the nose suggests it would be, but it's actually much more smooth. Sure, there's a lot of alcohol up front, along with dark smoky malt and even some lighter, sweeter fruit and vinousness. That bourbon comes in smooth. This is almost like a barelywine without the harshness. 5 Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. Warm and gets even warmer in the back of the throat and chest as well. 5 Overall - Delicious. Deserves its best in class score for its style. Not exactly as delicious as a KBS or CBS but has no faults to speak of, and a lot of strengths going for it. 5"
839,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.52,"750 ml poured into a teku at a share.  Look is golden orange. In the glass, it resembles the color of an apricot. Really great looking beer. Minimal head, no lacing and good carb.  Aroma is of fresh apricots followed by some funkiness. Really smells great.  Taste is very apricot prevalent with funk and tartness bringing up the rear. Super balanced as nothing overpowers. Also, where's the 8%? This drinks like something half the abv.  Feel is light and bubbly as you'd expect for this style.  Overall, another fantastic SP fruited saison. They do them right and this AdF is no exception."
840,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.49,"Pours a dark brown color with full head. Scent is of bourbon, chocolate malt and sugar. Taste follows, and is surprisingly sweet and fudgey. Full mouthfeel and an aftertaste combining coffee and chocolate/fudge"
841,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.16,"2017 vintage, bottled on 10/05/17. Purchased at Loosa Brews, Tuscaloosa, AL. Dark, murky pour, without too much viscosity but a great-looking stout poured from the bottle. A decent amount of beige head rises and settles in a good sized ring around the inside of the glass. Tons of dark chocolate and dried fruit on the nose that swirl around a backbone of oaky booze and roasty malt. Really a little bit of everything you could ask for of the style in the aromas, with the essence only intensifying as it warms. Distinctly different from the nose, a good compliment. Roasty espresso, caramel, and bitter baker's chocolate flavors, with a potent booziness that laces its way through the palate and lingers along with a predominant malt in the finish. I would have hoped only for a touch more sweetness to cut through that potent booze and bitterness, but it's not at all intended to take away from the overall pleasant experience. The body is fairly thin, retaining a good amount of carbonation that I feel like could even have been a little softer. Sticky, with a good residual mouth-coating and warm, boozy finish."
842,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.95,"Poured from a first batch bottle into an Avery rare beer snifter. Straight up coconut on the nose. Absolutely no trace of the promised 14.5%. Taste is coconut as well; finally, a coconut beer that delivers! As it warms up, the coconut gives way to the underlying barrel, making for a wonderfully balanced barrel-aged beer: not too sweet, but undeniably barrel-aged at length. Only complaint is that it doesn't come in a 750ml format. Love it."
843,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.43,"THREE FLOYDS PERMANENT FUNERAL DIPA 10/23/20 Only just recently made available in my New England state.  Poured from the 16 oz. can into an English nonick pint. a: Clear amber with an inch thick white head which receded slowly to thick surface foam and dense lacing. s: Fresh pine resin. t: Moderate pine resin with strength. No shortage of hop bitterness on the dry finish. m: Smooth almost chewy medium, great body with plenty of obvious carbonation tingle. o: An exceptional and powerful DIPA with lots of flavor covering most of its high ABV. Probably won't find much availability here in future but at the moment it surpasses my old favorite Lagunitas Brown Shugga as well as most non-NE style DIPAs I have had."
844,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.44,"2020 bottle.Pours into a snifter jet black with half finger mocha colored head that came together late,a broken ring of lace is left in its wake.Chocolate and mild smoldering ancho chili in the nose,cinnamon comes into play more as it warms.Cinnamon and that ancho spicy raisin note up front on the palate followed by some vanilla, graham cracker-like sweetness, and lightly sweetened cocoa, and mild sharpness from the cinnamon.So much going on but it never gets to be too big or too much,awesome!"
845,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.9,"Near black, brown edges, decent initial heads that fades to none with no lacing. Delicious blend of bourbon, coffee, molasses, anise in the nose Coffee, malt, bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate. Yes. Mouthfeel smooth. I'm a sucker for beers like this, but this was great."
846,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.51,"Appearance - Pours jet black with big fluffy mocha colored head that leaves tons of lacing all around the glass. Aroma - Big coffee, roasted malt, char, rich milk chocolate, light vanilla, very bold and rich. Taste - good bit more smoke on the taste than the nose, coffee, roasted malts, decadent chocolate flavor it is almost like a smoked chocolate dessert. light vanilla on the finish the roastiness carries on and on. Feel - Big full creamy mouthfeel slick oily nice dry finish. Overall - Just an amazing porter not sure I have had one with this much roast and nuttiness. Excellent full mouthfeel."
847,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.5,"Pungently funky with very light fruit notes. Vintage 2013. Pours quite surprisingly clear, pale pink-orange. Taste notes are quite light, carbonation is much like champagne. Not exactly the revelation that I'd expected, but it's still quite good. Still trying to land myself a framboise - very excited about that beer."
848,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.58,"Jet black beer in a glass. Small tan head.  Sweet vanilla booze, chocolate, lots of dark fruit, coffee on the nose and taste.  Only complaint which is a minor one is the mouthfeel. An absolute stunner of a stout although.  2016 version"
849,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.51,"I received 2 bottles from @roguer in the NBS BIF #13. Poured into a stout glass at 54 degrees. It pours nearly ink black with a half finger of creamy, light mocha-colored head and a generous sheen of creamy lacing. Its fragrant nose features roasted malt, maple syrup, toffee, freshly-brewed coffee, and a whiff of molasses. Oh. wow! It's like eating pancakes with maple syrup and drinking a good cup of coffee in a favorite diner. It's nutty and roasty and the coffee provides an acidic bitterness that balances the sweetness of the maple syrup. There are notes of toffee, fudge, tobacco, and earthy char. There's no real taste of bacon but the depth of the flavors trigger the imagination. What's truly amazing is the mouth feel. For a 6.4% Porter the mouth feel is amazingly thick and creamy. It's like drinking an imperial stout. It's moderately carbonated and really drinks easily. Overall, I now understand why so many BAs love this Porter. It causes sensory overload. Just superb!"
850,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.54,"Poured from a bomber bottle into a Duvel glass. L - Deep brown color like motor oil, with no light allowed through. Medium brown colored head is thick and moussey when poured, like a dollop of brown whipped cream. It fades slowly to a thick ring around the glass and massive sheets of lacing.  S - Massive aromas of coffee and chocolate, backed up by strong roasted, almost burnt grains. This version is not barrel aged, but there is enough alcohol aroma that blends with the other aromas to almost make you think there is whiskey in there.  T - Espresso, chocolate, burnt grain, smoke. Alcohol sweetness mid-palate, followed by an off-dry finish. F - Thick body with a silky, slightly oily feel. Low to moderate carbonation. Strong hops bitterness combines with burnt grain astringency. Big alcohol presence, but not overly hot. O - This is a massive stout that still manages to show off subtle flavors and aromas. Maybe the most complex non-barrel-aged imperial stout I've tried. I hope to be able to sample some of the barrel-aged versions of this beer."
851,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.39,"Appearance - The beer poured a murky black color with a dark tan head crowning the glass.  Smell - The sweet nose of vanilla and chocolate cakealmost reaches the level of children’s breakfast cereal. But then there is the bourbon. There is no bourbon in children’s breakfast cereal.  Taste - The bourbon leads the taste, with bold notes of chocolate, vanilla, and even a hint of coconut. Black licorice notes were also detectable at times. In the aftertaste, the sweetness of the vanilla stands out among the continuing flavors.  Mouthfeel - The stout was slick with sweetness without the need for gobs of lactose sugar.  Overall - I may like the sweetness of the non-BA version better, but this is very solid."
852,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.56,"Late check-in from notes b4  Pours a dark brown chocolate with a tan head.  Nose of dried fruit, barrel, chocolate, toffee/molasses, and leather  Taste follows dark chocolate, leather, dried dark fruit, barrel, mild heat  Feel is full bodied, minimal carb Overall, best american barelywine I have had - especially fresh. No direct hop notes/bitterness shines through. It is a rich Barleywine best shared with friends"
853,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.95,"Absolutely beautiful Kriek. Brick red pour, no head, perfume of earth, cherries, and blue cheese. As it opens up, aromas of tea tree and mint take over. I am humbled by this! The taste is earthy and tart, the fruit doesn't overwhelm."
854,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.67,"I’ve had better offerings from other half. This is sort-of a simple, sweet-base one dimensional — albeit tasty — beer. I get that it’s a DDH all citra juice bomb. And that’s cool. I like it fine. Just that a beer with these kind of reviews I expected more. Maybe the reviews are pre-craft-beer revolution. Cuz if I had this beer 5 years ago I would have been dumbfounded!"
855,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.5,"Pours black with a finger and a half of caramel-mocca colored foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is coffee and cinnamon right on the nose. Coffee is roasty with the cinnamon adding a little spicy dryness. Toffee, caramel and chocolate add sweetness with roasty, toasty and nutty malts adding adding base and depth. Flavor profile is all the same - rich chocolate laced with a blend of roasty coffee and dry cinnamon. Toffee, molasses and chocolate add further sweetness, but only just a little squeeze. Roasty, toasty and nutty malts add the base. Wow. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety texture is chewy. Overall, dense and loaded with coffee & cinnamon for a delightful and special treat. Depth is tremendous, extending this treat past the superficial layer.  Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 22oz bottle."
856,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.3,"2019 Vintage Pours an inky black body with faint reddish/brown edges topped with ⅓ of a finger of dark khaki foam barely having the chance to form before transitioning to a sizable, soapy collar; the occasional strand of tightly composed lacing holds tenuously to the glass. Aromas are strong with notes of brown sugar, oatmeal raisin cookie, milk chocolate, and walnuts upfront, with a firm dried chile powder middle; a backing of well-attenuated mild earthy pepper courses throughout, while touches of vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel, and bourbon-soaked oak quietly come into their own. Decadent but not overbearing, and approachably complex. Taste profile opens with heavy doses of chocolate fudge, milk chocolate cacao, vanilla and smooth, very slightly smoky bourbon-tinged caramel and toffee; peppery spice builds to a very mild underlying herbal heat, lasting through a nutty, chocolatey swallow. Mouthfeel shows a medium body with low carbonation; a building peppery heat is tingly and spread along the palate, while the back end becomes slightly sticky/slick into the finish, but dries steadily through the swallow; minimal-no alcohol presence. An impressive, peppery stout which shows surprising balance between its punchier notes; in spite of the barrel-aged component, it is not bourbon-forward, yet the barrel is spectacularly integrated into every seam of the beer and doing well to temper the heat. The resulting disparate elements thus all find their place within the profile effortlessly, and leave this drinker, normally opposed to spice in his stout, a willing convert (at least in this case)."
857,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.6,"Bomber. Pours black with thin tan head, fades to a ring that lasts. Incredible aroma, vanilla and bourbon and coffee. Bourbon vanilla chocolate shake taste, with some more bourbon. Flavors blend together seamlessly. While boozy, this brew has a ton of flavor, bittersweet chocolate and vanilla finishes it off. Medium slick feel. This one lives up to the hype, well done."
858,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.85,Pours a thick black color with minimal head. Smells of dark chocolate and bourbon. Incredibly smooth taste with chocolate and vanilla and smooth bourbon. Nice thick mouth feel. Unbelievable beer.
859,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.21,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a snifter. Look- Frothy medium brown head, black, above average lacing, average head retention. Smell- Bourbon, vanilla, oak. Taste- Bourbon, toasted oats, vanilla, ginger. Feel- Between thin and medium body, prickly, mouth warming, average carbonation. Overall- Nice beer or a snowy February day."
860,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.54,"this has been a beer ive wanted to get into for a really long time, i know it changes from blend to blend, but i was able to have the 2017 vintage that has some honey in it recently, i believe the first time golden blend has contained honey, and there is a cute little bee on the label to designate this vintage, still comprised of 25% 4 year lambic. its incredibly effervescent in the glass to my surprise, fizzy like a soda, and even has some lemon and lime soda aromatics to it. i get the floral polleny raw honey element in the nose as well, not sweet, but obviously and distinctively honey to me, with a very mature lambic character, wheaty, more puckery than some others i have had from these guys, and with a great musty danky funk to it as well, bright and woody at the same time, musty and fresh at the same time, earthy and clean at the same time, its crazy stuff! for how little honey is actually in here, i am surprised how well i can taste it through the layers of various lambics in this blend, i get a nice acidic pop up front and at the end, with a more wheaty malty middle and some decaying oak, vanilla, orange zest, green apple, champagne, and wet grass in the morning. the integration of the different vintages is awesome, and the sort of concentrated funkiness from the old lambic is really evident. this really is an amazing expression of their fermentation profile, more distinctive here than in any other of their beers i have had. i know this one is pretty new, but i love what the honey does to it. it makes me that much more excited to open the super old one that exists in my cellar..."
861,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.48,"Nothing to say that hasn’t already been said. Maple, Coffee, Batter. Just a touch thin. Noticed during my beer flight that GN loves a more bubbly approach to their beers. All have been a touch thinner, more effervescent, than expected."
862,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.21,"I've had this bottle on my wish list for a while - probably since the first time I tried Abraxas. I'd hoped it might be similar, or even better. Mexican Brunch isn't exactly what I'd hoped, but it does have a very pleasant balance - the chilis are mild, while the nibs have more of a baker's chocolate quality - not too cloying, not too sweet, not too spicy. It's quite pleasant - I certainly prefer Abraxas, but this is a very nice beer as well. I appreciate that the carbonation isn't super aggressive - it's very easy-drinking."
863,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.26,"It certainly had a lot of flavor, and it is a very good stout, but I thought it was too sweet. Look: Black with a thin mocca colored head Aroma: The aroma is very nice like a rum cake with raisins and chocolate, pepper and cinnamon. Flavor: The flavor is chocolate, cinnamon and sugar, some pepper, and maybe vanilla, and a hint of bourbon and tequila. It is both very good and very complex but a bit too sweet. Feel: It is fairly thick and viscous, but not as thick as some other imperial stouts I've had."
864,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,5.0,"2017 release. Drank on 10/16/2017 out of belgian style tulip. Look: poured black with small, foamy head. no overflow after opened like many others experienced with these release. Smell: cinnamon, coffee, maple, cocoa. great smell on this one. Taste: cinnamon comes through first and fades into coffee/chocolate, then some maple sweetness. the chile pepper came through but was hard to pick out over the cinnamon.  Feel: classic light/med body porter, nice and light but not thin in mouthfeel. Overall: this is a great beer if you can get your hands on it, this gets extra points because Kane refunded all the money because a few people experienced overflows after opening. Great action by a great brewery. Def a personal favorite, and def a favorite from my home state."
865,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.5,Bottle from 2015 A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a dense and rocky finger of light tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
866,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.5,"2018 vintage, drank 8/1/2019. Pours orange with a bit of suspended matter. Tons of funk to the nose and taste. Quite sour and acetic. I for some reason had been expecting a kriek - but this is quite good all the same. I'd love to try an aged bottle."
867,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.74,"Almost to good, the flavors were all there and none of those were really overpowering the other. But the presence of all those wonderful flavors pushed the stout into the back just a little to much. I am just nagging though, I felt really privileged for being able to enjoy this beer."
868,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.31,"Slick oily black with a seemingly headless, smooth silky surface that slowly develops a thin mocha film and a bubbly collar. The aroma of spiked dark mocha pairs well with the charred oak and sophisticated bourbon that comes with the excellent aging Hill Farmstead has done here. Fire roasted marshmallow and vanilla add a new level of decadence, while some spiced, dusty cinnamon emerges as it warms. Unbelievably deep, complex and luscious flavors of toasted coconut and nougatty yet dry and charred roasty wood mingle with some spicy, black peppery bourbon, while the cacao and cinnamon come out as light accents on the back end, with mocha becoming more apparent at room temperature. Slick, smooth and round, the carbonation serves to thin it out a bit with a crisp sort of crunchiness, as the swallow becomes a little warm and then sharply dry. Jesus Christ do they really know how to improve their base beers with bourbon barrel aging--I'm not sure any other brewery does it this well. I didn't really like Geneaolgy, yet found GoM to be great. The same was true for Twilight of the Idols, yet this was a complete knockout for me. Normally my preferences are often the opposite at other breweries, so major props, yet again, to HF."
869,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.51,"Been trying to get my hands on this since trying double Citra. Very good brew but personally would still rather double Citra (probably due to my hop preference) Nose: Dank Weed, Earthy Pine, Some lemongrass, Strong Juicy Citrus mixed in Taste: Dank Piff, Followed by smooth refreshing citrus, orange, some lemon, but the Dankness is the focus Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied with good carbonation to give this beer good Drinkability. A great summer pool beer, even though this is 8% 12 oz cans make it easier to pace yourself ;)"
870,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.23,"L - 1-finger sparse bright white head atop a milky orange body. S - tangerine, pineapple, herb, grapefruit. Yes! T - very tropical. More tangerine, pineapple, and grapefruit, plus melon, cotton candy, a bit of dank, a slight earthiness. Smooth middle. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Low booziness. F - medium body with lower than average. O - a tad sweet but highly enjoyable otherwise."
871,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.44,"2017 Bomber. Thanks Adam and Jay! Had a great time and a great trade.  Inky black from the bottle and into the Carpe Brew Em snifter. A thick brown ring forms and then recedes to about 1/2 finger, then to nothing. Slight legs streaking down the glass.  Aromas of rich dark chocolate, tobacco, quite a bit of soy sauce though it's not off-putting, molasses, fig, and a bit of dark fruit as well.  That soy sauce comes through on the flavor, with a little wet paper, could be the age, but beyond that I get tons of dried dark fruit, dried apricot, and then tobacco, molasses, black olives, caramel sauce, and dark chocolate.  Feel is heavy, thick, mean, but never oversaturated with alcohol; just the right amount of heat falling down onto the tongue and warming the throat.  Overall an incredible beer. I can't wait to try the BA variant."
872,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.57,"One of my ""hope"" list for TH. Never thought I'd be at TH when they had this, especially during Covid. BUT, I was and scored a couple of these. WELL worth it for sure. FLASH! Just had my second one and it’s even better! 7/9/21"
873,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.46,"Enjoyed out of a brown 750 mL bottle with a sticker denoting it as being bottled on 9/13/2016. Consumed as part of a small bottle share on 4/22. Poured into a teku style glass. Appearance (4.25) - Pours a vibrant yellow with just the slightest twinge of orange giving it a depth of color. Not really terribly hazy, but it's also not completely translucent either--likely from the fact that we had no lambic basket handy to keep the yeast confined to the bottom of the bottle. The dregs looked like straight juice. Not much of a head--just a little bit and pretty much no lacing to speak of. Smell (4.5) - Wonderful aroma of fresh-cut, ripe peach flesh is accentuated by underlying acidity and brightness from the wild bacteria. Honestly, there's not much to write about the aroma because it's so simple and straightforward. The peach flavor is front and center, even though it's been seven months since bottling. Taste (4.5) - The flavor very much follows from the smell here, with the juicy flavor of fresh peach leading the way. Providing support is a nice lemony, citric tartness that is enough to counterbalance the sweetness of the stone fruit. Hiding in the background is a bit more complexity, with shades of funkiness and a woody mustiness. Mouthfeel (4.25) - Light bodied and moderate to light carbonation. Finish has just enough pucker to give your cheeks that little pinch of sour. Overall (4.5), a fantastic beer and one of the most true to the flavor of peach that I can recall having tried. I suppose I shouldn't be that surprised when two of the heavyweights of brewing sour beers with fruit put their heads together on a recipe. Would be really curious to try the Side Project version."
874,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,5.0,"B2 April 4, 2017 pours out a mostly clear brilliant golden straw color, creamy bright white head with suds atop and great retention. aromas of lemon, hay, fresh cut grass, floral, oak, mellow earthy funk, spice and bright citrus peel in there. on palate there is the above mentioned notes with even more depth and coherence. quite a pungent hit of fruity citrus and fuzzy peach flavor dancing in there, almost invoking characteristics of a NEIPA. but there is this beautiful funky dryness and oak character to balance it out. hay, fresh cut grass, lemon peel, musty grape skin, white grape, mellow acidity, oaky sweetness hinting at vanilla. the feel is so effervescent and crisp, wonderfully complimenting the flavor profile."
875,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.5,"Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a Bourbon County tulip, with a dark black color and small khaki head. Smell was dominated by coconut. Taste was Dark fruit, milk chocolate, vanilla, loads of coconut, and a bit of tannic dryness. Coconut forward, but balanced. ABV is well hidden."
876,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.99,L: standard TIPA color nothing special looking but very good looking
877,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.45,"Poured a light peach hazy color. No translucence. Aroma pretty heavy with citrus creamsicle. It’s all that I can pick up, but wow, delightful. Upon tasting, it’s just as the same; orange creamsicle, touch of peach, and vanilla. Not complex but a very easy drinking fruit desert! Mouthfeel very creamy and smooth. A little hop bite at the end. Overall, this is excellent, mostly juicy sweet citrus with a little vanilla."
878,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.19,"Pours jet black with a ittle bit of chocolate colored foam. Smell is rich and sweet, with notes of walnuts, chocolate, coffee, golden syrup and vanilla. Taste takes all the elements from the nose and adds oak, booze and slightly hot chilis. Mouthfeel is full, well carbonated. Overall, a very good stout, with just a little bit too much heat from the chillis for me."
879,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.93,Picture yourself in a boat on a river 
880,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.74,"Yet another amazing Tree House NEIPA. Medium hued orange juice, light foam and lacing. Dank and citrusy hop notes on the nose. Taste is a bit sharp, a bit tangy. Cirtusy, juicy, dank, slight bitterness on the back end. Well balanced. Medium bodied, boozier than a 6.8 should be, slightly dry finish. Just damn yummy."
881,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.5,"Pours a perfect hazy copper with minimal head. Aroma of sweet brown sugar, molasses, dark fruits. Flavor follows nose: light brown sugar, light molasses, ripe figs, nice barrel flavor. Pretty full bodied, abv is well masked. Overall a fantastic BA barleywine."
882,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.34,"Pours a hazy orange color with a thick white colored head with tons of lacing down the glass. The head stays as a small layer over the beer for most of the way down. Smells like a treehouse, it's extremely aromatic with hints of orange, grapefruit, and even a bit of sugar at the end of it. Tastes of juicy grapefruit mostly with a hint of a sweet melon about halfway through. Finishes tart, not exactly as smooth as I was hoping for coming from the famed Julius line but overall pretty good. Thick mouthfeel with a bit of warming from the high abv."
883,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.25,"330 ML bottle, born on 3/4/2020, poured into a taster at 48 degrees F (tasting of the Trappistes Rochefort 6/8/10 with my sister and brother-in-law):"
884,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.67,Blend #50 purchased from monks cafe on 10/1/2020  L - pours a golden straw with a white head that dissipates completely 
885,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.69,"Shared this with a friend on my back porch as evening descended on Little Rhody. Pours pitch black with a beautiful head of tight-bubbled foam which dissipates after a few sips... aroma is quite pronounced, little creamy and a lot of roastiness. Nice so far! Taste is very roasty with some notes of dark fruits and slight sweetness that never overpowers. Mouthfeel could not be more perfect - this is carbed just right and despite the 12% ABV it does not coat the mouth and never becomes cloying or sticky sweet.  Overall a very enjoyable heavy-hitting stout, so glad I got to try this!"
886,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.56,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into an angry chair pint glass.  Pours a deep brown, nearly black opaque body with a dark brown smallish head that sticks around for a minute or so before reduces to a ring of retention. Spotty lacing.  Aromas are the epitome of a pastry stout - straight chocolate cake with vanilla frosting, cocoa, Hershey's syrup, rich chocolate truffles.  On the tongue it's pretty sweet with tons of vanilla and chocolate, cocoa, roasty chocolate malt, coffee cake, fudgy brownies topped with caramel drizzle. Rich, decadent mouthfeel, medium-low carbonation with a heavy body.  Quite a delightful beer, this is the definition of a pastry stout. It's liquid cake. I've had the barrel aged version and while the barrel adds an extra dimension, and makes this beer that much better, this is quite a treat."
887,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.25,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 375mL bottle* This beer poured out a pastel orange color onto my glass, also hazy in appearance from the yeast. It had about a finger thick white colored head on my initial pour, but it disappeared almost immediately leaving a bit of a lacing around my glass. The aroma on this was both funky and peachy upfront, being true to its name ""Peche n' Brett"". While I mostly got stone fruit aromas ranging from notes of peaches to apricots, I was also able to perceive notes of caramel and vanilla in the back-end with the funk and oakiness still present. Upfront on the taste, I was able to get a nice presence of sweet peaches with a slight nectarine sourness as well. The sour nectarine notes lingered to the middle and finish and was accompanied by notes of under-ripe mandarin oranges. Overall, I would say that the sour nectarine-like taste was the most prominent flavor that I got. This was medium bodied and had a moderate amount of carbonation to it. As for its drink-ability, I thought that this was super easy to drink despite having a 10% ABV. Almost no alcohol was perceived. I thought that this beer, overall, was pretty decent but not my personal favorite. It was very good and highly drinkable, but it seemed a little boring for me to drink. I wish it was a bit more fruity than sour, but it isn't bad at all how it was when I drank it."
888,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,5.0,2020-12-06 Crowler poured yesterday at Sam the Beer Man. 
889,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.0,"BBA imperial (13.7% abv) stout featuring vanilla and coconut... Nothing wrong here, but its an unexceptional take on the style - that said, yes - you get bourbon, you get vanilla, and you get coconut, too - high-abv stout body with appropriate chocolatiness and coffee - maybe I'm just jaded - this 12 oz. bottle was $9.99 IIRC - Prairie being notoriously high-priced (right? lol) - so in sum, you get what they advertise, but to my tastes it doesn't do anything with the ingredients that elevates it above peer drinks, or to justify the price... Fans of vanilla and coconut BBA stouts will absolutely dig this though..."
890,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.39,"Tasted at Copenhagen Festival A: Pours a deep burnt golden color, almost amber. Had a finger of sticky, greasy, off-white head that held great retention. The head eventually faded into a thick collar leaving sheets of sticky lace down the glass. "
891,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.73,Canned 9 days ago. Poured into pint glass.
892,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,5.0,Best of the OG IPAs…. Had it in Waitsfield. had it from a can in a Jersey grocery store. Had it on a golf course…. Where ever you find it…. This stuff is the best
893,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.27,"Dark dark brown, fairly opaque. Thin mocha head settles into a ring around my glass with a central floating island. Aroma is black coffee, sweet vanilla bean, boozy bourbon barrel. Bitter dark coffee, sweet vanilla bourbon barrel, roasted dark malt. Bittersweet baking cocoa. A bit lighter body than I expected, boozy heat, lighter carbonation suitable to the style. Big brew, booze stuck around. Rich barrel and coffee."
894,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,5.0,"10oz. tap sampled from a snifter at Ansari's - Eagan, MN. So, I love vanilla and for me this beer is absolutely delicious. Strong vanilla in the aroma and flavor. Thick and creamy. If someone told me I had to pick just one beer to drink for the rest of my life, this would be in the running."
895,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.53,100 score on BA - World Class. I'd think that would be recommended.
896,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,3.9,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Pitch black colour, moderate tan head. Aroma of roast malts, coffee, exotic woodwork and dark chocolate. Sweet flavour with distinct notes of coffee, vanilla and dark chocolate."
897,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.56,My favorite of the Lou Pepe series. Beautiful color and a tremendous sour cherry flavor. Not quite as rich as the Hanssen's
898,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.74,Straight from Tree House. Canned 4 days ago. 16oz can into pint glass.
899,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.94,"Everything I love about barrel aged stouts. Thick, oily, coats the glass. Smells sweet, but not overly so. The taste follows with sweetness, barrel oak/vanilla flavors. Not overly sweet, with enough heat to balance it perfectly. (2017 Handjee)"
900,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.41,"I have not drunk many beers over the last few weeks life has been topsy turvy. I am so ready to get off this roller coaster. Fuzzy duck, like the name of this beer, the can art is awesome. The beer is 45 degrees and served in a pint glass. The head retention is excellent. The beer's head produced a two finger thick frothy, creamy and airy. The head left lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 6 a deep gold color with amber hues. The clarity of the beer is hazy. Overall the beer has a beautiful appearance.  The aromas in the beer are bright citrus ( oranges, mandarins, lemons, and grapefruit), toasted malts, biscuits, honey-like sweetness, a touch of herbal, a touch of floral, and a hint of grass.  The flavors in the beer are bright oranges, mandarins, lemons, grapefruit, toasted malts, biscuits, honey-like sweetness, a touch of herbal, grass, bready, and a hint of pine.  The mouthfeel of the beer is astringent and fizzy.  The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and a full finish.  A bright flavorful beer. The NEIPA beer is on point and so glad I got to drink it. I wish I had a few more of these to drink."
901,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.44,So excited to find this brew at Canal’s in Berlin NJ. Top notch super hazy murky deep golden look with an offwhite head with some staying power. Wonderful fruity and sweet Citra nose on this puppy. Ooh that’s tasty. Very fruit driven and sweet with a drying gentle grapefruit and pine bitterness. I’d call this just south of creamy with good carbonation for the style. This is well balanced but I think I like the DDH Double Mosaic Dream better although this is a fine brew. Love the feel along with the flavor of this one.
902,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.57,"750ml consumed at Side Project. Smell and Taste are: Milk chocolate, sour cherry, lactic, acidic, lemon peel, sweet caramel Overall very lucky to try this one"
903,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.75,"This was one of the two or three beers in the TH box I was most looking forward to, and I saved it for last out of 12. Can’t tell if it was canned 2/10, 13, 16, or 18. Hazy orange juice appearance with mild head and lacing. Strong dank and tangy citrus aromas. Taste is a dank pine, slightly bitter, with a citrusy juiciness wrapped around it all-tropical, lush, flavorful. Light to medium bodied, a clean dry finish. I like how it’s not heavy on the tongue. A juice bomb, but a subtle juice bomb, if such a thing exists. Well worth the wait, and delivered on the hype."
904,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.28,"Poured from 16oz tall can into a tulip. Canned 6/17/20. Appearance: highly turbid medium-yellow hue, with nearly 3 fingers of frothy, pillowy ivory foam atop. I think it looks quite lovely. Smell: brightly herbal hop aroma, even a bit spicy; there's also a character of citrus zest. It's not juicy to me, per se, but interesting and downright intriguing. Taste: earthy and quite juicy, actually, but I'm having a hard time putting my finger on the juice of *what*. The juice of ... hops, I guess? Extremely smooth with a little bite of bitterness at the end; this is a damn interesting beer. I like it. Mouthfeel: medium-rich body with a big, well-integrated carbonation and really a superb creaminess, especially for the style. Outstanding. Overall: this beer is a bit of a more bitter take on the NEIPA; although it's very smooth, it is a bit prickly. I really like it: the hop flavors are earthy and interesting; although, to be honest, I prefer a more fruity-juicy character in my NEIPAs."
905,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.2,"2018 vintage (Jan 2019 release). A: Pours a viscous black with a finger of dark brown, dense, foamy head. Excellent retention and some lines of lacing.  S: Dark cocoa and raspberry, cinnamon, bourbon, and oak, mild roastiness and a hint of anise. Very appealing and well balanced.  T: Raspberry is a bit more prominent, with cocoa powder, sweet dark molasses, and hefty roastiness. Finishes with moderate puckering tannic sensation. The roast, tannins, and sweetness are a little too prominent and throw it out of balance.  M: Full bodied, thick, with mild carbonation. Very mild alcohol warmth.  O: Smells great but the taste is not as well balanced and so drinkability suffers."
906,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,5.0,"Bourbon is soft, well balanced and tones down the cinnamon, chocolate and other notes. Silky smooth mouth feel; easy on the palate. Worth the bottle...Prost!!"
907,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,3.99,"Batch 6, 9/11/13 Far from a gueuze. Pretty acetic nose, mostly just vinegar, lemon, and some barrel in the nose. Taste is better though still acetic, nice bright citrus fruit, mostly lemon. Low carb, medium body. This is very disappointing. I feel it did not age well, but it should have."
908,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.64,Poured from a can dated 3/4/21
909,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.59,"Wow, I echo what everyone else has said about the beer. For me, its the taste of a very ripe purple mirabelle plum but brandy-like, with that farmhouse sour Belgian ale bouche at the same time. The bourbon barrel must impart the brady quality to beer. The smell reminds me of a tart mirabelle, not a ripe one and prepares you for the sourness. Dark blood ""Sang Noir"" sums up the color. This is not a beginner's beer. I am smoking a Montecristo No. 2 and the combination is sublime. Not sure if its the cigar or there is a hint of aged tobacco leaf in the beer flavor profile? I have some venison backstraps to cook and I think I am going to serve this with it! I'll update."
910,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.66,"The felt and flavor of this beer it’s a perfectly balanced stout that could compare to the OG vanilla type form goose island. Flavors varies by years but overall a great stout. To end up, the alcohol level past inadvertent."
911,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.35,Light golden colored and exceptionally hazy. There’s a half inch of creamy dishwater white on top. The aroma is of mandarin orange. I’m tasting sharply bitter mandarin orange that leaves a long deep burn to the tongue and lingers long after you swallow it.
912,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.03,"Recent vintage although I forgot to tlook for a date. Poured into tulip glass.  Pour: deep black with some brown hints. Well used motor oil. Surprisingly, absolutely no head no matter how I tried. Really thin collar but no lacing at all. Maybe a bad bottle? Aroma: dark dried fruits, some mellow bourbon, Oak, chocolate. Really nice. Balanced with nothing dominating but all working well together.  Taste: surpringly sweet upfront, almost sugary. Definite hops bitterness on backend with chocolate and bourbon in the middle. Bitterness lingers a bit more than I would like. Aftertaste reminds me of pot a little (which I haven’t had in 30 years!). but, still a very good beer.  Feel: very little carbonation. As with the lack of head, maybe a bottle issue? But nice viscosity and very smooth. Not a milkshake but closer to that than water.  Overall: it’s really good beer that probably ages well. Have one in the cellar to try in a Year or two. Really like it but the lingering bitterness is a slight turn off relative to BBA stouts like CBS and Bourbon County. But that’s a high standard!"
913,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.84,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a yellow/orange prairie Dino glass. Pours a deep brown body with a light brown head that reduces quickly to leave a ring. Aromas of strong coconut and vanilla, run and milk chocolate.. this is straight chocolate covered coconuts.  On the tongue.. absolutely decadent chocolate coconut macaroons and sweet vanilla rum. Thick rich body, velvety.  One of the best stouts I've ever tasted.. this is a real vanilla coconut stout, kills prop 13"
914,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.29,"Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of brown covering nearly all of the top. Light lacing. The aroma is of coffee, maple syrup, and bacon fat. I’m tasting maple syrup, dark chocolate, coffee, and smoky bacon fat. The dark chocolate and coffee really linger after the swallow. The mouth is oily, viscous, and lightly sticky and chewy."
915,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.44,"Tasted from bottle. Classic farmhouse saison. Pours a hazy gold. Fruity and funky aroma. Crisp, light, refreshing mouthfeel. Flavors of citrus fruit, farmhouse funk and some grassy earthy flavors. Excellent."
916,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.66,Very dark brown body with a small head
917,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.12,"Shared bottle at local tasting. Cloudy golden colour, white head. Intense and lovely aroma of brettanomyces / farmhouse and apricots. Sour flavour, notes of lemons, apricot and brettanomyces."
918,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.66,"8oz pour on draft at the brewery tasting room. looks dark maroon to dark brown with tan swirls. smells of sharp acidity, bourbon soaked cherries with a little drizzle of chocolate. taste is very light bourbon, rich acidity, sour cherries and chocolate maltiness. feel is full and somewhat more carbonated than expected but nothing to complain about. overall, the intense sourness is balanced quite well by the maltiness and chocolate flavors. such a unique beer. very glad to have finally tried this."
919,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.5,"2012 vintage (BR/3""); drank 3/5/16 @ the Yarchives.  Brown/black appearance.  Small tan head; minimal lace.  Milk chocolate, bourbon & oak notes in the nose.  Medium thick, sticky mouthfeel.  Black coffee, oak & milk chocolate flavors up front; mild raspberry notes on the finish. Booze heat emerged as this warmed.  A complex, rich treat that was easy to quaff. Well done!"
920,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.96,"One of my favorite stouts ever. Such a strong coconut and vanilla taste that really had me wanting more . Such a thicc boi as well, highly recommend trading or searching out for this beer."
921,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.56,"375ml corked and caged bottle - date missing - poured into a tulip...thing at 45°F. Pours a beautiful brilliant clear light straw golden hue, no head, no collar, with slow rising effervescence. Has the appearance of chardonnay in the glass. Nose: Unbelievably bright and sprightly, with sparkling notes of lemon, lime, pomello, spring meadow blossoms, green apple, petrichor, wet grass, top soil, unripe white grape, damp forest, river rocks, wet hay, old wood, old parchment, desert sage, old attic, musty farmhouse, old oak, woody vanillin, mature white wine, stone cellar, and this beautiful floral, almost perfumey wild brightness. Some bretty funk really shines through, and this is channelling a lot of Cantillon spirit. Palate: Beatification greets the palate with a huge flash of bright, sour lemon. It brings a pucker, but not an acetic vinegar bite - sour lemon juice atop a massive brett funk. Lemons, lime, citron, unripe white grape, fresh grass, spring flowers, underripe apricot and nectarine, plum, green apple, and a hint of beeswax, before this firm, punchy bitterness bites down hard. With this, the acidity is obliterated, and the truly funky notes start to emerge - wild mushroom, bitter peach pit, bitter grapefruit peel, sweat, cracked white peppercorn, sea shells, dried leaves, oversteeped flower tea, cork tree, and finally, tons of splintery, tannic, musty white oak. This almost pithy, resinous bitterness just lingers on and on, slowly receding as the oak becomes more prominent. Some pale, slightly toasted grain emerges, and by now, there isn't a trace of sourness. The finish sees an eventual drop in bitterness, with the oak taking the spotlight, finishing tannic, drying, and clean, with a whisper of white pepper lingering. Mouthfeel/Body: For a 6% ABV spontaneously fermented ale, the body has some presence, never feeling thin or lacking, but remaining snappy and fluid. The bitterness surely adds weight. A quick pucker up front that fades in a short moment, with tannic bitterness taking the lead. Effervescence is lively and zippy, but not aggressive, and with very fine bubbles. Dry. Very drying. Overall: This one is unique. This reminds me a whole lot of Cantillon Iris. It doesn't have the same immense depth, and it's quite a bit more bitter, but blind, I'd believe this was a bitter oude gueuze if you told me. The bitterness is very unique, and it adds a whole other layer. The fast evolution of flavours and senses is quite remarkable. It's so delicate, bright, and nuanced - much like Florence, but then that bold shift comes out of nowhere. It clearly has some very mature ale blended in, as there's a ton of oak, and it's just a wonderful expression that captures the beauty of spontaneous fermentation."
922,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.81,The best of the Hill Farmstead IPAs in My opinion. Smooth and bitter and the same time and a very delicate balance. Nose of citrus and color is like fruit juice.
923,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.71,"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Tree House Willi Becher glass; canned 11/20/20, code WHERE WILL YOU FIND YOURS/"
924,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.42,"Blend #3.  A: Pours a fizzy, light pale orange color with basically no head.  S: Fresh apricot, moderate and well-integrated barnyard, and a bit of pepper and vanilla. T: Apricot and earthy barnyard complement each other nicely. Light malty sweetness, lemon, and medium-light lactic sourness on a longish finish.  M: Medium-light body and medium-high, prickly carbonation.  O: Lots of fresh apricot flavor with well-integrated funkiness."
925,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.41,"Maybe i was to hyped for this one. It was a 2018 so maybe it was not a good year compared to others. smell was great, taste was average. Body was thin. Have one more that i now plan on trading"
926,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.55,"The color, deep rich magenta, and the nose, total passion fruit bomb, were absolutely amazing! Taste was basically passion fruit juice without any detectable ""beer-ness"" other than carbonation, which left me somewhat undecided as part of me thinks a beer should taste a little like beer. That said, the usually enamel ripping sourness of de Garde Bu way down and you get JWB berliner, which to me sets THE high bar for all others."
927,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.41,"What an outstanding brew! Look: Nice haze, typical with this style Smell: I get citrus, slight melon rind and pineapple  Feel: Smooth with light carbonation  Taste: Juicy and dank, golden promise is the standout, becoming one of my favorites  Overall: An excellent brew all around. Lives up to the hype. An instant classic!"
928,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.19,"L- Jet black....mocha head...... moderate lacing S-Aroma is faint......notes of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, slight coffee and a small whiff of the pepper T-Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, chili's..... F-Medium bodied.....some slight prickliness from the carb.....some heat from the booze and chili's O- Solid, enjoyable but was hoping for more given the price"
929,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.73,"I was surprised when saw king Sue on tap in a local bar. Ordered a pint , it was served in a frosted pint glass. As you know this is a renouned beer rated 100 on BA and # 49 in the top rated beer list. Have to say it lives up to it’s hype. This beer is an orange gold color with a thick white lasting head. Very complex aroma of citrus, pine, and herbs. The taste is also complex but is so well blended that nothing stands out. Full mouthfeel and a finish that matches the aroma. King Sue is just about the best Hazy IPA I have ever tasted. I asked for an unfrosted glass for my 2OND pint."
930,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.4,"2018 vintage opened cellar temp on 4/2/2020 Pours dark as night with a wispy mocha head.nose is sweet maple, bourbon , vanilla, either some ethenol or hot peppers. Taste follows the nose - starts very sweet with maple, bourbon, and vanilla, this leads to some pepper and a taste of bakers chocolate, the finish is a nice heat from the peppers and a lingering sweetness. Flavors are fantastic but to nitpick they could be slightly better blended but best flavor I have had in a BA cake. Feel is thin for the style, but with the intense nose and taste, the lighter body of the beer works well. Minimal carb. Overall, this is the best variant I have had to date and for a two year old beer, the flavors are holding up excellent."
931,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.76,"This one pours a darkish orange, with a small head and a good bit of lacing. This smells like super lemony acidity, mineral mustiness, lemongrass, dry hay, stone fruit, and lots of earthy funk. The taste is similar and incredibly complex. There's a ton of incredibly sour lemon acidity, with a deep and complex funk that feels like lemongrass, hay, chalky minerals, wet oak, and light wine. This is blended incredibly well, with a full mouthfeel, a high drinkability, and a long lingering sourness on the finish This is essentially a pinnacle of American sour brewing. It's exemplary."
932,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.49,"2020 vintage. Beer pours black with brown foam. Smells like chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The taste stays around quite long, quite some roast and coffee present. The body is just a little thin, but overall a very nice beer."
933,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.76,"75 cl. corked bottle from Las Buenas Pulgas. Served at home in a tulip glass. Pours a kind of red colored-fuchsia, small head that vinishes almost before you fill the glass, no lacing."
934,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.45,"Bottle on-site at de Garde. The aroma and flavor of this beer are incredible, but it had very low carbonation. Not sure if it was just the bottle I had or if that is typical. Either way, it is a great fruited wild ale."
935,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.56,"Canned on 9-9-19, consumed on 9-21-19. Best buy date 10-21-19. Pours a creamy, murky, dank looking pale orange color. 1 finger white, frothy head. The head retention is good, and there's a nice ring of lacing on the glass as the head dissipates. "
936,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.62,"Abyss black body; fizzy carbonation percolating up through the depths; initial decent head yet it quickly dissipates to a thin fizzy ring dancing around the circumference of the glass. Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality. 2020 edition, unknown ABV (the 2021 version is 11.8% ABV). This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department. This is one awesome imperial stout augmented with a devilish chili pepper kick."
937,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.85,An amazingly brewed raspberry red lambic with smells of musty raspberries and cherries and brett. Tastes of raspberry sweetness hit the palate first followed by sour cherries and brett with subtle oakiness. This particular beer was aged Mar. 22 2018 and drinking it exactly 1 year later on Mar. 22 2019. Very very good but not giving a 5 only because I find Cantillon to be slightly better.

939,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.58,This beer was solid. Not sure its world class but def i great beer. something about the color made me give it a 5 not sure if its the honey or what
940,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.21,"Pours a deep dark brown with beige edges and a half finger of fluffy tan head. The nose is reminiscent of coffee with cream. The flavor follows the nose with more than a touch of sweetness on the finish. The mouthfeel is sticky. This offering is tasty and the coffee qualities are lights out. However, the stout qualities are a bit lacking."
941,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.75,"Bottled 6/7/16; drank 5/29/17 @ the Yarchives.  Cloudy red/purple appearance; champagne bubbles throughout.  A rough pour yielded a nice, noisy khaki head; almost no lace.  Tart strawberry, strawberry jam & sea salt notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Strawberry jam & cabernet sauvignon flavors up front; tart strawberry & mild oak notes in the nose.  A balanced fruit treat; I'd love to have a case in my cellar. Delicious."
942,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.63,"Pours a jet black with a large light brown head that goes away quickly. Smell is of chocolate and maple notes. Taste is the same with an alcoholic coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is in my opinion surprisingly medium. Overall, a good one from founders."
943,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.59,"Bottle shared by Justin. Thanks man! Thick black body with a small khaki collar. Huge aroma of cinnamon, cocoa powder, spirits. The flavor is incredibly complex, with each component integrated beautifully into the overall flavor profile. Smooth and silky on the palate. Lingering sweetness and booze complexity. Wonderful."
944,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.17,"Crowler split with a friend. Picked up at Sabatinis in Exeter Pa a week ago  Looks decent enough in a large wine glass. Jet black body, small tan head doesn't last too long, hence not much lacing. Faintly boozy aroma, almost RIS-like. A little molasses, faint smoke. On tasting, the roast is pretty strong on this one. There are some dark fruit notes, and some warmth from the barrel. Light bourbon notes. Does feel smooth rolling around the tongue. Some molasses, and even faint soy. Mouth between medium and full, finish a warm boozy roast. Overall, not as good as I hoped, roast a bit much for this palate."
945,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.96,"I don't normally start by stating the overall impression of the beer, but Damon is quite possibly my platonic ideal of a barrel-aged stout."
946,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.65,"05/2016 - 2014 vintage - No effs given about the price for on-site consumption as this beer is truly complex, multi-layered, and beautiful. Semi-sweet, oak, funky, nice tartness; balanced."

948,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,3.65,My 2021 Hop Slam was pretty fresh. This was a different beer than prior years...upfront malty taste but lacking flavor....finished with bitterness not previously experienced. I was disappointed in this year's batch.

950,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.45,Bottled 3-28-18 L-The beer pours glossy and black allowing no light penetration even at the edges. The head is a modest 3/4 finger high and mocha in color. The head recedes to a thin film with thicker central island. Lacing is minimal but can be raised by swirling.
951,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.5,"Pours a bright, opaque orange with a finger and a half of white foam for head. Head retention is good, as is the lacing left behind. Aroma is orange, papaya, mango, melon, and pineapple layered over biting pale and wheat malt notes. Lovely citrusy aroma luring in the lips for a sip. Flavor profile is smooth and round notes of orange, pineapple, melon, and mango. Tropical fruits are suspended over a base of wheat, pale, and biscuity malt notes. Hops absolutely dominate the flavor profile ratio here. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy, velvety texture that drives this beers presence from modest to unabashed. Overall, it's pack-a-punch without remorse. It carries a heavy weight, and manages to deliver it unbroken. Big citrus notes, both domestic and tropical, layered over thin, but firm, malts.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can."
952,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.17,"16oz can date 4/28/21 L: thick fluffy white head well lasting strong lacing, haze, yellow deep orange  S: mango and tropical fruits, bubble gum  T: right over the line of tropical fruit vs that over ripe note. Light bitterness M smooth creamy  O does not drink like 8 abv and feel Julius as more straight orange with out the over ripe notes"

954,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.49,"Poured from a can (2/24) into a Teku L: brown orange color, more dirty than creamy. Great white head with solid lacing. As I drink it lacing really is standout S: soft, tropical, dank fruit I'd expect from galaxy. Passionfruit, mango, orange, grapefruit. Maybe some slight piney notes. Even, beautiful nose that's getting me excited for a sip! T: nose follows through but a bit more subdued, led by sharper citrus notes (orange/grapefruit) with a decent hop bite. Some piney flavor, steers clear of the vegetal/grassy issues I've had with some galaxy (that may be more galaxy batch than beer, but still). Nice hint of abv warmth as I drink it, but there's no boozy notes of note (sorry...) F: quite soft without being creamy or overly pillowy. Medium carbonation. Hard to not just down this frankly O: a really fantastic beer, showcases what I love about galaxy in a NEIPA without becoming an overly sweet bomb. Have had this a couple times before (can and draft), today's post-work quarantine experience probably my favorite"
955,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.92,Tasted this in a flight at the brewery on Jan 7th 2021first time ever tasting Assassin drove 4 hours because this was on tap. I had half a pour in the afternoon at 5 last of it as the keg blew.
956,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.52,"Had at Cantillon brewery, from bottle.  L: Bright berry red color. Very little thin head. Slightly opaque. S: Huge raspberry nose, touch of other citrus, and small sour. T: Sweet, raspberry, sour, tart, Brett. F: Light, refreshing. O: Fantastic beer. Really well balanced raspberry, tart and bealgian yeast taste."
957,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.3,"Hazy orange color with off-white head. Aroma has tart fruits, fermented notes, herbs and a bit of fruit vinegar. Taste is balanced, fruity, mineral with bitter fruit pits and almonds. Medium body with low carbonation. Quite nice wild ale with lots of farmhouse funk and fruit flavors."
958,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.8,"2016 Silver Wax. Aroma has whiskey, maple, toffee and umami. Taste has wood barrel, umami, dark fruit, maple and toffee. Bitter cacao and coffee aftertaste."

960,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.59,"bottled Sept 27 2018; today is 6/22/21 pours a slightly hazy peach-gold body with a billowing, fluffy burnt cream colored head that has moderate retention and leaves no lacing behind as it settles to a murky cap with defined halo aroma is funky apricot/bright stone fruit and...olive? yep. little bit in there. there's a complimentary spiciness on the wings, along with a vinegar-like tinge  taste an expansion of these aroma notes; the vinegar, olive, and bright stone fruit (along with green apple) come together with a flash of sudden extreme unity before dispersing and layering with the sweet brightness of the fruit hitting first, the robust olive splitting up the party, and the vinegar symbolically bringing it all back home.  mouthfeel is high carbonation and mid-level body, running slightly crisp yet full and nearly mellow before finishing with a lightly sweet vinegar tinged dryness.  overall:"
961,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.85,"This is one of those beers I wish I had more of, waiting in line at 3 AM and only getting one was rough, but worth it. No trading this one for me. The flavors were all there from a typical Neapolitan (chocolate, vanilla and strawberry). The strawberry being the most dominant coming through giving it a super sweet flavor. Excellent combo if you ask me, would love to see this collaboration happen again. Cycle and 3 sons are putting out phenomenal beers."
962,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.56,"Tried in the taproom a few months back. Really strong hip and citrus flavors, but nicely balanced and a great finish. Probably the best IPA I’ve ever had, up there with some Seattle IPAs."
963,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.54,"A bit murky and dark colored; excellent head production and good retention. Super bright and hoppy nose; absolutely delivers, with citrus, bright herbs, pine, and some tropical fruit. Similar on the palate, delivering far more juice than a beer at this ABV has any right to claim. Waves of juicy and bright hops, all with a pleasant malt sweetness. Orange, mango, lemon, oregano, mint, and pineapple. Very nicely balanced bitterness. Smooth and creamy, huge body for the ABV. I expect nothing less from Tree House, who have mastered the delivery of this style."
964,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,3.77,"1/2 finger of head on a fairly aggressive pour. Pitch black, but effervescent bubbles give it a thin appearance. Aroma/Taste of rich roasted malt, bourbon and light maple syrup. Mouthfeel a bit thin but that is balanced by the good amount of carbonation."
965,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.54,"Thanks Adam! 16oz canned 6/17 poured into a tulip - my second Tree House brew ever. A: Murky warm gold pour, reminiscent of the Jjjulius I tried first. Better head lacing left behind on the glass on this one. S: Divinely hoppy; tropical, mango, papaya, citrus, hop candy, light impressions of resin. T: Yes, please - tropical fruit purée, mango and papaya, peach and blood orange, light astringency, hard hop candy again, fruity sweetness.  MF: So creamy and drinkable and smooth for 8%, these are sneaky easy to down. O: A great brew, not quite as nice as Jjjulius for my palate, this reminds me a lot of a really good Revision or Fort George hazy, which is props to those guys and also to Tree House; imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."
966,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.67,"(Reposted review from Duplicate Entry; Original Review based on draft. Scores for the bottle are virtually the same, although I might edge up the taste to a 4.75 as the bottle seemed to be even more integrated than the draft). C'mon. What did you expect when two southern lords from House Barreltheon formed an alliance in St. Stoutsberg with a legion of adjuncts at their disposal? Not even the band of soulless mule-riding shitlords could take away the enjoyment of this Neapolitan treat. A: Black like John Snow's cold dead eyes. A half inch head of Dothraki shaded foam quickly decapitates itself into a thin ring.  "
967,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.27,"FRom the bottle, it pours a stygian brown/block color, blocking all light transmission, with a modest light brown head that remains and leaves lacing as you enjoy it. The nose is lovingly smothered with scents of maple, chocolate, caramel, almonds and fudge ice cream. In the mouth, it smoothly runs over the tongue leaving behind tastes of bitter chocolate, fudge and a touch of maple syrup. Wow!"
968,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.57,"total AMARETTO on the nose and palate in tiny sips.... the feel, the smell and the taste in super small sips is completely Amaretto.... slightly thinner than i expected."

970,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,5.0,Tasted it up against King Julius and Jjjuliusss. Liked King Julius just a hair better but all incredible. Huge citrus and I get some tropical fruits. Orange and grapefruit up front with a finish of pineapple and some papaya. Definitely crushable. Wow.
971,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.73,"An interesting color suggesting a blend of cranberry juice and strawberry purée; lively carbonation yet very little in the way of lasting head. Lovely aroma filled with cherry sweetness and a touch of tartness with a smidgen of brett. A strong burst of cherry and raspberry flavor right off; an amazing blend of tartness and sweetness perfectly balanced; an incredible sweet and sour taste. Heavy body yet airy; tart and acidic balanced with cherry sweetness. If you want something different, this is a beer to try! It is very much a fruit-forward lambic, highlighting sour cherries but also using raspberries (per the bottle label). The blending of this beer is truly artful, the result being a stupendous and lovely beer. Bottling date: 13/09/18, ABV 5.6%"
972,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,5.0,"Picked-up two cans at Tree House Brewery in Charlton for about eleven dollars. My one hundred and forty eighth brew from these guys. I had just gone to TH the week before, but when I saw this drop, I knew what I had to do. Lived up to my imagination, ridiculously good."
973,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.5,"Grapefruit aroma jumps out of the can when you pop the top. Hazy and juicy in the glass with a nice, silky head. New England fruity hop flavor blends with the bite of New Zealand hops. The long sustained taste is absolute heaven."
974,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.78,"Delicious world class pale ale. It really seems to have changed over the years, but it's still a fantastic citra bomb. Great pillowy mouthfeel, not too bitter, and a lot of citrus."
975,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.85,"A black, beautiful beer with a tan head. Dark fruit, bourbon, char and vanilla are the dominant smell. Just the most wonderful stout you could want, big barrel character with the dark fruits and vanilla to round it out. If I could knock it a little, it would be mouthfeel. It could be a touch chewier, but overall this is a delicious beer. Cheers!"
976,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.97,"2007 vintage - First opened July 4, 2021 - Review on July 6, 2021.  This beer looks thick as heck while pouring. It's a red/brown color coming from the bottle. There's no head at all, which doesn't surprise me one bit, based on the age and ABV. "
977,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.94,Look: Straw Yellow Clear with thin white head. Has medium carbonation.
978,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.66,"2021, 12.3% Cinnamon and licorice are two beer ingredients that don't entice me so I passed on this offering last year. Since then I have tried a few BA offerings from Fremont and they have all been stellar. Plus the cinnamon in the B-bomb was amazing, so I took the leap this year.  There is just so much here and no one element dominates. The licorice and cinnamon provide a nice counter punch to keep a sweet, chocolatey stout in check. The smoke and the bourbon barrels bring it all together perfectly. The bourbon notes are so damn good, no harsh wood or sharp alcohol. The body is full and rich. Just an amazing beer. Fremont's barrel program is among the best imo. Everything I've tried so far has had such rich, decadent barrel notes. They are clearly sourcing freshly emptied, top-notch barrels and putting them to good use."
979,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,3.83,"Had at CBC 2016. I love sour beers, and there were some great ones there. This one was simply too much though; everything that would probably make this beer great as well gets overshadowed by the extreme sourness. Without a doubt the most sour beer I've ever had. As a bit of a novelty , definitely worth trying. But man, my teeth hated me after this one."
980,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,5.0,"Bottled Oct 27,2017. $14 bottle. Beautiful dark brown with not much head, just a thin lip of khaki creamy bubbles activated in a thin centimeter around the edge of the glass. Scents bring on predominantly maple, touched with coffee, and bourbon. The taste is primarily sweet, and swims in delicious chocolate, maple, toffee, char, cherries, and as it washes over the palate the bitterness of the coffee arrives. The bourbon is there but not too strong and flavors the beer fortifying it with its alcoholic strength. Complements the coffee. Minutes after sipping my mouth retains the coffee and bourbon - it is an experience that lasts longer than a typical beer. Mouthfeel is medium thick punctuated by the tiniest of bubbles. Overall this is a complex and delicious beer. I have to say I’m a fan of the high abv because I love concentrated alcohol. Im a big fan of Mephistopheles and gave it a 5/5, and put some bottles away for special occasions. I’m going to have to do the same with this because I’m so impressed with the experience. Luckily my local store has a stock of many bottles and I’ll probably buy them up, even though they’re on the expensive side."
981,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.31,"Bought at Hazel's in Boulder, CO on 05/13/21. 4 pack of 16 oz cans for $18.49 before tax. Canned 05/04/21, consumed 06/01/21. A&S: Similar to Heady Topper rating, I kept this one in the can except for a small amount I poured out for a look and a little for aroma. Foamy white head pours a half finger and retains really well. Hazy light yellow, some carbonation bubbles rising up. The aroma is very grassy and floral, with lemon rind. T&M: Upfront lemon-orange citrus. Very floral in the mid-taste which moves gradually to a good bitter bite at the end. More grain forward than other IPA, with good balance. This one I enjoyed more in a glass than Heady Topper, but again I do understand why they suggest drinking from the can. Heavy on the palate, but still heavy carbonation tingle. Overall: I liked this beer, but in my opinion, I don't think this one is even in the same league as Heady Topper."
982,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.19,"5 oz pour on tap. This is a complex beer. Very sour and dry. Leather, cherries, oak, tobacco, deep red wine, vanilla, and bourbon are some of the prominent flavors. Not all that funky. Glad to dry it but wouldn't want to drop $30 on a bottle. 5 oz is enough for me."
983,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.21,"L - A glowing pool of oils, golden hops, and more hops. Almost looks greasy on top. Great lacing, per the ABV."
984,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.66,"One of my favorite BBA Coffee stouts. Avery is able to get really high ABV on these beers. 16% after aging 4 months in Bourbon barrels, WOW! 2017 Bourbon County Coffee is number one, this one is a very close second."
985,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.11,"2018 vintage, 16 oz can, canned in April of the same year. pours an opaque jet black. head is frothy and is a rich cappuccino hue. good retention and lacing. looks the part. aroma is a heck of a lot of coffee but even more chocolate. dark and sweet chocolate aromas all at once. vanilla notes as well. flavor is rich, thick, and fairly cloying. boozy, but not over the top. roasted beans, mild acrid bitterness. "
986,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.25,"650 ml bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV is 12.5%. Pitch black colour, moderate to low tan head. Intense roasty aroma, notes of dark bitter chocolate, tar, tobacco, leather and coffee. Same elements in the flavour, intensely tarry and rich, salty finish."
987,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,3.84,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. A: The beer is a pure black color topped with a wisp of a dark brown head that dissipates quickly, even after a hard pour.  S: An odd initial aroma of soy sauce and earth under pure cocoa. Big boozy bourbon note underneath those layers as well. and the ABV is definitely evident. Not detecting a ton of coconut in there. T: Chocolate and roasted malt mixed with a heavy bourbon taste profile - woody and earthy. Alcohol is definitely evident. Not super balanced. Didn't detect any coconut. Leather. There is some vanilla and sugar sprinkled throughout. Cloying. Overall: This actually didn't really impress me a ton. Not bad, but also not very drinkable. It reminded me a lot of World Wide Stout. It is alright, but really overpowering and not very balanced."
988,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.67,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a thin dark khaki head that dissipates to a few patches with a slender ring around the glass; nearly still. Aroma of dark toasted malt, whiskey, molasses, mild dark stone fruit and caramel. Flavor is rich dark toasted malt, whiskey, caramel, dark chocolate and oaky vanilla. Medium bodied with moderate creaminess; light carbonation, but silky mouth feel. Wow, I'm a bit in shock. This was one a number of nearly ten year old stouts I found in the back of the basement. Most were drinkable, but all were clearly over the stage of improvement from aging. Not this one. I wasn't even going to review it due to its age until I tasted it. Although the near still pour was expected from great age, the aroma and flavor are outstanding. There is little or no oxidation nor other over-age flavors. The malt, chocolate and whiskey are all nicely integrated and fresh tasting. Whiskey is at a perfect level. I now wish I had continued to save this for the ""special occasion"" it was set aside for, this would have been an excellent bottle to share. I see that I paid a lot for this in 2012, but it was well worth it and now I wish I hadn't passed up other more recent versions due to the price point. This is a worthwhile splurge that held up superbly. Extra points for tasting so good at 8 years old."
989,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.49,"Beautiful turbid orange appearance with a little white head. Smell of pine, orange, other citrus - hops. Very warm and spicy for a HF IPA. Taste follows the nose with a smack of pine, citrus, and bitterness. Leaves behind a slight bready taste. Feel is superb for a 10% beer. Slightly chewey and so refreshing. Overall, this is a great IPA that is reminiscent of Pliny, but has the color and some of the nose and taste of a NEIPA"
990,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.8,I can smell the cocoa and coffee but besides that I'm just getting sweet malts. I get a lot of chocolate flavors with an added coffee decadence. It has a medium mouthfeel with just a little carbonation for something akin to velvet. It has a bitter finish that lasts a long time. While I'm not getting the complexities promised of vanilla and chilis this is so so delicious. It's so well balanced and I barely pick up the 12 abv. I give it a 5.8 out of 6. BOOM!
991,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.99,"Canned 2/8. Absolutely amazing. Cloudy orange, fluffy minimal head and lacing. Tropical citrus notes of orange, pineapple, mango, and grapefruit on the aroma that carry over to the taste. However, there’s very little of the dank or bitterness I’ve come to find in their NEIPAs. This one is juice all the way home. Mouth watering, medium bodied, and I’m going to have to try to find a way not to drink it too quickly to see if it fills out as it warms. Just outstanding, and more than lives up to the hype."
992,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.2,"Black with tan head. Mild chocolate on top of malt with toffee, dark dried fruit, and a decent helping of American/citrus/pine/grass hop character. Not too sweet, not too bitter, with a luscious mouthfeel."
993,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.96,"as a 'refined' connosieur these days (hahahahahaaaaaaa..........) i find doling out 5s across the board quite beneath me. but then, what really DOES deserve a 5....? dang, this one really surprised me. thick and creamy and smelling wondrously amazing with the taste folling closely on its footsteps.... i like what the guy below me said: ""it's glass-coating thick""... nose was cinnamon right off, then the taste added some coffee to it and then it all came in to play... i wonder what a higher-abv version of this would bring? could this be the next Theorem next year? "
994,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.38,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 12oz bottle* The look of this beer was a very dark brown, reminiscent of cold brew coffee. This honestly didn't really have a head to it, so I can't really comment on the head, but there was a very thin dark drown lacing around my glass.  The aroma was heavy on the ancho chilies, which was super pungent upfront. It wasn't a one-note smell though, the ancho chillies served as a backbone for an overall savory, slightly sweet, and unique aroma supported by bitter coffee notes and a slight caramel sweetness from the roasted malts. The aroma almost reminded me a little of Korean red pepper paste, but I can also see people thinking this also smells a bit like soy sauce. The taste more or less followed the aroma. The taste of the ancho chillies with a mellow coffee backbone permeated throughout the entire stout from start to finish. Although this beer primarily tasted of ancho chilies, I was also really able to taste most of the different flavorings added to this beer. Upfront, you get the taste of ancho chilies with a mellow coffee herbalness/bitterness that was complimented with a caramel sweetness. The sweet taste of the caramel seemingly disappeared towards the middle and end, which left me with the roasty taste of coffee that was also paired with notes of bitter dark chocolate and of course, ancho chillies. I couldn't necessarily taste the vanilla beans which was added to this, but I felt like it served to mellow and round out the other bolder ingredients which were added. The feel on this was medium to full bodied, had little to no noticeable carbonation, and had a moderate lingering bitterness. All which contributed in making a silky smooth drinking experience. For the ABV, this was stupid drinkable and I felt like I had to keep reminding myself to slow it down and sip. That being said, I couldn't really taste the alcohol in this and there weren't any burning sensations. Overall, I have to say that this was definitely one of the more unique beers that I've ever had. The addition of ancho chillies worked pretty well when combined with coffee, cacao nibs, and vanilla beans, which I felt made this beer a satisfying explosion (no pun intended) of savoriness, sweetness, and roasty bitterness. Definitely good, and definitely worth the price tag."
995,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.55,"A: Pours a pitch black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a decent cap S: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, peanut butter, cocoa, coffee, and some caramel T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of roasted malt, peanut butter, coffee, and cocoa. Picks up some dark chocolate and caramel. Sweet but not overly so. Finishes with lingering peanut butter, roast, and cocoa M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation O: A very good coffee and peanut butter milk stout that fires on all levels. Perfect balance between all of those aspects which makes it super easy to drink, especially at 7.6%. Definitely worth checking out"
996,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.32,"*Aroma: limited coffee, roasted malt, no bourbon"
997,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.79,"2017 Bottle opened with a couple fellow BA members. Would put this ahead of many of the BA stouts I have consumed this year by a large margin. Thick fudge brownie. It was still a bit warming, so I imagine it may have been quite hot when fresh."
998,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.44,"Another winner from Trillium, this looks good, smells delicious and has a ton of citrus notes that showcase grapefruit, clementine, guava, orange peel, lemon, tangerine, biscuit, toasted grains, faint caramel and piney notes. Well balanced and smooth, delicious as usual."
999,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.49,"Fascinating and very complex beer! The chilis come through, but are not overpowering. This is a sipping beer, and I'm glad I had a small pour at the brewery. Great stuff--I've been to Cigar City a number of times, but this is the first time I've seen Hunahpu's on tap. Hooray!"
1000,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.46,"Consumed 9/8/20 Pale golden orange, very hazy, medium size white head that fades to a wispy cap, leaves some lacing"
1001,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.5,Had this at breakers. A: pours a golden body with a. Small white head with ok retention and lacing.
1002,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.43,"Canned on 10/6/20 Pours an opaque, dark sunflower gold body capped with two fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; great head retention yields a rocky, thin cap, an expansive, frothy collar, and layers of ringed, webby lacing spread uniformly around the walls of the glass. Aroma opens with profoundly ripe notes of fresh grass and vegetal/herbal root, given further definition via accents of green grape skins and sweet lime merengue; tangerine brings a citric depth over the middle as white grape must encroaches beneath; peppery melon, creamy mango, and pithy pineapple all contribute varying tropical and earthy touches interspersed throughout the back end and close of the bouquet. Taste shows huge notes of oily, resinous, underripe mango with light accents of white grape must for a balanced initial impression; clementine, tangerine, and underripe lychee soon mark the mid-palate as the increasingly herbal qualities of cantaloupe rind, lime zest, and straw bring an about an earthy finish. Mouthfeel brings a medium body accompanied with a moderate carbonation enabling a fluffy prickle beautifully timed across the mid-palate with a residual, evenly dispersed, and subtle resin; flaky malts beneath a delicate hop acidity peak into a silky back end as a juicy finish 'pops' against an ever-present moderate bitterness. Nelson hops in-focus and refined to near-extremes, the steady malt base levels what becomes a truly fantastic all-around hop composition, so relentlessly poised and yet somehow never underwhelming; the comprehensive structure of the Hill Farmstead DIPA is on full display once more with this brew."
1003,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.51,"After trying DDH Congress, DDH Summer, DDH Sleeper, Dialed In and this one, Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point was perhaps my second favorite. It was incredibly smooth and juicy with the least amount of bitterness of the group and the best, most consistent and even aftertaste. Sleeper and Dialed In were better looking, brighter and hazier. But this is just such a crushable ipa."
1004,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.69,"Went by the brewery Saturday 11/21/19 and picked up a fresh case. Canned 11/22/19, cold and fresh!"
1005,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.44,"From a bottle, pours as black and opaque with a frothy two finger khaki head. Aromas of sweet malts and caramel. Tastes are a complex mix. It's roasted malt-forward with sharp licorice mellowed by creamy chocolate and molasses. Other reviewers mention ""coffee"" and ""hops"" flavors, but I can't find either of those. Overall, this is a world-class beer; I had to double-check that it was brewed in Oregan."
1006,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.45,"Pours a beautiful garnet with an ivory head that dissipates quickly. It smells like dates and raisins with hints of Carmel and brown sugar and just a slight hoppy floralness. The taste is truly incredible with hints of carmel, figs, dates, molasses, and a very slight hop bitterness to compliment the perfect amount of sweetness in this beer. It goes down incredibly smoothly and honestly it would be dangerous to not disclose the alcohol percentage to the drink. Overall truly world class."
1007,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.99,Bought fresh at the brewery on 5/21. This is truly an incredibly made beer. It kind of reminds me of the first time I tried King Sue when I first got into IPAs -- it has the same general qualities of drinkability and flavor burst. I don't know how Tree House makes this drink so smooth.
1008,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.86,"Can't speak to all the vintages, but I was absolutely floored by this beer. Living on the East Coast this beer is obviously a luxury I don't come across often. Vanilla sweetness meets boozy but not overpowering bourbon! Thick and scrumptious mouth feel."
1009,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.44,"A very tasty stout! There's a hint of peanut butter here, but coffee is still the dominant smell/flavor. It's got a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness, and I liked the mouthfeel, which was rich and creamy but not over-heavy and syrupy. I also liked the abundance of dark brown foam on this beer (EDIT: although a recent batch from 9/16/20 was much less carbonated). I think I like the Double Shot/Triple Shot varieties better than this, and I liked Fleeting Moment better too, but this was another very enjoyable stout from Tree House."
1010,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.39,"Pours a hazy yellow with a thin white head on top. The smell has a great fruity aroma. The taste is full of fruity flavors, not overly sour, kind of sweet. The feel is medium bodied. Overall it’s a pretty solid brew!"
1011,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.65,"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. Another part of the deal with @jhavs, Thank you!"
1012,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.44,"Midnight black pour with a thin brown ring and webbing. Huge aromas of vanilla lead the nose, with fudgey chocolate, full bourbon with potent molasses mash, chocolate truffle, hints of marshmallow and light plum liqueur. Amazing in the potency and complexity while keeping vanilla a star. Taste is a relative disappointment, like FO without the impeccable that has the flavors meld together. Bourbon and vanilla are in one camp, and chocolate truffle in another during the sip. Still delicious, but want more integration. Much warmer than FO too, feel is not as smooth or lush, but instead chewy. Still a wonderful stout well worth your time, but much prefer fundamental observation. The wife liked it"
1013,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.31,"Large three finger head, irregular surface, just off shite hue, average retention, thin if extended lacing. Looks the part, apricot juice in a glass. Keen edged dankness to the nose, at times close to pencil lead, strong biscuit component as well, rich peach, apricot, melon to kiwi fruit scents, topped off by pink grapefruit and mint. Full-bodied, lush mouth feel, only starts to turn dry by the finish. Carbonation soft and fluffy, no match for the sugary sweetness of the fruit and citrus. Black tea leaf and cigar wrapper more than marijuana for dankness. Piney here as the melon comes to the fore. No getting much by way of florality. Fleshy and fun, does show some alcohol if allowed to warm. While very good doesn't break away from the pack. (Canned 8/5/21)"
1014,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.48,"Pours a light caramel color with a fine lacy head. Very light tropical aroma. Great big juicy notes on the front of the tongue - enormous hop bite on the finish with a great mouthfeel. Super smooth, all things considered at 100IBUs. Indeed, “a reckless use of hops”. Bottle / Pint glass / No food pairing"
1015,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,3.81,"Look: Nice thick, foamy head, that dissipates rather quickly. Cloudy, orange-amber (4.25) Smell: mellow-soft nose (3.5) Taste: hits dead center, mid-palate; light-medium bodied, stained with sour cherries and oak notes, smooth finish (4) Feel: well-balanced, yet subdued, dry (3.75) Overall: It's as if I am looking for something more here. Good, but not great."
1016,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.48,"Big, dark, and delicious - this stands on the shoulders of the regular DL (which I have always found to be a bit of a letdown). BVDL was of course superior, but I'm a sucker for vanilla, so no surprise there. This is a great beer for sure, but I wouldn't trade a chunk of my cellar away for another taste."
1017,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.84,Had this on tap last weekend at the cellar- look and feel were both light and great for the style. Smell was good but not overwhelming. The taste was off the charts incredible. The best sour I've ever had.
1018,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.64,"killer beer, amazing to have in such close proximity with the westly, which although was apricot and not peaches, makes a great side by side. the beers are similar in some ways, but this was much more interesting on the yeast front, much less sour, equally fruity. peaches rule this one, drippy and ripe just like the namesake, aroma and flavor are the peak of ripeness, hardly sweet at all, just juicy and true, fuzzy and woody and awesome. soft yellowish orange beer, hazy and heady, well carbonated, dry, and who knew it was so strong on the booze? you dont taste it in the least nor feel it at all. brett out in front of souring cultures in this one for me, funky and layered and real mature. this must have spent quite a bit of time ageing, fermenting all this fruit out. the peaches are insane, yellow and bursting out of this. in some ways, the sourness takes over the apricot in westly a bit, here, the fruit leads the way and is merely accentuated by the yeasts. still plenty of acid, but a lot of nuance to it, maybe less wood, but more interesting i think. i like this as much as i liked either westly or fuzzy from side project in isolation, and think if they made more of it, it would have to be one of the most hyped beers ever. its immediately in that range with stuff like fou foune, cascade, allagash, and the other greatest peach or apricot lambics out there. lots of wheaty body, even oaty, fluffy and expansive, inviting, micro bubbles are very active in it too. i couldnt imagine this improving in any way, its a truly beautiful beer. thanks to claystation for sharing it with us, a real treat, and a new high water mark for casey, and thats really saying something if you have been keeping up with their releases lately... edit: leaving my original scores in place, but we drank a batch 1 from ages ago this weekend and it really had changed. acidity ramped way up, peach faded way back, and just a totally different brew, still compelling and complex and delicious by any standard, but a far cry from what it was when it was new and the fruit character was so explosive in here and the funk was on par with the sour. maybe not meant for extended cellaring..."
1019,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.27,"Look: It pours dark yellow and clear with an off white head. Head retention is good.  Smell: It has strong aromas of grapefruit and pine. There are some low resinous qualities to it with additional citrus hints.  Taste: There are grapefruit, pine, and bready flavors. There are additional other citrus flavors with resinous elements and very low melon.  Feel: It has a medium body with strong hop bitterness in the finish.  Overall, a traditional hop bomb, but not overdone or overly sweet. The flavors are well defined and the finish is pleasant and long lasting."
1020,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.1,"This can pour is less than 20 days old. The pour is golden with a slight haze and hosts a 2 cm foam cap. The aroma is slight, pine and a bit of. Iris are noted. The flavor is citrus zest, (orange and lime) with prominent pine and a bready malt back. The hop bitterness is moderate. The mouthfeel is crisp. There is no alcohol heat. This Is quite good."
1021,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.32,Pours straight orange haze. Nice white head. Sticks around with some lacing. 
1022,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.93,"The beer, the myth... the legend. It was of course a divine experience to taste is the first time- however, it’s a beer that you’ll gladly revisit at any chance given. A refreshing and amazing good old East Coast IPA, full of hoppy excitement"
1023,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,3.07,"On-draught at Monkish - a brewery I haven't been to since 5 years ago, when they were adamant about only brewing Belgian ales...so much for that. $9 for 12oz. Looks like pulpy stale juice after pouring, lacking much vibrance or life. No head at all. Looks a bit drab...I eye this the way I eye most nightclub drinks, wondering why I paid so much for so little, and fearing it won't taste all that special. AROMA: Vague fruit juice. Pulp. Mango. Passion fruit. Citrus. Generally appealing, but it seems like hop pungency and bitterness are taking a backseat to the India Odwalla Ale fruit juice aromatics. Pale malts, probably some wheat malt, 2-row. TASTE: Yup...this is an India Odwalla Ale. Lacks any hop pungency at all and fails to deliver in terms of depth of flavour. Mango, fruit creamsicle, citrus, pulp, orange juice, Odwalla. Lacks intricacy or subtlety. It's more alcoholic juice than beer proper. TEXTURE: Creamy, soft, smooth, wet, acidic. Not too thick in spite of its pulpiness. Refreshing. Medium-bodied. OVERALL: It boggles my mind this is currently in the California Top Beers list... it's tired India Odwalla Ale fare that I'd maybe pay $10 per sixer for. I've had beers in this Johnny come lately substyle with far more hop pungency and depth...its drinkability is remarkable but that's about it. If your view isn't from the hype train, you'll see clearly that this is one naked ass emperor. Still, it's likeable and enjoyable so long as you don't mind a purported imperial IPA with less hop pungency than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It's only a matter of time until breweries start pouring sunny delight in the mash... C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE"
1024,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.44,"Poured on draft into a snifter. Nearly black color and viscous looking body. Light beige ring around the rim dissipates leaving no head or lacing. Appearance is attractive but nothing particularly special or out of the ordinary. The aroma is quite nice, mostly a sweet smelling cocoa with a hint of vanilla and spice. The flavor profile is perfectly balanced with no off-tasting notes. Cocoa nibs dance around with coffee and vanilla. Mild ancho chili spice rounds out the taste, keeping this interesting and preventing it from becoming cloying. This is on the sweeter side, and while there is a hint of roasted chocolate malt, it isn’t dry or smoky like some stouts. Highly potent at 13% abv, but the alcohol is masked. The mouthfeel and body is nearly perfect. Overall an outstanding tasting beer with a nice creamy mouthfeel. I’m glad to get a break from all the barrel aging on this one and still enjoy rich and complex flavors."
1025,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"Had this over the fall. Tasted like a fudge brownie. Was very thick, great taste. For 14% was not hot at all. "
1026,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.75,"WOW!!! Just tasted this on tap at Brewski in Brisbane. One of the truly great stouts, IMO. Would have loved to try it alongside CBS, my favorite other stout to date. I would try to expand on this but words cannot do justice to such great beer."
1027,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.48,Pours a touch thin but that is to be expected considering it is a porter. Sits cola brown and opaque in the glass with light khaki foam around the edge of the glass. At first the smell is lactose sweet but as it warms up you get some strong chocolate notes and just a hint of chili pepper. The smell did not prepare you for the explosion of taste when you finally sip it. Sweet chocolate on the front end with a sweet cinnamon Center. Not really any heat to speak of but there are some pepper notes. Not really any specific maple flavor but it is definitely sweet. It feels a touch watery but still has a modicum of body. Overall this beer is excellent. Tastes more like an Italian capuccino than a Mexican stout but I am not complaining.
1028,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.6,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely malts with chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak and coffee just beyond. It has a sweet onset, and then fades slightly towards bitter. Bourbon adds a kiss of heat on the back of the nose, but is far from over powering. Flavor profile is deep and expressive, hitting notes of caramel, vanilla, oak, chocolate, toffee, and bourbon. Roasty, toasty, caramely malts add a firm foundation for the sugary notes. Dark and expressive. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, creamy texture that carries just a touch of grittiness. Overall, dark and expressive, and yet far from overly complex or mind numbing.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz can. 2019 version."
1029,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.38,Bottle: Poured a copper/pink color beer with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of raspberry vinegar with some ripe mango notes is quite unique. Taste is also a mix of ripe fruit notes with some mango and other tropical fruit notes with some tart and raspberry vinegar notes. Body is full for style with good carbonation. Unique take on the style and something I wish I could drink again.
1030,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.75,A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a dense and slightly rocky two fingers of dark tan head which retains well and leaves minimal lacing
1031,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.66,"Poured into a tulip glass via bottle (2016 Edition) color is a mocha brown with tan foam smell is rum, cinnamon, Chilies and chocolate taste is rum soaked chocolate up front , kinda sweet, followed by the apple brandy and chocolate with the spice of the chili heat at the end..lots of flavor here! carbonation is low, and the mouthfeel is thick and creamy top notch stuff!"
1032,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.9,"Wow, this beer is just perfect. Tree House is wonderful, but this is great for Tree House. I totally agree with the 100 score this beer received. Thanks, Tree House... and thanks good friend who sent this to me."
1033,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.26,"Copper colored, hazy, and with no real head. The aroma is of very forward oak and chardonnel grapes. I'm tasting the chardonnel grapes, oak, and very tart microflora. There's nothing subtle about the aggressiveness of the flavors here. The mouth is bone dry, lightly acidic, and offers moderate carbonation."
1034,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.73,"L: Hazy yellow/orange with a thick head and great lacing. S: Peach, grapefruit, mango, guava and black pepper. Subtle bready malt in there as well. T: Moderate bitterness, big juicy flavor. Notes of mango, guava, orange juice and some peach make up the balance. The malt flavor is restrained but does provide a good bready backbone. F: Medium bodied, fairly high carb which makes it crisper. Soft otherwise. Overall: A phenomenal IPA. My second beer after Julius from tree house and it is stellar as well. If you want a juicy IPA with explosive flavor, look no further than Tree House Brewing."

1036,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.48,"Viscous black under a mocha blanket that settles to a thick collar. The distinct aroma of roasted, waxy walnuts hits me first, which is quickly enveloped by decadence: chocolate, peanut butter fudge, and pie crust. Then wet, dark wood and a touch of wafer mix in. The first sip starts sticky with flavors of vanilla rum on the lips, transitioning to nutty chocolate fudge and syrup on the palate. Brittle toffee and deep luscious mocha are spiked with measured bourbon that provides sophisticated notes of smoke and char. The heat is smooth and round through a slick body and a semi-dry finish."
1037,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.59,"Dark brown sluggy beer, some sediment at the bottom. Slick oily mouthfeel, a slight booziness but concealed nicely. raisin, fig, caramel, dark chocolate, some woody oak notes, real solid beer."
1038,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.33,"2012: A little smokiness. Malty and sweet. Super good. 2014: My very first My first Mother of All Storms - sweet and smooth. 2015: A little sharper than 12. Malty and sweet. Still excellent. 2018: Toffee, sweet, smooth - terrific for a fresh barrel-aged barleywine."
1039,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.63,"DDH Double Mosaic Daydream has been on my wishlist for some time now - I was quite happy to try it when a fellow BA reached out to set up a trade. The cans were quite fresh - less than two weeks old - and the beer is tasting fantastic. Poured in to a teku, the color is a lovely golden orange with a thick white head. Carb is light and the mouth feel is very pleasant - just a bit creamy, quite rich, and the finish is decently clean. It's quite definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum, and once it warms up, and trace of bitterness virtually disappears. It's not a particularly balanced beer as far as hops go - it's definitely a very sweet IPA - but it's damn fine for what it is. That milk sugar is certainly present in the creaminess and sweetness! I wouldn't want to sit on these beers - I can't imagine they will age well."
1040,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.59,"Bottled 28 March 2018, received in trade with rodmanfor3.  Jet black with a dark brown head with good retention and lacing. The nose has a lot of dark chocolate, licorice, a little anise, soy, vanilla, a little booze and plums, a little tobacco. Rich and deep.  The palate opens moderately sweet, with plums, dark caramel, dark chocolate and some bourbon. Dark honey, buckwheat honey and licorice follow, with an anise spiciness complementing the bourbon notes. While sweet, this isn't cloying, favoring balance and structure instead ( but what did you expect?). Fruit cake, dessert like and rich, but still approachable and also uncompromising. Flavors of molasses, particularly the bitterness one finds in treacle, temper the sweetness. Full in body, softly, creamily carbonated, this is spectacular on the palate. Luscious, full,creamy and luxuriating. Sweet on the finish with lingering plum and tobacco to go with the leathery booze note, this is quite stellar. This beer is an older school stout barrel aged in an old school way. The flavors lean heavily on the malt, especially the licorice and tobacco notes, and the barrel provides a little heat but also oxidative softness to the flavor profile. Impressive.  Despite my limited description above, there is incredible depth, balance and poise to this beer."
1041,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.5,"Poured from a 12.7 oz bottle into a Jackie O’s tulip glass. Acquired in a trade. Pours a deep black inky body with a small brown head that reduces quickly, leaving little retention. Aromas are potent and inviting, bourbon forward. marshmallows and milk chocolate, bourbon fudge brownies, vanilla, caramel, licorice. On the tongue, caramel and chocolate-vanilla, boozy bourbon soaked dark chocolate brownies, charred oak, roasty dark malt finish that lingers for a bit. Rich body, smooth and velvety. Very easy to drink and smooth for 15%. Overall a very tasty stout, rich, tons of flavor, bourbon is nicely balanced."
1042,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.78,"This might be my favorite Berliner of all time. I managed to get 5 pours of this at GABF last weekend, and I would have gotten more if I had more time. This is insanely sour, fruity, and perfectly carbed."
1043,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.37,"2014 vintage (Woodford Reserve barrels) - very nice incorporation of the base stout, raspberry and barrel notes. The raspberry adds a nice sweetness and jammy notes to a really well done BA stout."
1044,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.46,"A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is hazy yellow-golden with a small white head. S: Big nose of hops - earthy & fruity (pineapple, blueberries) hops. T: Bright, juicy pineapple with lemony blueberries and an earthy dankness. Touch of white wine (Nelson is in the house). Finishes with modest heat felt in the belly but not on the palate. M: Creamy/juicy in feel, medium in heft.  O: Good stuff."
1045,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.05,"Acts exactly like champagne. Foams up immediately, recedes quickly, bubbles rising from nucleation sites on the bottom of the glass. Crazy musty aromas, with a Moscato-like sweetness. Between the musty funk and sweet white wine aromas, the jaw-aching tartness from the first sip is a bit of a shock. The 10% is front and center with tons of white wine, funk, barrel, and a dry as a bone finish."
1046,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.31,"A: Cloudy, dark yellow with no head"
1047,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.33,"22oz bomber poured into two pint glasses. Pours a viscous motor-oil black forming a thin sliver of dense head dark mocha head. The head is finely dotted with thin bubbles, recedes exceedingly slowly, and has excellent retention, leaving moderate lacing. The nose on this beer is bourbon through and through. Chocolate notes are unmistakeable, along with a sweet-biscuit - almost cookie - element that is decidedly unique. The palate follows the nose, opening with boozy bourbon, milk and dark chocolate, and an almost chocolate-chip-cookie-like flavor. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy - not quite on par with the best-of-the-best BB Imp Stouts, but solid. If you had told me that this beer was a slightly more subtle and bourbon barrel aged part of the Southern Tier Blackwater series, I'd hardly be surprised - there's the faintest hint of artificial in the flavoring here: not enough to ruin what is otherwise a very good beer, but enough to be noticed. Ultimately, the various elements of this beer come together to make a very well done Imp Stout. Top of its class? No. Overpriced and overhyped? Without a doubt. But another solid brew from Evil Twin? Most definitely."
1048,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.4,"The beer pours the expected blackish brown color with good head retention and light lacing. On the nose, I pick up considerable dark chocolate, coconut and vanilla, with some underlying bourbon as well. The flavor profile replicates the nose, but I'm impressed by the richness and plush Mouthfeel. This beer is pretty sweet, but the bourbon helps to counter that sweetness a bit. Even so, this is very much a dessert beer, and a sipper at that. Mouthfeel is soft, creamy and full, with a long finish. Alcohol is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell the abv is up there a bit.  Impressive beer from the folks at prairie. The sweetness is a bit much, but otherwise, it's hard to find any flaws in this well crafted beer. This is quite excellent."
1049,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.14,"Shared with a friend while in Europe, bottle dated 2017, which I purchased in January 2018.  Pours an inky, thick opaque back, with coffee-and-cream head that dissipates relatively quickly. Some faint, light lacing on glass. Aroma is earthy malt and dark bread, hint of molasses. Something very vaguely like tequila, which is probably woody character from the barrel aging, but a little spicier than most bourbon barrel stouts I've sampled. Flavour is complex, incredibly smooth and balanced -- hit of dark malty goodness up front, slightly bitter, but immediately followed by a sweet undercurrent of maple and spice, which finishes with a hint of licorice. A big difference with this versus other big barrel-aged beers I've enjoyed is that even the barrel character seems balanced -- this is a pretty solidly crafted brew. No element is over the top. I'm honestly pretty amazed that there is still a slight residual maple flavour here, often the taste of the syrup is lost when the yeast ferment it away. No indication of its strength on the label, but going on taste alone I'd say it's well north of 8-9%. My guess is 10% ABV. The price of the bottle was a bit steep for 375 mL, but this stout was years in the making and I'm glad to have shared it with a friend."
1050,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.6,Pours black with a finger of mocha head.
1051,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.03,"Super cloudy OJ color with a thin half-finger of off-white head that leaves nice rings of lacing. Orange and passionfruit in the nose. Some of that citrusy, tropical flavor carries over to the taste, as well as some cream, but it’s stepped on by strong herbal bitterness with hints of grass and pine. Soft, full-bodied feel with a little zip to the carbonation. Good, but the original is near-perfect. The extra hops in this version aren’t an improvement."

1053,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.58,"(Blind review) L - 2-finger dense hazelnut head recedes as slow as a glacier. Body is pitch black. Clearly a stout. S - Tons of cinnamon. Milk chocolate, vanilla, maple?. Not smelling much booze so at all, so guessing non-BA adjunct stout. T - so much cinnamon spice on the taste too. Coffee, vanilla, drinking chocolate. Low bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness. F - medium-full, super-creamy body with low carb. O - what a decadent dessert stout."
1054,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.75,"This beer is awesome, wish they would bottle it so I could have it all the time. Loved this beer and going to Alpine is a great brewery to visit. The nicest guys ever there. Looking forward to this being released again"

1056,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.1,"Bottled late spring 2016; drank 6/23/16 @ the Yarchives.  Semi-opaque bright orange appearance; champagne bubbles throughout.  A rough pour yielded a nice, noisy white head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lace.  Melon, fresh ganja & grapefruit notes in the nose.  Medium thick mouthfeel.  Melon, orange peel & fresh ganja flavors up front; mild grapefruit bite on the finish. No booze heat.  Fruity; dry but not drying. A flavorful, drinkable DIPA. Well done!"

1059,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.09,"I'm not sure what's so special about this beer. Matt? Do you know how many people I know in this world named Matt? I mean, Matheus, now there's a beer. This one is aptly named as it seems pretty common to me."
1060,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.55,"Review #1100 This was a very nice coffee flavored imperial stout. I’ve been wanting to try a beer from this highly-lauded brewery for a long time and was finally able to find this one on Tavour. 2019 date printed on the bottle. Pours a very thick syrupy jet-black opaque color with some nice tan-mocha head and some very spotty lingering lacing. I wish that the lacing would have persisted longer, but I did really enjoy the appearance of the liquid itself. Smells incredible, deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, malt, toasted nuts and a little cinnamon. I really couldn’t detect chili peppers in the aromas. Taste follows the nose, great balance, depth and complexity. At the finish there was a very mild note of chili peppers, although without any corresponding heat. This was a sipper of a beer, but the high ABV was still fairly well hidden and this paired well with both savory dinner and sweet dessert. Coffee was neither acidic nor sour, and was actually very well done considering other coffee stouts tend to go crazy on the coffee infusion. This one had just the right amount of reserve. Smooth, thick, syrupy, creamy mouthfeel that coated the palate. Just the right amount of carbonation. An excellent beer!"
1061,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.92,Deep red color and nice thick head. Well carbed and easy to drink blend which really presents a delicious raspberry flavor without overwhelming the base beer. Impressive balance as SP shows some restraint on the berries.
1062,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.63,"Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a belgian beer glass at 53.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Look- Dark brown, visible particulate sediment, tan sudsy head, below average head retention, average lacing. Smell- Sweet, caramel, coffee, toasted oats, raisin, bourbon. Taste- Caramel, coffee, slight oak, raisin, plum, fig, bourbon. Feel- Between medium and full body, slightly below average carbonation, smooth, subtly coats and warms the mouth."
1063,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.71,"Thanks so much to djmichaelk for sending me this long time want. Appearance is basically motor oil. Thick and black as fuck, with the darkest colored head I think I've ever seen on a beer. Damn. Jesus, smells like calories. Crazy intense sweet dark malt, chocolate and vanilla, hints of cinnamon. Tastes like a laundry lists of great imperial stout flavors: chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, whiskey, chili. This is amazing. Insanely thick. Just insanely thick. And yet I can't stop drinking it. This is awesome... 9.6/10"
1064,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.4,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Dogfish Head tulip L: Cloudy bright golden pour with big foamy white head. Outstanding retention and lacing. S: Fresh and citrusy. Pineapple, spice, and fruit. T.F: Semi-sweet up front. Light malts and lush fruit. Loads of pineapple... tangerine and rind mixed in. Mango and papaya... a big of pepper and a bit of cotton candy. Medium bodied... smooth and creamy mouthfeel. O: A fantastic DIPA. Super flavor and drinkability. I could drink this every day."
1065,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.37,"From 16oz can marked CANNED ON 11/11/20 F5166 11:41 Pours into my tulip a luminous brassy shade with a creamy frothy off white head and tons of sticky fluffy lace. Scent is pineapple, tropical fruit, grapefruit, pine, crusty bread. Spicy hop notes. Taste is tropical fruit, caramel, honey, citrus, grapefruit and a nice piney bitter finish. Citrus. Some stone fruit - apples, pear, peach. Fairly high ABV is hidden well even as the beer warms. The malt bill tastes substantial with a sweet bready backbone for the hops to flesh out. Mouth is oily and coating with a nice viscosity and an astringent finish. Well I've long wanted to try this and finally got the chance. My can is not the freshest (3 months) and this DIPA is still magnificent. Can only imagine how it must be when very fresh."
1066,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.64,This beer is a coconut bomb! So good to go with the shavings. Would drink this everyday if the week if I could. Amazing stout for sure. Gotta get more.
1067,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.82,"absolutely beautiful beer ... dark pour with a frothy mocha head that hangs around for a while and leaves sheets of lace on the glass. aromas are bourbon soaked chocolate, molasses, and roasty malt. opens up on palate with a huge blast of vanilla and delicate caramel character, sweet milky chocolate, toffee, candied wheat, mellow earthy coffee roast, molasses, and dark roasted malt. there is an assertive and slightly spicy bourbon flavor but its so well integrated into the rest of this robust and complex beer that it manages to be simultaneously bold and restrained. mouthfeel is medium+ and oh sooo lush ... not quite sludgy but just perfect for this brew. overall im blown away, this might be the best BA stout ive tasted."
1068,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.8,"Was a 2005 bottle Look was a nice hazy typical geuze color. Smell was funky and sour Taste was very low carb, very sour, nice mouth feel very smooth funky notes in beginning to end. Little flat on the taste but was a good flat taste with oak and age coming through."
1069,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.07,"375 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Appearance - Hazy orange body. Small white head. Thin collar. Smell - Lots of grape. Musty. White wine is strong. Acidic and woody. Taste - Sour. Sour white grapes. Oaky. White wine builds into the back. Mouthfeel - Medium light. Not as strong as other Side Project sours. Overall - Finally, a pleasant sour from Side Project. Lots of grape, but not that intense on the sour."
1070,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.78,"Tasted from 2013 bottle. Pours jet black with tan head. Not much head. Lots of caramel, molasses, maple, bourbon on the nose. Thick and chewy mouthfeel with a little alcohol heat. Flavors of bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, cocoa, coffee, vanilla. Huge complex beer that is incredibly well done."
1071,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.44,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Pitch black colour, low tan head. Aroma first of fusel alcohols, then molasses, rum oak cask, vanilla, coconut, chocolate and roast malts. Rich and warming mouthfeel. Outstanding flavour, medium sweet and roasty, no sign of fusel, otherwise all the delicious notes from the aroma are repeated and strengthened here. Nice chili heat in the finish. Perfect!"
1072,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.16,"Aroma of tart cherries, spices (clove, something vaguely like gingerbread), lightly phenolic. Like sniffing a spicy holiday cake with some prunes or raisins baked in. Thin persistent off-white head, faint lacing. Colour is an opaque cola brown. Flavour is rich -- bready -- but with noticeable hop bitterness. A bit sharper than Westmalle Dubbel, my personal favourite. More spices here, not overly sweet up front but a little sticky in the finish, aftertaste has a pleasant drying astringency that avoids the cloying character of some other (mainly domestic/North American) Belgian beers of similar appearance. Alcohol is not overly present, but is hard to miss. It's a warming brew, to be sure. The fruit character is tilted towards the plum/raisin/prune side of things. Carbonation is noticeable but not excessive, has an almost creamy mouthfeel. All in all, a very interesting, subtle and complex beer. The standout feature for me is the balance of malt/sugar-derived fruit character and hop bitterness. I actually prefer Westmalle Dubbel, but this is an excellent beer on its own. I'm not blown away, but it's enjoyable and worth trying. I wouldn't go out of my way to sample it again, unlike fresh Westvleteren VI, which is well worth the effort."
1073,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.0,"Appearance: Arrives cloudy and goldenstraw colored with a one finger head; a shard or two of lacing Smell: Pineapple, passionfruit, guava, lychee, lime and grapefruit tones; somewhat grassy and herbal  Taste: Tropical flavors forward, with the pineapple, guava and lychee making an appearance; through the middle, pithy grapefruit bitterness emerges along with passionfruit and lime, producing a rather bitter finish Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate to high carbonation Overall: Elements of both NE and West Coast in this solid IPA"
1074,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.13,Beautiful red slightly pinkish color with a thin head.
1075,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.65,"Loved this. Poured very dark...almost pitch black. Smell has some sweetness and coffee notes. Flavor is a wonderful medley of coffee followed by subtle sweetness (from the barrel?). Feel is excellent, good carb. Overall, another magnificent beer by HF."
1076,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.25,"Pours a clear reddish brown with decent foamy head that fades quickly. Nice aroma of oaky wine and sour cherries. Flavor is tart cherries, oaky tannins, big dose of sourness, bordering vinegary. Very tangy and acidic. Overall I am glad I tried it, might have held it too long... 3/22/20"
1077,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.73,"Tasted from draft. Pours black with beige head. Aroma of strawberry, vanilla and cocoa. Taste is really just how you would want a neopolitan beer to taste. Not overly sweet. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Interesting and excellent tasting beer."
1078,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.52,Cloudy orange appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is s pleasant citrus. Taste is also a rich citrus that is very smooth and no alcohol aftertaste.
1079,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.75,"Received two cans in trade from DanPing (great trader), in exchange for some Tree House brews. My second brew from these guys. Absolutely outstanding, one of the best brews I have ever had."

1081,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.48,"I have had a few of these through the years, always excellent but for whatever reason 2019 feels a bit boozy at the end, prior years loved the roasty grainy after taste. Still better than 90-95% of what is out there."
1082,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.96,"Poured this from fridge temp. Pours a nice dark brown with virtually no head. Looks super clean in the glass - very inviting. The nose....oh my the nose. Might be the best nose of any beer on the planet. Huge toffee and bourbon. Plums and figs. All of the notes are so pronounced. Nothing is being held back on this beer, which isn't surprising given the 13.5% ABV. Also picking up some yeast, vanilla, black currant, and sweet candy. I just can't stop smelling this beer! Taste is out of this world. Huge caramel smacks you in the face immediately upon sipping. Alcohol burns slightly on the back end. In the middle, there is a complex interaction between dark fruit (blackberries, currant, figs, cherries), bourbon, and nutty/bread flavors. I am just amazed by this beer. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, viscous, and chewy. Coats the mouth and lingers for a long time. Overall, one of the best beers I have tasted. I hope to find another one at some point in the future."
1083,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,3.96,"Had a 2017 bottle poured into a Teku and savored. Pours a little more viscous than most other beers, which I regard as a good sign. It pains me to do it because I appreciate the effort that went into this beer, but I rate it a category below ""world class"". This is a big, complex, and great beer, but it aims higher than it achieves. The 3 main components of this beer are plainly evident immediately upon drinking it: imperial stout, honey, and barrel-aging. This does give it a lot of complexity, especially as IS is complex to begin with and then you add honey and BA. But one flaw is that these 3 elements do not combine together to create something new. They exist side by side. Another fault is the use of honey, which doesn't work as well as you would like. I love honey. Especially on hot biscuits where its cloying sweetness is the perfect foil to the starchy biscuit, especially with butter. With this beer, you get just the cloyingness, without really balancing anything. The honey also adds a definite silkiness to the mouth feel. Some people no doubt really like this silkiness, but I'd rather not have it. I can't help think that the use of a different, more caramelized sweetener might have worked considerably better in fusing together the IS and BA flavors to create something really special. Something like maple syrup or brown sugar instead of honey. On the plus side, they held the honey back enough so that it is not a sweet beer; it finishes with a strong and excellent bitterness. It has a world class finish, but then I remember the cloying honey flavor and that the BA flavors don't seem to add much, but just go along for the ride, and I realize there is room for improvement. I hope to be in Truckee in December to try one of these on draft, but I am not currently planing to acquire more of this one."
1084,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.0,Picked-up two cans at Tree House Brewery in Charlton for about eight dollars each. My one hundred and forty second brew from these guys. Probably my least favorite stout from these guys.
1085,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.91,"Pours pitch black motor oil. One finger tan foam. Dissipates After a swig or two. Smell is chocolatey fudge and raisin, light coffee and roasted malt. Taste follows suit but seems a lot more boozey than original KBS which I rated much higher. There is some vanilla here but not much. Some oak and charcoal flavors. I couldn’t get past the bourbon flavors to distinguish and appreciate the rest. Okay beer but won’t buy again"
1086,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.9,Side-by-side at Lambik O Droom. All of them had that signature green apple and barnyard funk but I'm gonna focus more on what distinguishes them from each other/from typical bottles of Oude Geuze.
1087,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.71,"2016 bottle. Pours a viscous jet black. Nose is bakers chocolate, smoke, leather, bourbon, brown sugar and time. Taste follows with dark stone fruit, cherry, plum, raisin , cardboard and old books. Mouthfeel in moderate to full. Surprisingly great with some age."
1088,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.51,"At last: Everett. After so many missed opportunities - here he sits, in a chilled growler not more than two weeks old. Welcome to my home, brother - please make yourself comfortable; we’ve saved you a seat.  Split two ways; enjoyed by all. Pours a charcoal black with a cardboard-colored head that lingers. On par with the good looking crowd of the style. Neither outstanding nor detracting.  Adjunct-free aroma is just fucking amazing. French roast, toasted grains, char, chocolate. Unreal. Balanced: sweet, bitter and charred.  Taste is a malt-forward mix of fresh coffee grounds, toasted grains, dark chocolate and bitter hops.  So smooth. Extremely drinkable; not delicate in the least but still a complex drinking experience with its cascade of flavors that washes over the palate with each sip. Minimal ingredients, huge body."
1089,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.7,"Straw yellow color, no head or retention, but a nice mild carbonation. Smell is rich of floral, musty fruit. Sweet, long finish is mildly acidic. Awesome"
1090,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.62,"Very Special Old Jacket, indeed! The hype train is real here. Thanks to my man, Julian Catanzaro, for snagging this gem for me. One of the better barleywines out there!"
1091,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.83,"It's truly a great stout. I remember when it used to be affordable. Despite the price per bottle of this brew it's still definitely one that you should try if you haven't. Sweet and viscous with a little bit of an anise flavor in the finish, it's a brew I wish I could get more of."
1092,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.46,"Pours a bright, completely opaque, orange color. Thick, sudsy off white head forms, then dissipates leaving a quarter inch of foam in the glass along with plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma has notes of tangerine, orange marmalade, grass, dried vegetation and a slight woody character to it. Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange, orange marmalade, and peach giving way to a grassy, vegetal, woody hop character on the back end. Clearly the Riwaka are coming through on the back end. Moderately bitter, mildly sweet, completely delicious. Feel is moderately bodied, smooth, and pretty easy drinking. Moderate carbonation. This is a really nice IPA from Hill Farmstead - they get so much out of the hops both in the aroma and taste, its impressive."
1093,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.88,"Pours out the most sinful black conceivable. Even poured aggressively this yields no head whatsoever. Looks like syrup being poured into my glass. Nose is pure decadence. Chocolate cake, huge vanilla pastry, caramel, brown sugar, and mild notes of coconut. This smells like dessert. I don't get any bourbon or wood scents surprisingly. But this is captivating so far. Taste is an initial combination of mildly roasty malt and ridiculous amounts of vanilla. Fudgey, gooey, chocolatey cake, vanilla cake and pastry, caramel, toffee, and toasted coconut on the back end. I don't get very much bourbon in the taste as well. This is an absolutely delicious brew. Unreal. Unlike anything I've had before. A touch on the sweet side. Some contrast may be needed. Like a pretzel or a bagel. Something savory. But don't let it detract from the flavor too long. Revel in this. Mouthfeel is like syrup. Dense, sticky, fullbodied. Cloying, which is to be expected, but not so much so. Minimal carbonation. Overall this is pretty much exactly what the description says. A waffle cone filled with German Chocolate cake and topped with burnt caramel. It's amazing how accurate that is. Brews like this is why stouts are my favorite. The amount of complexity and depth in this brew is fantastic. Now the price point is $50 dollars, which makes it on the expensive side of things, but this is meant as a one time experience meant to accent a very particular night. I drank this while reading Battle Ground, the 17th installment of the Dresden Files, and it accompanied it perfectly."
1094,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.34,"Batch 2 consumed 2/8/2020 strong vanilla, mild bourbon, slightly hot. But for 18% quite good, but think I like bcbvs more. Think this could get better with some cellaring"
1095,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.7,"L: Hazy orange/yellow capped by a fluffy off white head with good lacing. S: Bright tropical fruit juice, peach, and candied malt. Very intense aroma. T: Tons of juicy pineapple, mango, and peach with a gentle bitterness. The malt is very bready but also has a touch of caramel candy flavor. F: Lush, creamy, but dry. Overall: An absolutely amazing beer. They got the absolute best out of their hops and created a complex and juicy IPA the likes of which I have never seen."
1096,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,3.98,**
1097,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,3.58,"The color of the body is a dark woody brown topped with a creamy blanket dying to a thin tan ring leaving wavy lace swept away by slowly descending clear legs. Aroma is sharp and woody with caramel, dark fruits and cigars. Taste is woody and surprisingly chocolatey, as un-aged Adam was as well. I also get dark fruit and old, but nonetheless boozy, musty whiskey. Smoother and a little thicker than the peach treatment we got, it's still hot, thin and dry."
1098,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.64,"Nice bit of Brett on the nose. Bigger, bolder body than many HF base saisons. Sweetness is matched by the Brett and wine character. White grape. Some fruit cocktail juiciness. Lower carb than typical. Balanced notes from the barrel, Brett, and fruit flavors. Guessing the fruit comes from the barrel and maybe hops. Very interesting beer and quite delicious."
1099,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.39,"375 ml corked and caged bottle, Blend 57 season 17|18, bottled 22 MAY 18, best before 26 OCT 38, label says 6.8% ABV. Served in a Beer Advocate Teku, the beer pours a slightly hazy dark gold color with about a half inch white head that stuck around a while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like funk, honey, oranges, apricot and wheat/grainy malt. For the most part I think the taste is pretty much like the aroma, but there's also some vanilla, hay, citrus zest, pear, green apple and white grape flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth but has low/moderate carbonation. Other than the low carbonation, I thought this was a pretty good beer. Definitely worth seeking out!"
1100,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.34,"CANNED ON 05/09/18 Pours an opaque peachy haze topped with a pillowy layer of white foam. Fragrant tropical hop saturated nose...mango and apricot slices, grapefruit, pine needles, and a faint leafy herbal spice. Heavy Citra hop flavors - bold and fruity leaving lingering oily resins on the tongue. Peach, mango, zesty citrus, pine sap, and a general fresh hop earthy greenness. Smooth and frothy, fairly heavy for an APA, but stays drinkable thanks to a super crisp finish. Good stuff...essentially an IPA."
1101,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,3.03,"Look: fairly clear, but not totally, gold with a very slight lean toward amber Smell: slight sweetness with some tropical notes Mouthfeel: Medium body Taste: Tropical hop richness, perhaps less full than Zero Gravity's Madonna, with a grassy pretty bitter finish. Overall: At the end of the day, this one leans a bit to bitter for me.  Its well-made, but not really my thing... reminds me of the plethora of IPAs from 5-10 years ago, all trying to out bitter each other.  I enjoyed it for what it was, as the 8.2% most definitely hit my head hard, but wouldn't seek it out in the future."
1102,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.25,"Omega Point tasted like a subdued version of a malted chocolate covered raisin with a muted barrel presence poking through toward the end.  Overall, nowhere near some of the better barleywines out there, but for the price that I paid (free), it was enjoyable."
1103,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.73,"Opened 3/27/2020  Poured from fridge temp. Pours a black color with minimal dark tan head. Nose is toasted coconut, cinnamon, and slight coffee, chocolate, caramel/panela sugar. Reminds me of Samoa cookies. Taste follows the nose, strong coconut, and then cinnamon and coffee, and warmth from barrel. Very well blended. Additionally, get caramel/panela sugar. Like dunking a Samoa in coffee. Feel is perfect for this type of stout viscous, coats mouth, minimal carb. Overall, to date the best dessert stout I have had. Samoa cookies with cinnamon and a side of coffee in the morning. Ideally, the barrel would shine a little more, but it is still present"
1104,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.6,"Caramel apple, fruit leather, and a wave of oak w/ hint of orchard rot on the finish. When cold, what it lacks in complexity it gains in its expression of candied fruit, which evolves from a bold apricot-like sweetness to a drying apple skin/orchard rot/barrel tannin character on the finish. Although it wasn't aged in Cognac barrels, the fruity quality and heat on the finish gives the impression of Cognac or at least some fortified wine. When it warms, though, it shifts gears: fruit leather base tones blend with gentle mid tones of toffee cookies, molasses, and brown sugar. Almost goes into B4K browned butter/crispy pancake edge territory, but instead veers into a wonderful fruit leather zone. Delicious"
1105,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.59,"Silky smooth--you'd think it was a nitro pour, but it wasn't. Big maple flavor throughout, accompanied by chocolate and coffee in support. Almost jet black with a dark tan foamy head. Spectacular consistency from top of the glass to bottom. A true dessert beer, but why not start earlier--in the morning, with a stack of pancakes!"
1106,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.22,"Canned on 6/2/20 Pours a turbid, deep golden mango hue and topped with over two fingers of fluffy, thick white foam; incredible, lasting head retention eases down to a creamy finger of cap and a rich, fluffy collar, while moderate rings of lacing, along with a webby spatter, mark the sides of the glass. Aroma opens with tangerine zest, overripe tropical fruit rinds, mushy grapefruit, and a slight tone of incense, steadily transitioning into an underlying yet encompassing exceedingly dank hop note of redolent of well-executed Simcoe; a vague mango cream on the close hints at a rounded sweetness. Taste features a soft amalgam of pineapple, passionfruit, underripe kiwi, and light peach zest striking first; a crisp, refined, and wheaty malt backbone is subtle but undoubtedly present to balance the fruity tones, while an increasingly musty herbal hoppiness shines calmly past the finish. Mouthfeel presents a deft, airy medium body bolstered by a prickly, moderate carbonation; subtly taut and resinous across the mid-palate as a gritty, well-dispersed bitterness glides along the back end and into a semi-crisp, vaguely juicy finish. Though unquestionably a NEIPA in form, the structure of this beer enables an alternating experience where fruity sweetness, dank hops, and malty crispness all share an opportunity to shine; essentially, a highly nuanced execution of Simcoe hops resulting in a sly, dank, and quaffable showcase of the more restrained aspects (re: less sweet) of the style."
1107,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.13,Bottle:
1108,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.35,"12oz can into a pint glass, courtesy of friend Greg. Canned 6/21/19, so 2 months old.  Bright golden yellow body, faintly hazy, decent white head which dissipates to a solid covering leaving good lacing. Delightful aroma Pine and citrus notes fighting it out on the nose, with pine coming out just ahead.  On the taste, they battle it out again, this time citrus comes out in front. A little warmth comes through towards the end, the only hint of the abv, as this one is extremely drinkable. Mouth between medium and full, finish a little sweet.  Overall, a very good and tasty double IPA, and one I've been after for a while. Thanks Greg!"
1109,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.88,"Nose is of course clearly maple, all bait the beer itself is highly coffee dominated/driven. (To a somewhat surprising level I must say). A superb stout."
1110,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,"Picked-up a single can in a trade. This is my fifth brew from these guys, all outstanding. Canned-on date of 2/8/19. Great brew, wish it wasn't 4 hours away, & would like to see transition to 16-oz cans."
1111,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.35,"On tap at Morris Tap and Grill in Randolph. Pours a jet black ebony hue with minimal frothing. Complex aroma replete with hints of chocolate, and cream. Good stuff. Recommended."
1112,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.52,"2017 version poured into a KBBS snifter. This is wonderfully thick, low on carbonation with a very nice bourbon presence. Rich and reminded me of Bourbon County which I enjoy a great deal."
1113,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.68,One of the best stouts I've ever had. Just so drinkable. Creamy coffee and chocolate just dance on the palate like a fluffy pillow. Outstanding. My rear end would need its own zip code if I had ready access to this.
1114,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.74,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a frothy tan head. The bottle gushed when I opened it. It smells and tastes of maple syrup, coffee, creams brûlée, vanilla, and warm bourbon. The feel is slick and smooth."
1115,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.31,"Batch 6. Glowing golden yellow in color. Hazy in appearance. Brett, lemon, and grannysmith apple. Wine tang. Bright. Perfect level of sweetness and carb. Creamy feel. Balanced. Delicious."
1116,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.89,22 oz. Bomber
1117,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.5,"A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is juicy/hazy yellowish-gold with a small bubbly white head that disappears fast. S: Very nice nose of tropical fruit - mango, papaya, ripe melon, pineapple - with a bit of ripe peaches.  T: Follows the nose, with juicy tropical fruit up front: pineapple-orange juice, ripe sweeter tropical fruits (mango, papaya), sweet ripe peaches and apricots, earthy melon rind and leafy green hops. Finishes with a nice tannic bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. Good balance between sweet up front, bitter at the finish.  M: Creamy, juicy feel. Medium in heft.  O: Very good beer - I like this hop profile."
1118,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.46,"Just lucked out on being in the right place at right time as I was driving from Fl to Me. I honestly didn’t know that TH did stouts as I have only been at the new brewery one time before. I am so glad that I got this one. My fav beers are RIP’s, stouts and the dark styles and TH really hit a home run with this for me . This is OMG good. A wonderful blend of things that all work together beautifully. I only bought two bottles and now wish I had bought more as I am sipping it for the first time. Just had the second bottle, 8/31/19 and I liked even more than the first bottle. Had to kick my wife and dog out of a fully packed car to buy more. Just didn’t have a good feel to leaving my wife and dog at Tree House. Bummer."
1119,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,5.0,"I had this on tap. No idea of its strength until afterwards. This pours a murky oil black with cocoa foam. Incredible aroma. Jammy, raisin and stone fruit, some maple and wisp of tobacco. Long lingering finish. The abv is imperceptible even as it warms. Amazing beer."
1120,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.5,Sipped from a snifter on 11/2/2020. I've not been much of a fan of Three Floyd's IPA in the past but this is quite tasty and my favorite by them to date.
1121,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.38,"all of the beers we had at hair of the dog were highlights, so its hard to single out this 2008 matt as the standout, but it was pretty darn impressive. no idea what it tasted like fresh, but some time in the bottle has really done it well. one of the few beers i can think of that could stand up over time like this, not a lick of oxidation or staleness in here at all, just a smooth mellow well integrated brew all the way around. rich syrupy viscous dark dark brown pour, still with a little bubbling head on it. notes of campfire, black licorice, cigar, brandy, raisin, and dark chocolate all waft out from the glass slowly and patiently, weaving a complex aromatic tapestry that is entirely unique. burnt leather and bourbon come through the dark english or german malts, rauch type smoke has mellowed some, sticky bread pudding, root beer, then they apple grappa stuff in the finish. man is this layered! it doesnt quite have that roasted barley stout quality to it, it doesnt go that deep, but in its bitter absence, there arises this space for other flavors usually lost to it, and i think this lands perfectly in the middle of all of them. i am amazed how this has done over time, i expected more of a novelty at this age, but that wasnt the case at all. rich and velvety on the palate, the warming alcohol seems necessary too. brilliant beer, what a treat!"
1122,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.59,Look - thick and black with a nice tan head
1123,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.65,"Incredible look, strong golden hue, great clarity. It poured with a nice 1/2 inch of foam, laced around the glass. As refreshing as it looked, I had a fantastic full mouth feel, effervescent. Although a double, it’s subtle and easy to drink. There is a pronounced hoppiness that clears. It’s just overall refreshing. Tantalizing citrus, nectarine bouquet. Excellent!"
1124,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.34,"Very muted in aroma but is a well balanced smooth stout that is dangerously drinkable at 16%. I get flavors of chocolate espresso, bourbon, and dark fruit."
1125,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.15,"Deep copper color with a fingernail of off white around the rim. The aroma is piney and honey sweet. I taste a massive amount of piney hops. The mouth is thick, chewy, and overall dense."
1126,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.46,"16oz can dated 3/30/18. Cloudy yellow body with a moderate head and retention. White grape, mango, peach, and grapefruit in the nose. Medium bodied with a creamy, crisp mouthfeel. Juicy tropicals on the palate with zero malt and a firm, drying bitterness. Peach, grapefruit, and white grape. Finishes with plenty of lingering unripe peach.  Great beer, tastes like a Congress street light."
1127,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,5.0,"Pours pitch black, almost no head. "
1128,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,The Best. It really doesn't disappoint. The vanilla works flawlessly with the barrel presence and the base beer. I chased this for a long time and trying it was worth the wait.
1129,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.71,"07/2015 - Bourbon, maple syrup, chocolate syrup, dark fruit, notably cherries; luscious, nice roastiness, super chocolaty, maple syrup for dayzzzz. Very tasty, very satisfied."
1130,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.27,L: Golden yellow color.
1131,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.29,"Appearance - Poured into a sampler, the beer was a murky deep black color with a dark tan head.  Smell - Raspberries were strong in the nose, paired with a definite bourbon presence.  Taste - Raspberry is tough to capture in a beer. The raspberry seemed fresh, without overdoing it or making it seem artificial. The sweetness is balanced by roasted malts and a little bourbon sting. The finish was slightly warming, though never overly sweet.  Mouthfeel - Before there were slushies with gobs of fruit puree, Haymarket made a nice thick stout with fruit.  Overall - I enjoyed this beer as the raspberries were well presented and not artificial tasting."
1132,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.86,2018 2-year BB4D
1133,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.74,"Canned 2/2. Hazy yellow orange, mild head and lacing. Dank and citrusy on the nose, piney resin popping in there. Taste is balanced bitterness, dankness, and juiciness. Medium bodied, mouth watering, well disguised alcohol presence. Like Jjjuliusss!, I’m wondering if this has fallen off. Is it great? Undoubtedly. Top ten? Not sure."
1134,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.73,"Prior to tasting, I wanted to hate it. I wanted to love it. "
1135,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.5,"Brought out to do a side by side with the regular...Brandon you're the man. The beer pours jet black with the same dominating viscosity and residual oil left on the inside of the glass while drinking. The nose has notes of buttery apple brandy, oak, and booze. The taste is sweet, rich, and boozy, but so balanced and smooth it's nuts. The apple isn't as prominent as expected, but there is a slightly tart, apple aftertaste that's an exceptional addition to one of my all time favorite stouts. Excellent beer that's completely worth the acquisition hassle (that I myself didn't have to do)."
1136,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.06,Very Green from Treehouse. Received on 9/4/21 from @Rub_This_BBQ in NBW BIF #13. 16 oz can stored upside-down at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 14/4/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
1137,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.17,"16oz can received as a gift from a friend. Purchased directly from the brewery. Canned on 9/22/2020 with ""Gimme the Green"" stamped on the bottom, so this is almost 3 months old. Look: Pours a hazy golden orange color. A nice soft one-finger head with decent retention. The beer became much hazier when I swirled and poured the bottom of the can. Then it looked like unfiltered pineapple juice. Smell: Interestingly enough, the nose on this beer is quite green. It's almost hard to pick up other notes because the vegetal and green notes are so dominant. Up front, there is a lot of stinky and rank oniony notes which are interesting yet personally not so desirable when present in such a dominant fashion. Very earthy as well. Those notes yield to some nice tropical flavors of papaya and orange on the finish, which are a bit hard to pick out because the green notes are so strong. As green as the beer seems to be, the aroma has a lingering sweet and juicy finish. There's also a lot of chalkiness in the nose, and that is probably due to the age of the beer. Taste: This NEIPA is probably one of the more bitter ones that I have had and I'm not sure how I feel about it. I like the juicy beers to have a bitter foil to them, but I feel like this one goes beyond the use of kryptonite. I also just have to wonder how much of the intended beer I am missing because I am not tasting it at its freshest. Up front, there is a lot of tropical juicy sweetness - notes of orange juice, unripe pineapple, and papaya. The mid-palate of the beer was fine, but unremarkable and that is probably what i am missing most from the lack of freshness here. The finish is soft yet nicely pithy, green, and bittering to help balance out all the sweetness and juiciness, lingers long, and also leaves a remnant of salinity and juiciness on the palate that is quite pleasant. I feel like I experienced two versions of the same beer in this can: the first half that was mildly hazy, lighter in body, more balanced, and more enjoyable, and the second half that was super cloudy, more pillowy, bitter, chalky, and unbalanced. Feel: Soft and pillowy. Appropriately carbonated. Overall: My second Tree House beer. I don't think that it has been done proper justice as these NEIPAs generally don't age so well. Granted that it has been in my fridge for a while as it has been hard to find the right opportunity to enjoy it, but in my defense I must note that this was given to me by a friend when it already had close to 2 months time on it. All this being said, I think that it is still evident that it is a well-made beer; it toally just needs to be enjoyed fresher. I look forward to being able to re-review this one when I can enjoy a fresher offering. As an aside It also puzzles me as to why some hoppy beers can do just fine with a bit of age, yet other ones change so much and almost fall apart. I would love to understand this more!"
1138,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,3.86,"Pours a cloudy orange colored beer with a medium white head, collapsing instantly. Smells of ripe apricots, fresh cut flowers, lime zest and wet grass. Got a prominent mushroom funk quality to it, together with cream cheese and moldy earth. Has a light, mellow mouthfeel with an uprising effervescence during the finish.  Got a mellow potato peel yeast softness to it, opening up the palate to the beers herbal, prominent funkiness. Turns more sour once the beers effervescence unfolds, bringing apricot pulp and subtle lime zest to the palate. Finishes heavier on the fruits, earth, funk and a long lasting lime bitterness, building up a perfect balance for the apricots. This is nice, not your typical awa at all with a well established sourness, which accompanies the apricots perfectly well. The funkiness creates a subtle complexity which guides through the whole experience, highlighting the fruits incredibly well."
1139,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.26,16 oz. can - 18 Days Fresh A: Pours a bright golden peach color. Hazy. Large fizzy white head. No retention and no lacing.  S: Not a terribly strong aroma but what is there is very nice. Citrus flavors and such. Gets better as it warms. T/M: Bitter hops. Pine. Tropical fruits. Mango. Good balance. Sweeter malts. Grapefruit. Light bodied with a thin mouthfeel. Smooth. Moderate carbonation. Aftertaste is citric and a little bitter. Flavors come out better as it warms.  O: I can definitely see this beer being world class when it first came out but now its just on par with other real good brews. Still excellent tho.  Cheers!!
1140,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.61,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a pure black color with a creamy dark brown head of one finger after a hard pour.  Smell is creamy with chocolate and mocha and vanilla. Not really toasty which is what I would have expected from this, but really like a candy bar. But this is not just a sugar bomb, it seems pleasantly sweet smelling, not cloyingly so. Not much in the way of pepper aroma. Chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream, slight coffee way in the back. Mocha throughout. Spicy note comes in at the very end, almost in the throat, as a slight sting after swallowing. Balanced. Not super complex, but what it does it does super well. Incredibly smooth. A real dessert beer for sure, but not sugary. It's like a quality fudge. I had high hopes for this one, and it didn't disappoint."
1141,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.68,"I don’t know. I really don’t. Like, who cares? You might as well imprison me like Paul Newman working a chain gang, or tell me that the world has been destroyed like when Charleston Heston was messing around with a bunch of apes. I mean... yes. And I also mean...wow! This thing hits on all levels like James Dean driving a car and hitting the breaks just before it drives off of of a cliff.  That’s it. I’m done."
1142,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.43,"Most recent batch - sampled from a 750mL bottle at room temperature. Thanks Mike for sharing.  Pours a thick black body, opaque with little head or retention. Aromas are big bourbon, fudge, cocoa, vanilla. Taste follows the nose with a ton of fudgy goodness with vanilla, milk chocolate, and roastyness on the finish. Not getting a ton of spices which is my only gripe. Great body, rich and thick with low carbonation."
1143,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.53,"A - Pours a deep dark brown with a thin a tan head. S - Aroma is brown sugar, toasted coconut, vanilla, dark fruits and bourbon. T - The taste is heavy bourbon, vanilla, ripe dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, oak and finishing with some lingering toasted coconut.  M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finsih. O - This is a pret stellar beer. The coconut is subtle and really enhances the base beer."
1144,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.24,"Look (4.0): opaque yellow, not much of a head. some bubbles"
1145,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.41,"I found Susan on tap at Armsby Abbey on a recent trip to Massachusetts - a bit of a detour, but well worth the drive (for food and beer both). Susan is a tremendous warm day beer - I had no A/C in my car and was quite hot. Susan is tropical, with some pineapple and malt and hoppy bitter fruitiness. It's damned fine and refreshing - I wish that Hill Farmstead distributed or tapped in the Midwest."
1146,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.67,"Pours a nice peach amber color. Aroma is tart, funky and stone fruit. Flavor is fantastic. Nice tartness with stone fruit sweet and sour on the finish. Has a nice body and overall a delicious beer."
1147,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.46,"for how hyped up this particular one is, it is nowhere near my favorite beer from de garde so far, and frankly nowhere near the objective best, if thats not nitpicking at this point (all of them being so fantastic). i love the story of this, but from the bottle, it didnt blow me away to the extent that some of their others have, especially some of the fruited ones. its really sour, more acidic than i remember most of them being, and that slows down drinkability a bit for sure, even with the amazing carbonation, soft round mouthfeel, and relative dryness to finish, its still just a slow sipper for me, which is probably how lambic should be anyway, but its sour enough to be harsh in the belly, and thats over the line for my preferences. perhaps this is a product of it being in the bottle too long, being a lambic type i was in no rush to open it, but not all of these age favorably apparently. the yeast profile under the acid is fantastic, musty bretty and funky, with distinct juicy fruitiness to it, white wine, apricots, even ripe pears, its rustic and interesting, but with the acid its pretty aggressive. the oak is sturdy here too, grounding and dense all the way through which i really like, it seems sort of oddly hoppy, like they definitely didnt use hops aged down to zero alpha acid, and if they did, there are some weird organic compounds in the mix here somehow. its got like a fruity linger in the finish i dont normally associate with the style. despite the developed brett and heavy wood, this doesnt seem as mature to me as i would have expected for something modeled on gueuze with the different vintages in the blend, less of the iodine medicinal character than the old world ones bring, and less of the hayloft agricultural harvest rustic character, this is almost too refined to fit that bill, not a criticism just a commentary. i think id like it more if the sourness were less, and dont get me wrong i still love it, but i would take a great many of their other beers before i took this one in a hypothetical draft of their best beers. always a treat to have their stuff though, and i can safely cross off this bucket list brew for now... edit: this was leagues better the second time around for me, less acidity, a lot more nuance to the wild yeast profile, and with a fresh hoppy character to it at the end, tons of white wine, elderflower, and even white peach, its goegeous, and was a standout from a heavy session of amazing beers. not sure why it didnt taste like this the first time around, but i hve a raise a few scores to reflect how good it was this time. huge thanks to my buddy for sharing his bottle!"
1148,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.21,Bottle courtesy of yllib. 
1149,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.69,"Appearance is a hazy pale orange like a fresh squeezed orange juice. Aroma is definitely grapefruit, pineapple, and mango as well as fresh squeezed orange juice. Taste like a delicious fresh squeezed juice with hints of pine as well. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy and juice-like from the lack of filtration. Superb beer."
1150,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.45,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head. Smell is a lovely balance of coconut and roasted malt/coffee notes, with just a hint of cinnamon and earthy spice. Taste is an exceptional balance of sweet, lightly toasted coconut and caramel malt as well as roastes malt and coffee notes, with hints of dark chocolate, cinnamon, earthy spice and just a hint of licorice and vanilla coming through as well. Finishes with a very light bitterness and some sweet coconut and roasted coffee notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation. Certainly the best coconut Porter I've had due to the exceptional balance. The coconut is not too overbearing and balanced very nicely by the roasted notes and a good bitterness, as well as some light earthy/spicy notes from the coffe, giving this a perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness. Also has a great, full and rich body and mouthfeel for the style and ABV."
1151,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.48,"Wow, baby, talk to me. Hey, baby, want me... This beer 100% is the hot girl at the club, gym, and goat Yoga. Everyone wants her. Deep, luscious, bold Stout essences with heavy, yet smooth chocolate that make a playa want to scream for dayyyzzzzzz."
1152,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.5,Golden yellow color. This is straight juice. Pineapples and oranges. Mango and papaya. Some sourness and tartness. Light bodied. Acidic. Lemony. Amazing beer! So troipical.
1153,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.67,"Pours golden. There's a musty grape aroma, some tropical hops as well. The aroma is incredible and it carries through into the flavor and feel. There's good wine barrel presence, but it's balanced by the Hill mixed culture and the dry hop. There is funkified tropical fruit and some grassiness on the finish. It's amazingly complex, super balanced, with no component overpowering the rest. BA Dorothy is a phenomenally delicate beer."
1154,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.4,"Striking gold isn't easy. Once you find it once, you gotta keep going back time after time. And that's what Central Waters Brewing does with their bourbon barrel aged American Double Stout. Except, its black gold. And the beer of that exact namesake pours with the consistency of used motor oil, black and inky upon the pour, a patient froth begins to release. The draw of caramelized char, coffee, chocolate, nuttiness and wonderfully burnt cream is too much for the nose to resist. In similar form the initial taste is lush with molasses, brown sugar and cream in suggestive of roasted marshmallows. As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a strong sense of coffee, cocoa and roasted walnut overcomes the sweetness and begins to usher in the bourbon complexities with charred oak, vanilla, coconut, cherry and caramelized whisky spice. Trending moderately bitter, the late palate highlights a walnut character with coffee-like bitterness although all are probably hop-derived. Full bodied and quite decadent overall, the rich and chewy ale never promotes cloying textures, but finishes long and fat with malt flavor and mouthfeel. An extended warmth of peppery whisky and a simmering bourbon heat resonates slightly past the char and the beer's nearly port-like fruitiness."
1155,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.87,"From the DC brewery. Their first run of DDH Mylar Bags 4pk of 16oz cans. Two beers consumed 3/17/21. Canned on 3/10/21. 16oz English pint glass. As with any OH beers I review, I am fortunate that I am reviewing all of their beers from 3 days to 1 week after canning. In short, this is one of the best Hazy IPAs I have ever tried. Great job DC for living up to one of the most famous OH beers from Brooklyn. A - Cloudy, very hazy. Straw-goldish overall hue skewing towards peach and apricot in color. Two-finger head upon pouring quickly reduces to thin head that clings to glass all the way down. Lace is comprised of tight bubbles. S - Smell is 4.25 when first poured from refrigerator. Gets better after warming up a tad. Tropical fruit, orange oil and a hint of spiciness on nose. Pleasing, but not an indication of the flavor explosion to come. T - Boom! Let this warm just a tad after removing from refrigerator. Tropical fruits, very much mango forward, hit you in the kisser right away. Almost overpowering, if the flavors weren't encased in a smooth, velvet glove. After the initial mango surge, flavors transition into cantaloupe, watermelon rind and pink grapefruit oil....especially pink grapefruit pith. The oily and slightly bitter grapefruit pith are both flavors and textural....and linger in the mouth for over a minute after swallowing. Under all of this is a subtle mint note that glides under the more noticeable flavors, as well as just enough hop bitterness to create tension to the fruit flavors......and this quality elevates this beer over the total fruit bowl experience of DDH Broccoli IMO. F - Creamy and velvety smooth up front and quite oily (expressed fruit rind) on the finish, but never heavy. Dangerously crushable at 8.50% abv. O - My favorite OH beer I have yet to try (up to 28). OH makes a lot of very high quality beer, but this one in particular is both contemplative, very crushable and refreshing at the same time. All at 8.5% abv. I am no beer expert and my palate is not as blessed as many, but after well over 1,000 beers over 30 years of drinking craft beer, this is among the 25 or so best beers I have yet to try. A world class beer and something anyone should buy as soon as they see it. Get it fresh!"
1156,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.41,"Sweet and slightly malty, tropical hoppy, and hint of orange-tangerine nose on this one! Taste follows with a juicy-soft, slightly malty, slightly earthy and dry finish...as it warms, the earthy-dry vibes start to come out more. This is very soft on the palate...great mouthfeel! Fantastic!"
1157,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,3.79,Split 3-ways thanks Sam!
1158,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.57,"This one pours a mostly clear golden sunshine yellow, with a small head, and a very small amount of lacing. This smells like chalky, minerally funk, with lots of citrus- mostly lemon lime and white pepper. This tastes pretty good, but it's surprisingly mellow. It's a slow sipper, complex, and doesn't bash you over the head with a farmhouse anvil. I get sour lime, white wine, minerally funk, sweaty Brett, and grapefruit. There's much less of a hop presence here than the normal Dorothy, which is not surprising. This is surprisingly creamy and soft, with a huge level of drinkability. Hill Farmstead really cannot go wrong for me. This is exquisite."
1159,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.87,"Canned 9/23/21. One day old. This is as fresh as it gets. Pours out an opaque orange yellow with a finger and a half of creamy white foam. A picture perfect looking IPA. Nose is huge swaths of citrus right out of the gate. Orange and tangerine. Digging a little deeper I get some mango. There's a mild sweetness that persists throughout. Like a hint of vanilla pound cake. This smells fantastic.  Taste is something else. Orange juice and mango and the slightest touch of grassiness that builds after some time. The key here is the smoothness of this brew. Usually upon tasting an IPA, there's a sharp edge of bitterness that pokes around the outside. With this, there is absolutely none. Its so well rounded. It's like a stone that sat at the bottom of a rushing river for ages. This gets a 5 because of that. That sweet and mild vanilla note that appears on the nose, shows up in the taste and imitates an orange Creamsicle or orange sherbert. Mouthfeel is that classic Tree House medium bodied, soft, pillowy quality. Highly drinkable. This just glides across the palate.  Overall, this is probably the best IPA I've ever had. There's an effortlessness that exudes from this brew. Almost like it was picked from a tree at peak ripeness. This is a masterclass. The crown jewel in Tree House's collection."
1160,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.4,A solid double west coast IPA that is smoother than most. I get the hype behind this beer but I don't find it as enticing as other double IPA's. Not my favorite from Russian River Brewing but definitely a powerful beer.
1161,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.27,L: pours clear brown without a head but is thin and black in the glass
1162,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.7,"Bottled 7/22/19. Poured at 55 degrees. Dark brown rocky foam briefly sits atop black liquid; no cap retention; barely a thin ring; no lace; medium legs on swirl. Strong spicy green chillies, rum and chocolate; hot boozy exhale. Taste follows nose and add vanilla, oak and mild roast coffee in the middle; rum soaked chocolate Mexican cake finish. Silky feel, medium body, moderate minus carbonation; warming from 15% ABV. Overall super well balanced, lots of heat from the peppers and alcohol with plenty of chocolate and vanilla to round out the whole; and the nose/flavors stay strong from first sip to last. Worthy of the premium price paid."
1163,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.72,"A 375ml bottle at Himmergiet of the 2015 Vintage. Poured into a mini wine glass. Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy ruby red dark purple colour with a one finger pinkish purple head that had good retention and sparse lacing. Aroma: Blueberry, tart, funk, some acidity and lemon. Taste: Blueberry, sour, tart and light funk. Mouthfeel: Light bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Overall: Wow, this was just special. One of the best Cantillon offerings I’ve tried along with the Lou Pepe Framboise. It’s just too bad I missed the 2016 release in Copenhagen by two days as I would have loved to open another bottle."
1164,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.24,"Pours a light reddish brown body with slight pink hues, half finger white head with surprisingly good retention time, nice lacing. Smells of tart lactic acidity, blackberry puree. Mild grainy malt sweetness in the background, but make no mistake, the acidity and the blackberry are the stars here. Although, the blackberry is certainly playing second fiddle to the lacto and acetic acid. Flavour is surprisingly less sour than expected, e.g. La Fosse, and the blackberries kick in towards the end. For the most part, it's oak, a bit of hay, a lot of lactic and acetic acid contributing a strong sense of sourness. The blackberries start to come into their own halfway in, and leave you with a mild jammy flavour at the end. The tartness never recedes but is rather constant. Still, it's a tasty beer and is far easier to drink than La Fosse. Overall, a very nice blackberry wild, but it lacks a good bit of complexity for the most part. It's acidic with a moderate blackberry presence, that's pretty much all she wrote."
1165,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.57,"This beer has the beautiful yellow appearance of egg whites, which might be tacky if it weren't backed up by an excellent smell of citrus and peach and a delectable taste of tangerines and brown sugar. Trillium is on one with this masterpiece, which has a texture that feels thick, bites nicely, and finishes crisp. This is one of the best, and I'm very happy to be moving to Boston next year in large part of the guys at Trillium."
1166,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.29,"Blend #2---poured into a HF Tulip glass,.... has some typical dark sour notes, cherry, chocolate, fig, all blending together... a fair amount of sourness, not enamel eating but definitely up there.... has a unique and long finish that differentiates it from other dark sours ive had... hard to qualify, almost chlorine-like but in a good way (sounds odd I know).... Very nice but not a huge edge over other more accessible dark sours."
1167,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.65,I’ve had a majority of the highest rated/reviewed Prairie Stouts. Probably all of them in the top 250. This is easily the best one of the bunch. Everything is superb!
1168,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,5.0,"Amazing. This was my introduction into IPA's, and now I am hooked! I absolutely recommend this beer to everyone who is in Charlotte and loves good beer. All of Heist Brewery's brews are amazing though!! For sure one to check out!"
1169,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.54,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a side project long stem tulip. Thanks Ryan for sharing this.  Pours a hazy orange body with a two finger white head that reduces to leave a layer of white foam and little lacing.  Aromas of hay and grain, green apple and a little spices.  On the tongue is tart citrus, green apple, white wine and oak on the finish, dry finish"
1170,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.63,"Look: Hazy and fluffy, this is a joy to look at. Wonderful lacing that lasts.  Aroma: The aroma is pure fruit, mostly peach and citrus.  Taste: It starts as fruit juice and ends nice and bitter. Peach, orange, apricot.  Mouthfeel: Nice and thick, with low carbonation levels.  Overall, this is a reaaaaaly good beer. Many thanks to brentk56 for sending me this."
1171,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.75,"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. Look- Black, medium brown frothy head, slightly below average head retention, average lacing. Smell- Bourbon, coffee, toffee, oak, slightly coconut. Taste- Bourbon, coffee, toffee, slight coconut notes, semi sweet. Feel- Full body, sticky, syrup like, slightly below average carbonation."
1172,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,3.99,"Growler. Cloudy orange/yellow pour with a white head. Nice citrusy hop bouquet. The taste follows suit with a nice malty backbeat. Still, a pleasant bitterness from the hops. Flutters of honey in the background. Good body and mouthfeel."
1173,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.59,"No bottling date but I picked this up at the brewery way back on 6/13/19. It says not to age but I wasn’t in a rush to drink it with so many other beers in the fridge having shorter lifespans. Pours beautifully, as a beer this big should. Nose is quite boozy but everything is there. The flavor/feel is soooo creamy, so damn roasty/malty, the coffee is massive. I love it. Dark chocolate and espresso roast coffee dominate the entire experience. Slightly sweet, perfect bitterness, amazing drinkability for the statistics of this beer. World-class!"
1174,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.97,"LONG TIME WANT. Draft pour at vintage estates boardman ohio. L - deep and dark. S - holy fuck. Layers and layers of molasses, carmelized brown sugar, bourbon,vanilla, caramel. T - that's the best beer I've ever had. I can't even describe how good it is. It's like the first time I had bcbs how amazed I was at the depth of the flavors. Years and thousands of beers later this is blowing me away like bcbs did.  F - huge. O - perfect."
1175,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.66,Hazy beautiful beer. Unreal how thick hazy this looks. Had on draft in New Orleans which is an extra plus. Creamy mouthfeel which brings out the grapefruit taste. It costs your mouth. The taste is great but the smoothness is the best part of this. Well done.
1176,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.95,From Bottle to glass
1177,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.4,"2018 release. A: Pours a purplish-red with a cap of tight white head. Excellent retention. S: Bright raspberry, mild earthy funk, light cherry, and light dry barrel.  T: Lots of fresh raspberry, light oak, moderate tartness which is cut by a decent amount of fruity sweetness. Mild earthy funk rounds out the palate and adds some complexity.  M: Light body with medium high carbonation.  O: Tasty stuff, nice Brett character and toeing my limit of sourness without going over."
1178,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.34,"2016 batch, hard to tell what month due to a smudge on the date stamp. The honey is still a standout, lending a natural sweetness and floral aroma as a counterpoint to the base porter's roasted bitterness, and drying out the finish. The earthy, nutty coffee is less obvious on the nose but still shows up on the palate, alongside an obvious, but not dominating, bourbon and oak character from the barrel. Moderately full body with an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel."
1179,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.49,"Pours a dark black with a tan head. Smells of bourbon, toffee, caramel, and vanilla. Tastes of bourbon, oak wood, toffee, caramel, roasted malts, dark roasted coffee, cream, cocoa, and blackstrap molasses. Medium-heavy creamy body with medium-light carbonation. Overall a stellar RIS."
1180,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,Poured from a 12 oz bottle
1181,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.48,375mL bottle into a Teku
1182,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.74,"The beer comes in a hazy medium gold color. The aroma is green and earthy, with a surrounding tropical aroma. The flavor is a fruit orgasm of passionfruit, peach, guava, mango, tart orange and tangerine. Smoothie for days like Tree House. A bready malt comes in the middle as the beer ends with an earthy bitter herb finish and alcohol slowly drags it way down on the palate and esophagus. A beer to enjoy 4-6 oz. of as alcohol comes with palate fatigue on this big, but delectable, strong hoppy brew."
1183,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.13,"750ml Bottle at share. Clear, light rose colored, small bubbly head. aroma brings the usual funky brett tones, accented with raspberry and cherry. More fruity, jam-like flavors with a gentle tartness and sweetness."
1184,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.52,"2020 bottle poured to a teku glass. Thick and redolent in appearance, with moderate lacing left from a full finger of head. Smells a bit like a boozy s'mores, joined by vanilla and rye spice. More rye than any other rye stout I've ever had, very strong grain notes on the front palate, boozy heat shortly thereafter. The molasses lends some sweetness at first but then dries out the finish. Light notes of sorghum and dark chocolate. Very satisfying."
1185,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.6,"Pours a very hazy, approaching turbid, orange color with a dense, creamy white head that laces the glass beautifully. Truly looks like orange juice in my glass. The nose is rife with juicy, tropical citrus notes, with orange sherbet most prominent, along with pity grapefruit, and mango. The taste is led by the orange sherbet, which is truly delicious, and the grapefruit, mango, and especially the pineapple flavors work really well with a slightly sweet oat flavor to create a staggeringly crushable 8.4% ABV beer. The mouthfeel is full and slightly pillowy, as expected with a NEIPA. This beer lived up to its hype, IMHO, and more. A world class example of the style."
1186,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.28,"L -- The usual thick, inky black appearance for the TH pastry stouts. Two fingers of deep tan head produced with moderately aerated pour. Some retention and lacing"
1187,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.75,"2018 bottle - flavors still pretty sharp, with nice heat and plentiful barrel notes. Maple and coffee are subtle, but it all works together really nice."
1188,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.74,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours a nice dark pink/light red. Nose is mouth-puckering, sour, cherry, wheat, funk, leather. Taste is mouth puckering, dry, sour cherries, grass, funk, vanilla, and maybe a touch of raspberries. This is really amazing. Mouthfeel is dry with a lingering sourness on the palate."
1189,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.6,"I'm trying to do a quick review. Bottom says ""Dan's notoriously bad at date codes 4/1/21"". Purchased for $7 from a private collector because let's face it i can't get it here in ohio so i might as well get it from someone who can. i've heard a lot about this beer and i'm excited to try it. i pour it out and it's immediately got a 3 inch head, probably among the biggest heads i've ever seen. Color is a very hazy peach / mango. Smell is all citrus, all day long. Orange, lemon, mango, peach, any of those light colorful orange colored fruits is what we're smelling here. Taste follows the nose and is extremely light and refreshing. This is like drinking a cold glass of orange juice, but pure and a bit lighter. Mouthfeel is light, thin, and quite carbonated, with a dancing effervesence that tickles the palate. Residual taste after a swallow is orange and lemon peel. This is as good if not better than Resin, one of my favorite beers. I could drink this all day long. The ABV is a little under what my taste palate likes, I prefer the heavier beers, but I have to review this beer objectively and it's quite good. Overall a nice citrus taste from a beer that could make mowing the lawn seem like just a fun way to get to the end. Cheers!"
1190,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.51,"Poured into a snifter. Jet black in color and viscous. It produced a medium-sized tan head which hung around for a while. A fairly potent aroma of milk chocolate, German chocolate cake, and spices. The taste was spot on. Silky-smooth chocolatey flavor with the spices described above. Impressively, this was not too sweet and seemed to have just the right feel. This is an amazing beer."
1191,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.64,Top of the top in terms of IPAs. Was able to score two six packs at the brewery itself. The color on this IPA is almost unheard of. Also the taste is as fine as an IPA gets.
1192,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.19,"As is the trend with all the Rocheforts, this has a muddle turbid appearance, with a slightly darker prune juice hue of brick red to brown, under a moderate, less active tan head that's softly convex, settling to a densely blanket that retains well. Aroma is more subtle and restrained, but also mildly hoppy, while taste follows suit in that it is far more drinkable than 8, despite its slightly stronger ABV. I'm getting notes of sticky toffee pudding with fig and mincemeat via a moderately light but silky body whose carbonation is tingly and fine but expandingly airy, before coming to a semi-dry finish that has a slight prick of numbing heat. A second visit brings a touch of molasses and ginger snaps with hints of caramelized brown sugar, yet it remains slightly bitter by a lightly charred sort of element. This is a far more balanced brew with a more deft hand and clearly--aside from its strength, which was probably a big deal in its day--this balance is what has kept its reputation so high."
1193,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.06,"2013 bottle. That was EXTREME, could feel the smell from the bottle and the off flavors here were kind of unpleasant in the first 15-20 minutes. The funk was so strong we couldnt have the first sip, and i'm not talking about horsey aromas but some kind of fishey/rotten food/mold and more. After waiting for the beer to get warmer the aromas morphed into something more fruity and the framboise finally came up. Very very sour on the palate, mid carbonation. What an experience this was, scary and amazing!"
1194,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.79,Drank straight from the can. Nice dankness with some good citrus notes. I think I might prefer this to Heady Topper. Definitely one of the legendary NEIPA's!
1195,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.63,"This hits all the right notes. Super thick stout. Sweet, but not crazy sweet. Toppling Goliath has done it again. This is nearly perfect in all aspects. I wish this was widely available."
1196,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.5,"I’ve sought this for awhile, really excited to finally try it. Gorgeous orange color with a light tan head, this is not hazy at all. Dank citrus notes dominate the nose, and there’s also a healthy pine note. The taste has a nice boozy note up front. I don’t normally appreciate booze, but this works magnificently with the dank citrus notes and pine notes.  There’s a reason this is a world-class beer. Truly phenomenal, and well worth the wait."
1197,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.0,"Thanks to james for trading that magnum BART to score all these Cigar City beers and Hunahpu variants. Will return the favor.  Pours black. Brown head, cola in appearance, 1/2"" deep. Retention ain't too shabby. The aroma is a hot stinging dose of alcohol first, then roasted malt, chile pepper, wet oak, cinammon. There is a lot going on in the nose, I seriously think I sniffed it 4 times in the first 60 seconds because each time it revealed more about the beer. Thankfully we cracked this one a little more leaning to the room temperature side of things.  The taste like the aroma came through as hot on the first sip. There was also a substantial amount of bitterness, this thing seemed to be clocking in around the 90 ibu range, tons of roasted barley in here and I guess a decent degree of hopping to get it into that range. There isn't the smoothness of a vanilla factor here, and the cacao nibs similarly get swallowed up by more domineering parts of this beer. Previous iterations seemed to have more pepper heat, but I dunno, there's heat here in multiple ways, the alcohol first, then the pepper, each contributing to the overall burn and bitterness.  Plenty of viscosity in the mouthfeel, CCB makes some thick ass stouts. Its real good, but definitely a beer you need to share, it just isn't something I can dome solo, even though I absolutely enjoy it in small quantities."
1198,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,3.83,"Bottle shared by tlay10. Into a tulip. 2007.  Looks like you might expect, but thinner.  A little oxidized. A lot of the honey, sherry qualities brought on by age. Beneath: assloads of butterscotch, toasted oak, dark chocolate. A little licorice.  Smoother flavor. Big tangy chocolate notes, some sherry, honey. The swallow brings a blend of bourbon, roast and cocoa that's impossible to separate. So. Smooth. Medium-light, a little thinner than expected. Light tingles of carbonation. Past its prime for sure. Still went down far too easily."
1199,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.43,"Pours deep black as expected. Nose is malty and cinnamon. A lot of cinnamon taste with dark chocolate notes. Some alcohol on the finish. I don't notice much from the peppers in aroma or taste. The beer has a great mouthfeel, really nice. Overall I was glad to finally get a chance to try this. It is a good beer, but with some many great stouts available at lower price points I don't know that I'd revisit this."
1200,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.86,"From 750 mL bottle to snifter A: Jet-black and viscous as hell. Pours like crude oil - no chance of a head under this kind of weight. S: All the notes of a good barrel-aged stout, just ramped-up...a lot. Wafts of alcohol volatiles push the boozy aromas right to the center of olfactory organs, allowing one to parse every scent. Charred oak, vanilla, cocoa, ripe cherries. Notes of coffee and anise in bitter aspects of the bouquet, caramel and freshly milled whole grain in the sweet. Obviously plenty of booze, smells like a liqueur. M: If this was any more viscous there'd have to be a molecular phase-change to a solid. Bring a knife and fork just in case. T: The first thing noticed at the front of the sip, besides the booze, is that it's not THAT boozy. Not 21%-boozy. I would have pegged this 14-16%, and the restrained alcohol renders the brew a lot more drinkable than it could have been. Also, the high gravity doesn't overtake that buttery, bourbon-y, caramel-y aspect that makes barrel-aged stouts so delicious. A perfect balance of sweet and booze throughout the sip, closing with a long finish. Really long.  Just a phenomenal beer. One of the best brews I've had. I was skeptical when I read this was their big Hoarder's special last year; what was disclosed about the process led to a risky end-product - a lot of ways this could've gone off the rails. But this is easily the best beer The Bruery has brewed (edit: compared to bottles available to Society members - I'm not able to frequent the tasting room that often, so there may have been a one-off gem I missed). Just wow."
1201,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.99,"Dark black with a pretty thin tan head. Smell is pure vanilla and coconut. Taste is out of this world, one of the best things I've ever tasted, period. Coconut up front, smoothing out into pure chocolate flavor that really does taste like German chocolate cake. The only knock I'll give it is that the barrel doesn't come through a ton in the flavor, but it's hard to call that a negative when it tastes this good. Pretty sweet, but not painfully so. Smooth feel, maybe I'd like it a little bit thicker, but again - this is just quibbling and it's hard to really knock this at all. Fantastic."
1202,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.39,"Review #500: Side Project - Fuzzy  Batch 4 (2020) 375ml - poured into a tulip at 42°F. Pours a moderately foggy sunglow orange, not dissimilar to the peach on the label. A thin, coarse, broken off-white head almost forms, before quickly falling, leaving only a razor-thin collar, and constant streams of effervescence. 4.25 Nose: Signature Side Project pale base, with evident crackery grains, a touch of malt, and some dusty silo. The peaches are restrained - apparent, but not loud, lending a very organic white peach aroma, much like nectarine. The acidity translates as fresh lemon juice, and just a splash of apple cider vinegar - tame, and bright. There is a ton of wet white oak - woody and musty, playing with some funky wet hay, raw honey, stone cellar, dusty attic, leather, parchment, honeysuckle, lilac, dried leaves, and peach blossoms. Not aggressive funky or tart. Palate: Fuzzy greets the palate with a quick flash of tartness - lactic and acetic in nature, lending some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. The peaches, once more, are very natural and ripe, but not jammy. These are fruity, bright white peaches, with most of their fructose fermented out. Huge stone fruit notes of peach, nectarine, apricot, and a big plum presence. Remarkably floral, with honeysuckle, lilac, gardenia, and even a hint of honeydew melon. As the acidity curves, oak begins to show, along with a hint of sweet grain, which adds nice balance. Some farmhouse notes of hay, wet wet, stone, and earth emerge, providing that true wild touch, with the brett adding a nice dusty, sweaty, overripe element. It finishes remarkably clean, with a general stone fruit presence behind a fading acidity, some subtle grain, and drying wet white oak, with nothing really lingering. Mouthfeel/Body: It's incredible how Side Project can produce these 8% ABV wild ales with such clean, crisp, snappy fluidity. Fuzzy is light-bodied, with no real malt weight, and quite dry, with no significant residual sugars. Perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne, but with a similar feel - airy, clean, bright, and snappy. Acidity is tart - sour, even, but definitely shy of puckering. The finish has some nice drying tannic oak. Ultra-clean. Overall: Fuzzy is a bottle with a lofty reputation. Long considered one of the finest fruited wild ales. That's a tall order. Is it the greatest wild ale I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. Is it the greatest peach sour I've ever had? Most likely. What it most certainly is, is the definition of Side Project. Yes, it is one of the more sour offerings, using their high acid blonde base, but it isn't overbearing, and it's one of the more subtle offerings - beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that they're so great at. The tartness, the minerality, the organic nature of the fruit, the oak, the gentle funk, all meticulously blended. It really is a world-class wild ale, and one everyone should try at some point."
1203,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.63,"2019 vintage. Silver wax. This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like dark chocolate fudge, oak spice, nuttiness, caramel, tobacco, smoke, and vanilla. I'm not sure this is worth the exorbitant secondary price that it commands, but it's certainly a very well executed barrel aged stout. The barrel character is very well done, and it's a surprisingly dry and non ""pastry"" take. There's tobacco, roast, oak spice, caramel and well integrated bourbon, along with vanilla, deep dark chocolate fudge, some fruitiness, brownies, and espresso. This is medium bodied, and not very boozy, with a good drinkability for what this is. I could imagine this wouldn't be that hard to solo dome, if you really wanted to do that. I have no frame of reference to say if this stands up to the earlier and more ""legendary"" batches of this beer, but I have to say that I really enjoyed it."
1204,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.59,"2018 release. Received from @woemad in a BIF box. Poured into a pub glass. It pours a dark walnut with cola hues at the bottom of the glass. The creamy, medium mocha-colored head faded slowly leaving a thin film of lacing inside the glass. It's highly aromatic with roasted malt, oatmeal, bourbon, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel, nuts, cocoa, tobacco, and earthy char. The taste opens with notes of both fresh and burnt coffee, oats, bakers chocolate, burnt nuts, leather, and char. As the glass breathes and warms, I'm noticing more caramel sweetness and just a hint of black cherry on the tip of the tongue. The bourbon is clearly evident but it doesn't overpower the other flavors, which are nicely balanced and nuanced. Despite the burnt notes there is surprisingly little bitterness at the finish. This Stout has a thick, creamy mouth feel with low/moderate carbonation. There is no escaping the 13.6% ABV, which is more than just warming. Sip this one slowly. Savor it because it is one of the best Oatmeal Stouts you'll encounter. Thanks, @woemad for the chance to drink this exquisite Stout."
1205,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.9,"2020 on draft at Toppling Goliath. It pours pitch black with minimal/almost-none foam around the ring of the glass. Aroma has loads of maple with coffee. Like maple syrup covered pancake stack. They are definitely present in flavor, maybe more maple than coffee, along with chocolate and a bit of roast. All laying on top of that bourbon sweet base. The most impressive thing is the feel here. It has that soft, warm feel. There's no hint of booze. Yet it's also somehow thick and the flavors hang around for a while. It's really one of the best mouthfeel beers I've had, for imperial stout.  Are there beers that have perhaps better flavor or aroma? Yeah, I think so. But the feel is at the very top. Great beer."
1206,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.8,"2019 vintage poured from fridge temp. Motor oil black with gorgeous brown head. Nose is maple, bourbon, milk chocolate, vanilla, and big roasted malts. So complex and aromatic. Taste is mind blowing. Big black licorice, maple, bourbon, vanilla cream, dark chocolate, marshmallow, and dark fruit. Mouthfeel is huge and creamy."
1207,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.72,"A-deep dark mahogany, no head to speak of"
1208,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.5,"From tap to tulip, brown-black pour with a cream head that fades fast. Aroma and taste of toffee, raisin, molasses, maybe licorice or anise, malt, caramel. Alcohol is conspicuous, isn't masked by the other flavors in the same way as other beers in this style. Low carbonation, almost a root-beer texture. Overall really nice beer to end my weekend, I was very happy to find this on draft locally."
1209,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.0,This was malty for my tastes and for most HF hoppy beers. Felt more like a west cost IPA with the malt and pine characteristics. One of my least favorite HF hoppy beers.
1210,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.23,A little bit of a booze bomb so make sure you aren’t going anywhere if you have it. Nothing special about this one and was pretty standard when it comes to BA stuff.
1211,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.46,On tap at the brewery. Opaque dark chocolate color with a thin tan head. A nice barrel aroma along with some chocolate and coffee. The taste was as expected. Bright coffee up front followed by a hefty chocolate presence all wrapped in a bourbon blanket. Full bodied with a slick feel. Outstanding.
1212,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.43,"Sweet, burnt black figs, Fruity, mid palate sticky finish. Velvetly smooth. Roasty. Chocolate. Hint of black licorice. Very little bitterness. Very nicely done."
1213,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.55,"a near perfect example of an english barleywine, this one aged two years in bourbon barrels and also bottle conditioned. its the saisons and wild beers that get all the attention from these guys, but this is as good as anything else in the game in this style, and seems gentler, more subtle, and more mature and drinkable than other over the top, barrel heavy offerings with lots of residual sugar, firestone walker comes to mind there, this is just a wonderful cold weather sipper, and honestly the essence of the style as far as i am concerned, big thanks to my buddy for sharing this one (among many others), in an epic session over the weekend, i have been wanting to try this forever. this has a deep matte mahogany color to it, a tall tan head creamy and thick, and no visible sediment at all, looks well cleaned up and mature. the aroma is rich barley malt, some sweet long boiled and toffee character to it, chestnut, maple, and toasted bread. its immediately not that sweet, full of earthiness, and enormously layered. the bourbon has some vanilla and honey notes going on, but doesnt interfere with the base beer, it enhances, sweet oak in the mix as well, raisin, and fig. the flavor is amazing, really about the barley malt, very enlgish to me, no hops at all, maybe some maris otter in here with some darker crystal, definitely a concentrated richness to it without decadent sweetness weighing it down, and the booziness is minimal for the style, although this is a bit lower anyway, i like it not being a focal point in the taste. the bourbon and oak are smooth and not too forward, and there is a wonderful depth and body to this, better and better as it warms too. the perfect balance of all the elements here, some yeast character through most of it, and a curiously clean finish for the style. near perfection here, no frills barleywine as it should be. a wonderful drinking experience!"
1214,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.41,"L: Straw w/ a little bit of burnt amber in hanging around S: Grapefruit, pineapple and a little bit wet fire wood T: Orange / Grapefruit pith. Assertive bitterness but not overpowering F: Chewy up front but finish really dry; my favorite part of this beer. O: A beautiful beer with layers of complexity. With that, and call me crazy, I prefer Nelson Pale"
1215,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.49,"Drinks like a stout. Dark roast flavors, and a really nice vanilla and bourbon added from the barrel. Complex as a porter can be. Don't expect a huge BA stout, it is a porter after all, but if you want a well made example of an imperial with stout like characteristics, this is the one."
1216,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.79,"Look- Nice orange color, my guess would be it was a nectarine sour just from looking at it poured in a glass. Smell- This was the best part, the nose on this is perfect, super funk nectarine, almost smells like its going to sweet when you taste it. Taste- Sour nectarine with that classic de garde funk Feel- Super funky lasts from beginning to end, pretty bubbly."
1217,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.7,"2014 vintage at the brewery. Pours a deep red, with fine foam. Smell has a crazy amount of raspberries, complimented by a little bit of funk and some elderflower. Taste is moderately sour, but sooo refreshing and fruity. Raspberries, some lime and a bit of hay are the main notes, and it's so deep and complex. The flavors just keep evolving as it warms. Awesome stuff! Mouthfeel is thin and prickly. Overall, an amazing fruit lambic, so complex and enjoyable."
1218,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.4,"Tried 2015 in 2017. A heavy one for sure. Hazelnuts are my favorite, but I barely picked them out. Nevertheless it was a tasty brew which I may have enjoyed more than its boozy Black Tuesday cousin."
1219,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.18,"This seems like a natural extension of the original Ten Fidy. It totally can handle the extra attention, and it deserves it. The thing has about as brown a head as you will see. The smell is nice and boozy - alcohol and whisky. The taste goes where you expect, to the malty, roast, hoppy, bourbon booze place. It works. You can tell it's huge - nothing is hidden. No need to drink any whisky if you have a couple of these (be careful). Recommended. It is pretty pricey, but a nice treat for a deserving drinker."
1220,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.12,"Hazy gold-amber with a large, airy white foam leaving a layer of chunky lace and settling quickly to a bubbly matt and round collar. Smell certainly showcases brett, which is slightly funky of nutty cheese, but in a nice, measured and balanced way, allowing room for spicy oak and nice, fresh peach and green apple brightness. Taste is very peachy--as though it is candied, or like a bright and juicy, freshly made pie filling before being cooked--with pear, spice from the oak and slightly funk cheese. Lightly sour and balanced, this has a nice froth, medium body, and a semi-dry, crisp finish."
1221,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.02,"A lot of fresh raspberries, small amount of tart cherries keeps the tartness to manageable levels. A classic blend of lambics and fruit from one of the world's most revered brewers. A must-have!"
1222,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,"More orange than golden pour, creamy bright white head, and the smell! Pop the top and it's like someone in the room just sliced a grapefruit. We know we're dealing with a single hop beer, and the taste, while consistent and one note, still takes you on a journey. The Citra comes through loud and clear, and then at a point in the midtaste, that taste kind of ramps up to a new level. And let's not forget that long, luxurious aftertaste. Brilliantly crafted."
1223,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.52,"Tall can, fresh from the source...3/7/19.. Great look here, all hazed up, classic NEIPA/TH. A load of fine bubble lacing all over the glass. Delicate orange/tangerine sniff. Light, fluffy, orange juice laden, super flavorful, over the top delicious....world class...go get some"
1224,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.22,2015 vintage. 
1225,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,"Appearance - The beer poured dark color with a creamy mocha head topping off the pour.  Smell - Spicy cinnamon was very forward in the nose. Despite the high ABV, booze was not evident in the nose. Some roasty chocolate notes were also present.  Taste - As best I can describe it, the beer was liquid cinnamon Christmas trees. The cinnamon was so well balanced with the spice. It seems some brewers add cinnamon to extreme limits, and consequently destroying the beer. This was so well balanced. The peppercorn added a unique dimension that allowed for a pleasant burn at the end.  Mouthfeel - The beer was silky smooth with light carbonation and a slick sweetness. The spice was allowed to linger. Overall - This is a great beer. Seek it."
1226,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.62,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a very pleasant maple and bourbon. Taste is a nice slightly sweet blend of maple and bourbon.
1227,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.51,"Poured from the bottle into a Bruery tulip glass. Vintage 2018. Dark oily chestnut brown out of the bottle, filling with a deep mahogany brown body color. Snapping tan head, making two fingers but dissolves very quickly off the pour, with virtually no collar. Exquisite aroma. Even while opening and pouring the beer just bursts alive. Thick rich nougat smelling, with hints of earthy walnuts/hazelnut smelling quality. Deep dark cocoa and rich almost coffee scented chocolate bar quality. Wine port like aromas particularly with woody barrel notes all over of oak, even a strange touch of soft cinnamon character without the burn. Big, impressive, controlled, not ovepowering but just giant and salivating. Woah. Palate tuns things a bit down to earth. Large aromatic flavors are taken over a bit, mostly through a very port and wine like body and flavor, but still a great one. Soft dark cocoa, with large fruity booze qualities more like brandy than bourbon. Earthy touches slightly, but forgoes nuts in flavor in the mid palate for more berry and cocoa tastes. Nougat aftertaste, almost like a sticky almond but not a sweet, touches with the high booze but tolerable still. Mouthfeel while silky is just a touch fizzy lacking a lasting coating to make the flavors last and linger. Tends to flirt with fizz just a hair making for a bit of distraction. Neat take on a Black Tuesday variant, nearly magical, but the flaws are really nothing major to bring it down in enjoyment."
1228,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.1,"500 mL bottle. Black. Smells of coconut, brown sugar, and coffee. Tastes of coffee, coconut, sweet brown sugar, chocolate, and a little cinnamon. Bourbon. Heavy, sweet. Yikes. It's big yikes, but it's big yikes in a really tasty way. I can't drink a lot of this, though."
1229,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.81,This is a near-perfect beer. It has all the hops one could need but it's welcoming and balanced. It's a great beer that can be enjoyed year-round.  I can't think of many better beers that you can easily get. It's a little bit of a shame that it is 13 for a 6 pack (there are options that are close for 10 bucks).
1230,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.63,"Did not think anything could be better than Lunch. I was wrong Pours a beautiful light orange with white head. The Hops hit you as soon as you pour it. Lots of mango, and apricot. Goes down smooth with a little stickiness on the tongue."
1231,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.8,"Black to flat marble mahogany with a dense mocha fizz that settles quickly to a sparse film and medium collar, then nothing, leaving behind only clear legs when swirled. Smell blends charred oak and charred chilies to a point where they're indistinguishable from each other, and the chilies are near smoked chipotle levels. Smooth dark chocolate quickly mixes in, bringing plenty of cinnamon, a little vanilla nougat, almond, and a hint of strawberry. Taste is chocolate chip cinnamon raisin cookies with a touch of sweet chili, red fruit, sweet vanilla and brown sugar. A hint of toasted graham emerges as it warms, as well as some root beer, with a little agave in the finish, but there is not much barrel present whatsoever. This one's thin, fizzy, wet and slick."
1232,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.9,"Pours a clear, deep golden amber coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smell is dominated by quite rich, musty, blue cheese funk and tart and fruity yeast esters of green apple, pear and gooseberry, as well as some lemongrass, hay and musty oak. Taste is a superb balance of quite rich and nuanced musty, moldy, cheesy funk, expressive, tart, fruity and slightly spicy yeast esters of green apple, pear, apricot, white grape, gooseberry, lemongrass, clove and white pepper as well as a distinct earthy, musty oak presence and lighter notes of hay, white vinegar and sulphur. Finishes with a medium tartness and some rich funky and estery notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium/strong carbonation. What really stands out here is the rich, complex and quite nuanced funkiness that ranges from sweaty, musty notes to moldy blue cheese and mushrooms, being backed up and balanced by an assertive, but not overpowering lactic acidity and tart, estery fruit, with quite an array of fruity notes and lighter spicy accents as well as a not too heavy, but distinct earthy, musty oak presence, making for a quite a rich, complex, yet superbly balanced Geuze, with no aspect of the flavor profile feeling overpowering while still mainting a tremenduous depth of flavor. Without a doubt the best and most funky Geuze I've ever had, with a superb complexity and sublime balance."
1233,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.48,2014 Vintage
1234,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.25,Honestly pretty famn good. Looks generic blonde haze. Smells guav-y pineapple citron. Hinta toasty malt. Tastes pretty dry. Juciy but not too much sugar. Finishes a mango-y pine crisp. Hardly any malt. Feels nice. Small
1235,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.64,"Appearance- The beer poured a deep murky brown color with mocha bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.  Smell - The nose is that of magnificent sweet dark fruits with a hint of booze.  Taste - I detect prunes, nuts, caramel, raisins, and a slight vanilla presence with the wood coming through at the end. The overall profile is like that of a port.  Mouthfeel- Even with little carbonation, this still seems a bit thin.  Overall - I wanted this one forba long time. It was worth the wait."
1236,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.79,"Straw apricot colored with a tightly bubbled half inch head of beige foam that lingers long and leaves legs of lace up the sides of the glass. Inviting aroma of pine and tangerine. Bright fresh hop flavor, full of pine and grapefruit, orange pith and citrus. Smooth and even mouthfeel, tingly in the finish. Bitter grapefruit notes linger. An outstanding beer."
1237,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,3.81,"750ml bottle, 2016 vintage, poured into a The Bruery tulip glass. Enjoyed on 1.31.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a jet black color, very opaque and thick with a thin tan head that has no retention and yields no lace. The aroma is nice, huge charred barrel character with tons of chocolate, lightly roasted coffee, smooth oak, stone fruits with a lot of hot alcohol as it warms. The flavors are good, tons of chocolate, cold pressed coffee, mild acidity and light roast, vanilla bean with smooth and rich bourbon, super chewy oak, light char, lingering stone fruit and very intense alcohol. The mouthfeel is okay, coating, medium body, very active texture which is a bit surprising with a smooth but very warm finish. Verdict: A decent barrel aged stout from The Bruery but I think I prefer the regular Black Tuesday. The coffee here adds some acidity that just adds to the harshness of the alcohol. Again, with many of The Bruery beers, it's just too massive and too intense that it is tough to handle more than a few ounces."
1238,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.42,"Big, thick, and dark (there's a joke in there somewhere) are the only ways to describe this epic barleywine from Alpine! While overall I found it to be a touch too sweet, it's still a fantastic BA version of the style."
1239,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.66,"2016 vintage at Himmeriget in Copenhagen. Awesome looking beer, dark purple with lots of visible bubbles. As soon as you open the bottle, the smell of blueberries smacks you in the face. Pouring it and sniffing into the glass shows what a great lambic is all about. The blueberries mingle with sour, funky notes, with hints of raspberries. I could smell this for hours... Taste follows the nose, very pronounced blueberries with a bit of raspberry, and just the right acidity.  Mouthfeel is bubbly and lively, way too easy to drink! This is one of the best sours I've had, perfect balance, gorgeous too look at and the nose is amazing. Manages to live up to the ridiculous hype surrounding it."
1240,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.88,"Not to be cliche, but this monster hides the alcohol content extremely well. Super juicy, big pillowy body, and doesn’t carry the sharpness you get from a lot of triples. Finishes clean. Outstanding."
1241,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.68,"While I wasn't blown away by AFTW, this beer rocked my world! I love the flavor complexities, and enjoyed sipping on this for quite a while. I know it's on the top 250 but I never see anyone talking about it. And they should be."
1242,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.35,"Canned 11/15. A nice murky honey-tea color with a tall, tall poofy head of 3 fingers. Tons of gobs of lace left behind.  Such a refreshing nose. Should be made into a summer candle. Effervescence of pear, spritzer, honey, apple, melon, and lemon float up to the nose in an ocean wave-like wafting. Ever so slight dank at the tail end of the nose.  Flavor is juicy, although I can tell it has faded just a touch as there's some notes that I can sense the shadow of but not quite full-on. Nice pineapple, banana peel, oranges, bubble gum, starfruit, and mango all form together for a soft but easy profile.  Feel is creamy and soft all the way, and has a nice resiny touch at the finish.  Overall, I've had more than my fair share of Trillium beers and they possess a softness and supple quality that no other brewer has yet to accomplish. Such a treat. Love my Trilliums."
1243,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.68,"650ml bottle, of the 2016 release. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a with a dark black oily flourish, one finger thick white head, very good retention and film; bits of lacing. Smell and flavour are really loopy here. First off, the smell seems to be strawberry vanilla, with varying components of the two depending on when you're smelling it. Not sure what it is, sometimes it smells like strawberry milk (like a Yoohoo), other times it smells like vanilla and bourbon, and in the background is a varying amount of chocolate and cocoa. It's strange, but damn, it is wonderful and makes you want to keep going back for more. Flavour is similarly shifty; it's delicious but difficult to nail down one flavour at a time. Strawberry milk, vanilla bean, vanillin from the barrel, oak, a good bit of bourbon sweetness but not heat, dark chocolate and fudge from the bourbon. Wonderful and actually a very complex flavour to it. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy and luscious, appropriately carbonated, and it's really difficult to put this down. You really do find yourself wanting to drink more after each sip. A very damn tasty beer that somehow worked despite the high potential for the adjuncts to completely fail and make this undrinkable. This is a beer I could have drank all to myself over the course of a hour. While the strawberry was more of the Yoohoo! variety, I think that works better in a beer like this than the lighter natural strawberry flavours that one initially thinks of."
1244,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,5.0,"batch 2 - 10/15/16 - Enjoyed at Casey. Just thinking about this beer makes my mouth water. Had it side by side with The Cut: Peach and the look of the Leaner is hazier and looks more like a peach color than the much more bright yellow (and also delicious) Peach Cut. Upon smelling it you get the sense it's going to be intensely sour, and it is, but amazingly the peach flavor still shines through and it seems to be a perfect balance. As the Cut series is 5% ABV, I was shocked to realize after I had a few sips that the Leaner was 8%. The name is apropos, it tastes like the most sour, juicy peach you've ever had squeezed in a glass. Leaner is one of the best sours I've had. Psyched to have a couple bottles to save for a special occasion."
1245,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.64,"Poured from a can. Yellowish Ana very hazy with a foamy white head and lacing. Smells of pine, grass, mango and citrus. Taste follows the smell and mouth feel is very juicy."
1246,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.18,Look - fantastic black with a great tan head and sticky lacing
1247,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,3.82,"Glugs of used motor oil black aggressively suppress any build up of head outside of a very thin golden chain. Viscously sticky yet contrastingly sour, strawberry-cherry balsamic vinegar pairs with a roasty yet chocolatey background. The barrel brings a smoothing, luscious Madagascar vanilla bean character, especially on the nose, and particularly over time as it warms, but the sharply tart cherry and balsamic vinegaryness can be painfully distracting at times. With a little more deftness of hand favoring more nuanced subtly, this could have been a knockout stunner. All in all it's a bit too ostentatious for me. Oops! This was full review #5000 for me. Another milestone blissfully ignored until after it passed."
1248,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.6,"A - Pours a midnight black with a thin tan head. Nice amount of soapy lacing. S - Aroma is espresso, dark chocolate and vanilla. T - The taste follows the aroma. Espresso, vanilla, milk and dark chocolate, caramel and lactose. M - Full body with low carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish. O - This is a fantastic beer. The flavors are amazing. Easily one of the best stouts I've ever had."
1249,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.02,"L: More dark brown than the expected blackness, and head is paltry thin with little retention. Some lacing. S: Rich bourbon and vanilla. Notes of dates and marshmallow, still a touch muted, less than rich, and underwhelming.  T: Again with figgy bourbon flavors and sweet malt, definite soy sauce and booze still a bit rough after aging this one 3.5 years! Cherry tartness. Drenched in syrupy sweetness. F: It’s a big beer so some heat is expected still and the carbonation is decent, but it is quite thinner than expected. O: Aged 3.5 years to be drinkable still starts hot when chilled, nice tartness but a bit boozy and sweet! So many better big stouts. Not up to this hype."
1250,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.15,"Canned 6/21/21/Poured on 7/2/21...Sweet, tropical hoppy, slightly malty, and sweet piney-dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a malty-sweet, and prominent piney-hoppy bitter finish...some mild nuttiness shows up on the backend as it warms. This is an old-school, tasty brew...and I am glad I finally got to try this!"
1251,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.06,"Subdued, red wine tart aromatics on this one. Taste follows with a red wine tart finish and swallow. This is pretty well-balanced and easy drinking. Good!"
1252,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.78,"Poured from fridge temp into snifter. Pours motor oil black with a little bit of light brown head. Nose is chocolate, licorice, coconut, bourbon, cherries, and more chocolate. Taste is insane. Coconut, bourbon, chocolate, molasses, toffee, licorice. Wow - just wow. I could drink this every day. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Overall, this is one of the best BA stouts I have had."
1253,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.54,"Opaque black body topped with a nice thick, creamy, light brown head. Milk chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, and a faint wisp of coffee comprise the smell. Coffee, cinnamon, and a bit of chili pepper kick, all wrapped up in a moderately sweet dark chocolate body greet the taste buds. Rich and heavy body; dense and velvety; sludgy; huge residual sugar presence; minor bit of chili pepper heat nicely offsets things. This is an incredibly rich and flavorful imperial stout. The taste really brings together all the adjuncts and in a nicely balanced and complex manner."
1254,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.73,Cask on tap at SP cellar 11/3 A- Jet black with rich coco looking head
1255,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.63,"Pours jet black with a small tan head. Intense roast bordering on Smokey. Chocolate. Definitely some bourbon heat along with vanilla infused oak. Quite dry. Heat of the alcohol overwhelms my palate making tough to judge IBUs. Full bodied, long lasting finish."
1256,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.66,"A smooth soft maple backbone with a splash of coconut, with coffee and vanilla to follow. Very drinkable, my only complaint is the maple over powers the bourbon barrel."
1257,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.59,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter. Looks black with a dark tan head that starts thick and falls to a collar of suds. Smell hits hard with cocoa up front, coffee, a bit of pepper but it's subdued to me. Taste has a lot of depth and character. Starts sweet with chocolate and cream. Middle brings in coffee, sweet raisin and almost a berry jam. It's a good balance of sweet and bitter.. Finish gives you the pepper heat with a cocoa aftertaste. Let it linger in your mouth and you get a bit of tobacco too. Feel is medium body with very little carbonation. Coats the tongue but doesn't linger. Overall, this is a fantastic drink. It is complex, interesting, and changes nicely as it warms. Every sip is inviting. Higher ABV is well hidden. Excellent beer lives up to its reputation."
1258,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,3.69,"A 500ml corked and caged bottle, 2017 Series, Batch No.02, bottled in October 2017. Poured into a snifter glass. Appearance: It poured black in colour with a thin brown head that dissipated almost immediately and left only sparse to no lacing. Aroma: Roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruits, prunes, raisins, molasses, oak, with touches of bourbon and vanilla. Taste: Sweet, boozy, bourbon, light roast, chocolate, coffee, molasses, dark fruit, plum, prunes, raisins. Mouthfeel: Full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall: Sweet and boozy, which is not a preferable combination for me as I find it too rich, and not easy to drink, even if just sipping. I preferred Stone Mikhail a lot more as I felt that was much more balanced."
1259,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,3.96,"Everything about this offering looked, felt, and smelt amazing, but was a little bitter for my liking.  I am sure some people will find it an amazing offering."
1260,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.85,"2017, into chalice. Pitch black, with no foam head upon pour or even any around edge of glass. Just a dark liquid. Extreme amount of barrel oakiness present. You can smell the complexity of this before even tasting it. The flavors have oak and barrel flavor that imparts chocolate, raisin and even vanilla. Feel is quite sticky and thick.  Among the very best straight up BA imperial stouts. It is in a class with Bourbon BA Dark Lord, Assassin and Black Magick batch 2 (Buffalo Trace). Worth trading for."
1261,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.54,"Poured into a goblet. A bright yellow golden hazy beer with a medium white head. Aromas of hay, straw, lemons, and oranges. A hint of funk as well. Tart on the palate and mouth watering. More delicious with each sip. Great lemon and orange citrus mixed with hay, earthy notes, and a gentle funk. Dry and clean Easy drinking. Outstanding."

1263,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,5.0,"Perfection. Saw this a week ago and the the thought stayed with me to check out. What better way then to try one on Dec 31st 2020 and one Jan 1st 2021. Very pleased. Smokey, deep, brown sugary & sticky tar-like in an oh so good way. Lip-smacking good & down home comforting. And the cool-chillness from being in a wonderful non-assuming dark colored alum can. Really this is simply perfect. Im not that good at being able to described all of the nuances in beer or whisky (though I GREATLY respect and appreciate those who do. It is an art to be able to...), but I know what I like and what I really like. I really like this. oh and most importantly it motivated me to drink it while listening to Astral Weeks album by Van the Man.  cheers and stay healthy in the new year.

1264,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.31,"Very rarely does Prairie have a miss, but this one is solid. Just the right amount of booze and coconut. The term 'paradise' is very fitting for this beer!"
1265,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.58,"Batch 2. Bottle dated 2019. 18% ABV. Drank out of a tulip over two nights in Feb, 2021. Nice vanilla. Relatively light mouthfeel. Total bourbon smell and taste. Loved it."
1266,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.4,"It's remarkable that this doesn't come off as boozy at all, given its high ABV! Lots of flavor, but a little too bright/bitter compared to some other Trilliums. Nothing wrong with it. Just some I like better."
1267,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.67,Very dark appearance with nice tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a nice bourbon maple. Taste is a slightly sweet bourbon and maple that is exceptionally smooth with a molasses touch

1270,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.71,"Pitch black pour, smaller tan head. Gobs of lace. Aroma of rich coffee, roasted malt, whiskey, fudge. Taste is nearly indescribable.... Fudge brownie, light bourbon, rich, freshly roasted and ground coffee, wood, light chestnut. Thick full body, oily mouthfeel, and not boozy in the least bit. Incredible!"
1271,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.5,2020 - Bourbon to the nose. Silky mouthfeel. Bourbon upfront with vanilla on the finish. Very well balanced. Very minimal bitterness or bourbon burn. Excellent.
1272,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.85,"Over the last year, I have had pours of the 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017 batches. This beer ages phenomenally, love the chocolate aromas and taste. Will continue to buy and drink this lovely beer."
1273,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.56,"Orange citrus with peaches, this is so easy to drink its no wonder it is in a 750ml bottle. Sante focuses on this funk that their beers offer that I have not tasted in many other breweries that are also known for their ales and saisons, and this was no slacker. A very mellow orange taste is felt at the start but soon the strong peach taste in this one that will blow your mind, the tartness you would expect is minimal if any as the peaches are sweet enough to make your tastebuds focus on that."

Coffee and chocolate. T.F: Just like it smells. Roasted grains, burned sugars, French roast coffee, and dark chocolate. Moderate bitterness... a bit of vanilla with more coffee coming through towards the finish. Medium bodied... oily on the tongue... with roast at the finish. O: A well executed coffee stout. Great flavor... solid bitterness... and a warming sipper. Glad I got to try this one."
1276,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.84,"Dark brown pour (@59 degrees) with ruby edges; tight tan head; fairly quick cap leaves a thin ring and a small island of mini bubbles; fizzy sudsy dots of lace and thin legs on swirl. Molasses, caramel malt, musty antique store furniture, vanilla and a whisper of bourbon (?). Semi sweet caramel malt on entry, followed by molasses and a firm hop bitterness; raisins and plums, toffee middle; roasted nuts, a touch of old shoe leather and vanilla/oak notes on the backend. Medium full body, semi sticky feel; lite carbonation; slightly warming; smooth, silky tongue coating; dry oaky barrel finish. Overall, love the bitter hops coexisting with sweet caramel; complex layers of dried fruit, molasses and earthy/musty notes as beer continued to open up; not boozy; simply world class!"
1277,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.08,"Black like cannon fodder and aroma of maple and caramel. A very pleasant beer but far from the $50 price tag. A fantastic beer that should be a flagship for the brewery and not a large event once a year release— specially since other special releases TG does are predominantly barrel aged. Good beer, overpriced"
1278,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.86,"3 days old Frothy and hazy. Sweet citrus, honey, resin - juicy. Taste is sweet with tons of light malt. Grapefruit and honey. Hardly any bitterness Legitimately one of the best IPAs I've had"

OCCASION: having just posted my father's obituary while three feet of snow fall, I feel the night deserves something aged a few years... GLASSWARE: Lindemans stemmed tulip... pours a viscous jet black body that rolls out a a number of upward-cascading rivulets of effervescence... its head continues the show, stabilized as a thick half-finger's worth of light tan, creamy foam approximating a latte's froth... rich vanilla, maple syrup, mellow bourbon sweetness, a hint of smoke, some alcoholic heat... then heavy coffee bean and roasted malts arrive, and the profile is quite a celebration.... the first sip is frothy at the start, turning to velvet-smooth satin past the tongue and a warm entrancing finish that fires well after... the teeth pulse--the hops are in here--and the mouth holds its presence... the alcohol draws in and around, but like the best, it isn't tasted, but rather, appreciated... rich is the word--each sip is a dessert in itself, a settling, centering mood boost that makes one appreciate.... a massive collision of syrup and coffee initially arrest with intensity, before the sweet bourbon, charcoal smokiness, chocolate, and lactic acids round the experience into a drink worth mulling over... I especially like how they ignored the bacon temptation--this works so well featuring the original KBS with a worthwhile variation... it's a compliment this urges me to finish and pour a dram of the Jack Daniels Barrel Select I bought a while back, thought that introduces banana--eh, another story for another time... speaking of stories: I had a bomber waiting to be consumed on my forty-second birthday while staying with my in-laws in between houses, and my son unwittingly smashed it while opening the refrigerator...the dog loved it, but we all cried a bit. Fortunately, CBS returned not long after, and maybe it's better I drink it in 12oz. offerings... well, this was worth waiting for, and though it could be straight shot if only for its ABV, its sweetness makes each sip require a caesura before its next one..."

It does mellow and open, but is still hard work. Not even close to Dark Wanderer or even some Firestone Walker stout blends.  Other than just the crazy ABV, I don’t see why this got the cult it did..."
1284,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.21,Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a deep brown color head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coffee with some bourbon notes and nice vanilla notes. Taste is a complex and rich mix of nice vanilla notes with bourbon and rich black chocolate notes and a sweet honey-laced finish. Body is full with deep oily texture and good carbonation with hints of warming alcohol notes. Very rich porter but a bit too much honey for my taste.
1285,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.0,"Served on tap in a tulip. Orangish amber in color, a solid finger of off white foam. Very nice pale ale. A bit on the hoppier side, with citrus notes - orange, mostly - just slightly over balanced on a nice malty backbone. Bright flavors. Very nice mouthfeel."

Taste follows but only subtly sweet...you're hit with the dark chocolate coffee notes with a hint of maple syrup. The dark chocolate notes get more prominent and bitter as time goes on and overpowers the maple for me. It has decent depth, just a smidgen thin for my palate."
1289,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.74,"Jet black pour, dark tan head. The base Dark Lord aromas plus heavy vanilla and some oak. Wow.  The vanilla is really forward on the taste, which enriches the flavors of the base beer. This is truly world class, IMHO."
1290,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.47,"Poured from a 375ml bottle into a stemless wine glass Look: Crystal clear straw gold with a thin bite head that dissipated quickly Smell: Very Brett and funk forward. Jay, green apple skins, pears, salinity, oak.  Taste: Light and clean. Green apple skins, pears, white pepper, barnyard funk, light sweet tart and oak.  Feel: Light and clean. Almost aqueous. Drinks so well. Light acidity. Sweet with and off dry finish.  Overall: Just beautiful. I wish the carbonation was up a bit but overall this is a beer that needs to be experienced. The sum is greater then its parts. A description doesn’t do it justice. Pick it up if you see it."
1291,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.4,"Tastes like orange juice mixed w/beer, not bad at all. Not sure about a perfect 100, but it’s good. Smells a little musty. Mine was canned on 11/26/19 so its about 3 weeks old already. Not bad, but the perfect 100 it is not. The bissell brothers swish is much better."
1292,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.5,"Tasted on tap at Ansari's Eagan, MN during Black Friday tap takeover. I tried this beer first and it was by far my favorite of the 4 sampled that afternoon. Thick, smooth and tasty.

1294,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,5.0,"Pours black. Smells of rum and a little chocolate and dark fruit. The rum BA turns black tuesday into a carribean experience and adds notes of brown sugar, maybe toffee. Time has done this one well. Have one more I wont open for a couple more years to see how well it develops."
1295,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.59,"Appearance - The beer was a deep murky brown color.  Smell - The nose was light chocolate, but there was also a coffee presence.  Taste - This is a sweet one. At the front, I notice sweet coffee first. Then, sweet bourbon accompanies raisins, figs, and burnt malts. Surprisingly, the beer was not to warm. Not overly cloying, the sweetness continues in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - The sweetness lends itself to a sticky sensation. It is not as thick as the other days.  Overall - This might be my favorite day, notwithstanding Chocolate Rain."
1296,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.1,2016 version poured into a snifter. There is a nice booziness in the aroma however it is more subdued in taste. I enjoy the mouthfeel a great deal. I was anticipating this being a little sweeter with less char and bitterness in the finish.
1297,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.79,"This one pours a light pink-ish red, fully clear, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing. This smells absolutely incredible- jammy and seedy raspberry, both sour and just slightly sweet, with tannic red wine, oak, and a musty funk that's just delightful. There's a lot to unpack with this beer. It's probably the best beer I've ever had from Allagash- and that's saying quite a lot, as they make awesome beer. The raspberry flavor is bold and beautiful, but miraculously doesn't dominate, as the base beer is slightly prickly, with a warm musty barnyard funk- earthy but inviting. There's some nice oak and red wine flavors as well. This is just so well rounded. This is light bodied, and really crisp and clean, with a good level of carbonation for the style. This is absolutely a home run, and one of the best fruited sours in the country."
1298,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.66,"Bottle shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks Brad! The beer is hazy yellow with a small white collar.

1300,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.75,Cloudy dark straw appearance with a white head that is very appealing to th eye. Aroma is a very pleasant citrus. Taste is also a very pleasant and smooth citrus. One of the best APAs I have had.
1301,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.66,"Shared from a bottle with a friend on June 6, 2021. The pour is mahogany brown with reddish hues under a boisterous, fluffy light tan head. Lovely malt forward aroma sensations with Belgian spices and Belgian candied sugar. The body was medium or better and smooth. The taste is a luscious malt forward sweetness with Belgian candied sugars and the slightest clove and coriander character. Just delightful."
1302,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.4,"On draft at Boneyard tasting room. Light golden in appearance. Taste was malty with a citrusy component. It was very good for as high ABV as it was, but honestly I don't get the hype."
1303,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.5,February 5th: Side by side tasking with regular 2018 Abraxas. Low carbonation. A little barrel and pepper heat. Decent thickness. For me this is better than non BA but only marginally.
1304,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.53,"Dark pour with a tan head that leaves a ring around the glass as you drink it. Roasted malts and coffee on the nose with some bourbon barrel. Honey sweetness blends nicely with coffee, oak, dark fruits, dark chocolate, and bourbon. My lips were sticky after the first sip. A nice, thick body on this beer. Overall, a very tasty beer."
1305,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.8,"It is absolutely mind-blowing how thick this beer is - it's surprising that a Russian imperial stout bears absolutely not trace of hop or bitterness... it's smooth, thick, and rich, with loads of chocolate and coconut. I'd love to drink this every day, but it's so much sensory overload that it blows up your palate. Also, diabetes. Incredible beer - absolutely world class. The only coconut beer that I've had that is even on a level is barrel aged Coco Vibes. This one is the beer to beat."
1306,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.22,"Bottle @ Perennial. Hazy golden pour with a tall white head. Super fresh, juicy peach nose. Hints of lemon juice and green apple. Some light oak and white wine as well. The peach flavor is great, but the lactic sourness is just too aggressive to be a supremely crushable beer. A nice juicy fruit sort of tropical character and some nice grass and damp wood funk."
1307,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.07,"32 oz. growler. Slightly hazy. Small white head. Thin collar. Smell is bright citrus. Boozy. Fruity and a little bit of apple. Taste is bright citrus. Pine. Astringent maltiness. Maris otter is distinct. Boozy. Low carbonation. Medium body. Very tasty, but very big."
1308,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.27,"Picked up a 16 oz mason jar draft from the Craft Beer Hop Stop 11-7-20 for $12.00. This is the 2020 version weighing in at 13.0 ABV. Beer poured black with a nice brown head with the original pour. Nose is major bourbon barrel, very bourbon forward with a light touch of coffee and vanilla. Taste is hot bourbon over a large but lighter malt base with a touch of coffee and vanilla. Hopping along with the barrel and coffee balance out the malt sweetness nicely. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth. Overall this is a really good base beer that is pretty hot so if that is your thing try to get this on tap! For my tastes if this was bottled i would sit on it for about 6 months or so to let the flavors blend."
1309,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.68,"Goodness! Finally got my hands on this bad boy. So smooth, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, slight amount of coconut. The body is right on point for a big stout"
1310,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.6,"Pours a crazy dark opaque black with a thick, well, purple head. The nose is incredibly intense with bourbon and dark fruits. This beer is not messing around. The taste is a complete punch to the face. Waves of intense chocolate, followed by bourbon, followed by coffee. Woody notes and hints of vanilla throughout. Whoa."
1311,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.0,"Purple Bowling Ball, so 2016. Consumed on 2/9/2018. Jet black beer in a glass, tiny head. Straight brown sugar on the nose. Almost a milky type sweetness (you will need to try to understand).  Easily the sweetest beer that I have ever consumed.... Tons of sugary sweetness, coconut only adds to it. First thing you get is bitterness. You can taste and also feel the alcohol on the back end.  Sticky sticky spider web sugary mouthfeel. A sugary bomb of a brew.  This beer is not for the faint of the heart.  "
1312,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.56,"07/2017 - dig the coconut, chocolate, lactose, vanilla aromas, flavors; incredible mouthfeel, per usual from AC; a bit sweet, but hey, it's quite yum!"

1314,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.91,Vintage 11-14-16.
1315,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.39,"Batch 4. Bottled 1/18. A: Pours a pale golden, somewhat hazy, with two fingers of white foamy head. Very good retention and some dots and streaks of lacing. Champagne-like effervescence.  S: Musty and dusty (in a good way) like a wine cellar, moderate amount of earthy funk, and light apple and graininess. A very appealing and elegant expression of Brett. T: Upfront, light apple, tartness, sweet graininess, and earthy barnyard upfront; followed by light earthy funk, apple, and some sweet maltiness. Almost no sourness. M: Medium body, medium and fizzy carbonation.  O: Amazing, Bretty nose. The taste is a bit subdued but still enjoyable."
1316,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.61,"Late 2019 release Pours onyx with a mocha head that leaves minimal lacing. Nose is of strong bourbon, oak, vanilla tobacco/leather, fudge. Taste vanilla,dark chocolate, smooth bourbon and oak. Feel is milk like thickness, and coats the mouth like wax, minimal carb. Overall, excellent complexity for being non adjunct, very drinkable and balanced with a great mouthfeel."
1317,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.5,Pours black. Brown head. Aroma is a combination of vanilla bean and Chile pepper coffee. Taste is the same. Silky smooth. Rum barrels round everything out. Overall delicious with that spicy punch.
1318,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.88,"Bought a bottle of 2008 in September 2011 at Akkurat in Stockholm, Sweden.  A: Not as dark as I expected. Dark brown but thick, almost viscous. This looks like it will be a real mouthful. Smell: Can't smell any of the alcohol.. Recovering from a cold but I know I can't smell alcohol but my senses are slightly muted. I get hints of chocolate, perhaps vanilla?  T: Excellent.. Even though I'm sick, this beer is drinking fantastic. I brought a KBS and the KBS in taste cannot stand up to the complexity of this beer. Mouthfeel: Feels exactly like it looks. A real heavy swisher. Overall: Love to drink this more but the price is pretty high. Still, quite amazing. Absolutely a delight to drink."
1319,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.21,"2019 vintage. Released a week or two ago.  A: Pours jet black with a cap of medium brown, espresso-like head. Recedes quickly to a razor-thin ring. Average retention and a few streaks and dots of lacing. S: Loads of toasted coconut, an undertone of vanilla extract, nuts, a bit of dark chocolate and roast. The coconut dominates the aroma almost to the exclusion of anything else. T: Again, just loads of toasted coconut with a bit of dark chocolate bar, vanilla, and light roast through the finish. Extremely sweet, though the sweetness works well enough with the flavors (even if it’s a bit much). M: Full bodied, super velvety, with light carbonation. Touch of alcohol heat. Pretty exceptional body to this.  O: Solid coconut-forward pastry stout, though extreme sweetness makes drinking more than ~4oz difficult. A little age might soften the overwhelming coconut aspect."
1320,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.17,"[Original rating 2015-01-01] Sours are not my favorite style, and I’m certainly no expert on them but this one is pretty damn good. Smells like a chardonnay and the first sip tastes like it too, but then you get the sour with the wine. Nice fine carbonation, good mouth feel."
1321,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.39,"Been trying to get this for years...just happened to be driving by the brewery and checked, and they had it! BAM! Love the label, but wish I could remove it easily Canned 8/09/19"
1322,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.14,"12 oz bottle from 4 pack, no date that I can see, but I know this flies out the door quick. "
1323,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.96,"This is a glorious example of why Hill Farmstead is probably the best brewery in the world. Complex layer upon layer of flavors, smells and mouthfeel that was simply amazing. I aged this for a year in my cellar and just spectacular....even better than when I had it last year."
1324,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.14,"I thought superior to base. Bold coffee taste dominates the bourbon barrelling character. Carbonation here beyond four years. Glad I went for this, glad I shared it."
1325,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.48,"This beer is one which truly lives up to the hype. At times beers like this gain a cult-like following without having the commensurate quality, but here that is far from the case. The taste exudes the balanced fruits, and the mouthfeel is thicker than the beer itself, but not too thick where it becomes overwhelming or chewy. It is still thin and refreshing. I have had this on draft, in bottles (19 and 20 releases) and have loved every sip of it. It is well-blended and balanced, and a refreshing and enjoyable combination of tartness and fruitiness. I love this beer!!"
1326,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.05,"I had a draft of this at the brewery in Portland, ME. I have to admit, I wasn't impressed. It tasted mildly soapy to me. The IPA present notes of pine and citrus and some mango were there for me but I just couldn't get rid of the soapy note and it felt unbalanced to me. The colour and smell were fine ... the mouthfeel was indistinguishable to just about any other IPA I've had but there was just nothing overly special about this beer. I'd rate it way below Sip of Sunshine or Very Green by Treehouse. Its clear this has some of the same notes as a Treehouse IPA but overall it just doesn't feel as balanced. It's like hearing a HS Symphony band vs. The Boston Pops. I'd rate this slightly under a King Sue or Greater Good. Overall, I just wasn't a fan. As they say in the Bronx, it's just 'A'iiiight'."
1327,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.73,2017 Vintage This is up there with some of the best BW's that I have tried. Incredible barrel notes. Sweet and rich flavors like caramel and toffee with a hint of dark fruits. Smoothest 17% abv beer that I have ever drank. It seriously drinks like its 10% how the hell did they do that? World class brew that carries its weight on the rating it receives. 2020 vintage ; drank 7/4/2020 stronger barrel when this is fresh. lots of dark fruit flavors and barrel. waxed can is unique
1328,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.75,It’s really difficult to get better than this when it comes to Russian imperial stouts. You can see why this is listed as such a respected brew. One I would get again for sure.
1329,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.43,A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high dark tan head that left a narrow collar of tan bubbles around the edge of the glass.
1330,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.75,2017 Bottle
1331,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.28,"This was exciting to a try, and I definitely recommend doing so if you have the opportunity, I feel like I wasn't necessarily mind blown as I've had a few NE style IPA's now but this was definitely really solid."
1332,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.74,"Poured from a 375mL bottle into a HF bulb. Batch 2. Thanks Ryan for sharing this.  Pours a pinkish-purple hazy body with a one finger frothy head. Doesn't leave much lacing or retention. Aromas are out of this world, nearly a 5 in this category - straight fresh plums and stone fruit, candied plum, tart lactic, light funk.  On the tongue, the plums don't pop as much but they're definitely present. Typical Hill Farmstead funk, citrus, but not too acidic. Subtly tart and very balanced, this might be least sour Flora variant I've had. Mouthfeel is nice and easy drinking, light and refreshing.  Overall an outstanding beer, and my favorite of the fruited floras."
1333,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.25,Pours dark black with quickly dissipating head.
1334,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.75,"Drank from a 16 oz can - not sure of the date but significantly fresh. Great hoppy smell with equally pleasant hoppy taste. For my palate, one of the best beers out there - prefer this over Heady. Seek this one out - it won't disappoint."
1335,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.77,"Can't help but notice the beautiful color of this brew first. A bright red, almost pink hue w excellent carb bubbles dancing the drunken dance they do. I love atrial, and it's natural to compare the 2 brews, but this can go toe to toe with it most certainly! Be prepared for that tart doe, loved how it felt."
1336,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,3.72,"2016 bottle poured into a snifter glass.  Extremely Peaty, earthy, Smokey, boozy, chocolate liquor, applewood, smoked malt, peaty, caramel, bittersweet chocolate, syrupy, very sweet, dark fruits. No carbonation, medium-heavy body. An interesting, unique beer. Not sure I was a huge fan of the flavor profile, mainly due to the overly peaty / earthy flavors."
1337,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.5,"Unknown vintage; drank 10/16/20 @ Charlotte's.  This was fruity but not too sweet; tart, but not punishing. A great fruit lambic from my favorite Belgian brewery. Can't wait to have another!"
1338,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.44,"16oz can, served in a Tree House snifter glass. Pours a dark opaque black body, one finger mocha head, good retention, a bit of lacing. Smell is milk chocolate, thick roast, sweet maple. It's sweet. Not much coffee behind it, but it has a bit of dusky chocolate, like baking chocolate or something similar to that. It's fairly fudgy but not roasty or bitter. Flavour brongs up front maple, milk chocolate, a bit of roast, and more chocolate. It's smooth up front, but has a bit more baker's chocolate, a mild earthy bitterness on the backend. It's very tasty and melds well with the added adjuncts. Full bodied, smooth, creamy and even a bit nutty on the backend. An overall excellent adjunct stout. There is just enough maple and chocolate to satisfy my mildly sweet tooth without being cloying or overwhelmingly sugary. It's delicious and almost ice-cream like."
1339,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.75,"Pours a bright orange color, about the same color as the can with a medium bodied white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of oranges mainly. Tastes similar with big orange flavors, some tart grapefruit, and a hint of melon. Tart and juicy finish. Velvety medium bodied mouthfeel, perfect amount of carbonation finishing pretty clean. Overall an excellent beer, possibly one of my favorites from Treehouse."
1340,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.99,"Batch 1 that Ive been holding onto for a while. First thing I noticed was the strong vanilla aroma. Very strong, in a very good way. Has a fudgy,vanilla, taste w a strong after taste of toasted coconut. And has ABV hidden well. Overall right on par w bourbon paradise. Prairie might be making the best stouts right now .. Alongside w Toppling Goliath. Damn do I wish I could get this often."
1341,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,5.0,"This is one of the sickest IPAs out there! As if Elder is not good enough, this one takes an even cleaner, smoother approach than the mentioned one. Absolutely delicious!"
1342,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.0,"A decent brew that is way over hyped and way over rated. Don't get me wroing, it's good, it's just not THAT good. There is a lot going on in this beer, some pleasant, some not. Worth the try!"
1343,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.26,"Bought a 4 pack fromt the brewery. Had to say, this beer underwhelmed me a little bit based on the ratings. Its still a good beer, but had a strange blend of sweet and bitter combo that just felt a little like a fight going on in the beer."
1344,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.4,"This is from a 2015 edition of the 12-year Elijah Craig... Ink black body; relatively thin yet dense and creamy light tan head. Light aroma of whiskey; faint traces of cocoa and roasted malt. Rich, malty flavor dense with milk chocolate, oak, and bourbon; vanilla. Heavy body; dense and oily; chewy and sweet tempered with a nice whiskey warmth. I believe the aroma may have suffered some with five years of age, but the taste and mouthfeel really shine on this beer. The boozy character adds a nice balancing quality to the thick, rich sweetness of this imperial stout. I'm sure the honey greatly adds to the feel and taste. I must admit that this has been around for a few years, but at nearly $35.00 a pop, I wasn't too keen on taking a stab at this. In this case, I probably should have sucked it up and gone for it. Chances are I'll be checking out some of their other versions, plus there are some newer versions of the Eclipse stouts that are now calling my name. Oh, the humanity..."
1345,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.5,"L: Dark dark black - no head to speak of S: Vanilla, milk chocolate and bourbon T: Cocoa, Fudge, vanilla, oak, touch of booze F: Similar to the BOMB in it's mouthfeel O: Pretty comparable to the base BOMB, but I at least enjoy the smell of this one more."
1346,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.24,Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter at home. Not sure what year this bottle is since they are not marked. Not the thickest stout around. Solid non adjunct stout with some booze kick to it. Not too sweet.
1347,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.8,"A 750ml bottle at Moeder Lambic Fontainas. There were two conflicting bottling dates. The original label has a bottled on date of 28th April 2010 whereas Moeder Lambic added a 2015 bottling label. Whatever research I could muster up shows that there does appear to be a 2015 bottling on 30th January 2015 out there (first since 2011). Poured into a 3 Fonteinen gueuze glass. Appearance: It poured a cloudy dark ruby red colour with a big three finger light pink head that dissipated fairly quickly, leaving very sparse lacing. Aroma: Very nice fruity cherry and strawberry with a hint of vanilla. Taste: Sour, tart, cherry and strawberry with some very light funk. Mouthfeel: Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall: Very nice and refreshing with great aromas. Unfortunately I have not tried the regular Oude Kriek though, so I cannot compare to that yet."
1348,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.42,"On tap at Brewskival 2018. Pours a luminous cherry red color, with very little head. Smell is tart, with notes of cherries, passionfruit, lime and pomegranate. Lots of levels here. Taste is tart with perfect level of acidity, and notes of apples, cherries, sloe, blood orange and a slight sweetness that I think is dragonfruit. Long, dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium, bubbly and creamy. Overall, an outstanding Berliner with so much flavor. Great stuff!"
1349,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.94,"Poured from a can. Failed to capture the date but I believe from a fall/early winter release. As always, a delicious beer... although this particular can was a bit murky relative to its peers. Still, appearance didn't impact taste... floral, citrus fruits, not juicy. One of my favorite beers."
1350,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.55,"Sweet, slightly malty, hint of orange/tangerine citrus, and sweet, piney-dank pineapple nose on this one! Ha! Taste follows with a malty-sweet, orange citrus bitterness that's subtle...then a piney dank vibe takes over the bitter bite. The bitterness on the swallow is a creeper...very subdued and then it lingers and quietly increases until you notice it on the back of the throat. This is an easy drinker and is soft on the palate. This is really good!"
1351,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.27,"Pours black with small tan head. Slight bourbon notes on the nose. Good thick stout with slight barrel sweetness and very smooth finish. Was expecting a little more given the ratings, but still a good beer overall."
1352,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.55,"Appearance is very dark brown with a loosely formed tan head. Head has moderate retention, but minimal lacing. Aroma is dark roasted malt, raisins, and a hint of anise. Taste adds molasses, coffee, and vanilla to the mix. It’s still quite hot, but should mellow with age. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous."
1353,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.56,"12 oz can pours black with a tan 2 finger head which sticks around for a while and leaves some nice lacing. Nose is a symphony of vanilla, bourbon, fig, raisins, caramel and sweet roasted dark coffee. Mouth is silky and smooth with more of the same. Bourbon,caramel, fig and sweetness are most prevalent. Finishes with a nice bourbon warmth. Let this warm up a while. The flavors really come out."
1354,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.25,"Pours a hazy beige color with notes of orange. A big thumb length head retains well and yields rings of lacing. The aroma displays several indicators of mosaic hops. Notes of berries, citrus, bubblegum, mango and peach. On the herbal end, there are aromas of grass and pine, subtle and significantly pungent like some of their other offerings. Sweet and juicy with a medium bodied, frothy and smooth mouthfeel. The fruity flavors mostly align with the aromas, except that flavors come into play as well. A malt backbone that includes wheat and oats contribute to the creamy texture complimented by the gentle carbonation. Mild notes of pine and grass add a gentle spice. The finish is dry with flavors of spiced bubblegum. Not as intense as some of the other Society and Solitude offerings. Just smooth and flavorful easy drinking"
1355,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.6,"Pours a dark brown body with a light brown head with low retention. Spiced bouquet with nutmeg notes, raisin and prune from the yeast, some toasted caramel appear too. Mild sweetness with caramel notes on the first plane, spiced notes also appear on the taste as nutmeg and raisin, prune and banana raisin. Low bitterness to balance the mild sweetness of the beer Medium to high body with high carbonation, sweet finish with lingering spiced mouthfeel. It is a great Dark Strong Ale with caramel profile and spiced notes on the smell and taste, Not as strong in alcohol or overall flavours, it is and great beer for cold days or night, complex but never overwhelming."
1356,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.19,2019-12-17
1357,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.4,"Big thanks to VaTechPhilly for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a J. Wakefield OG Club teku glass. I did not make note of canning nor consumption dates, but did note that the can was about three weeks old at the time of review. Batch is from early 2018. A: Turbid gold with orangish highlights, with a half-finger of white had that has decent retention. Low visible carbonation, but is almost opaque. S: Tropical fruits for days, orange-forward citrus juice with a touch of ruby red grapefruit. Pineapple and mango and some melon. Some dank and herbal hops as well. Light cracker malts. This is really juicy, but more melon pulls through here than some other NE IPAs – not a ding against it, but maybe not my preference. Nice. T: Taste follows the nose pretty closely. Juicy tropical fruits, melon, and citrus. Mango, pineapple, and perfectly ripe tangerine. Milder dank earthiness, a mild citrus pith bitterness, and then more juicy citrus and melon. A light cracker malt body underneath, but the hops are obviously the star of the show. Maybe a touch of fullness and soft breadiness from the oats, but it’s not pronounced. Mildly bitter in the hang with an orange juice-like fruitiness. M: A medium body but this does have a creamy mouthfeel from the oats. This is accentuated by the relatively low carbonation sensation, but it fits this beer quite nicely. Alcohol presence restrained. O: Really tasty. I think this is my second Other Half beer, but the first that I’ve had a full pour of - and it was really enjoyable. Maybe a little more melon than would be a perfect hop profile for me personally. But very tasty."
1358,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.88,"I'm probably being a little generous here with the rating but this is hands down the best beer I've ever tried. Found it in the back of total wine in the keg cooler, walked through the plastic curtains with the sensor lights flicking on to be greeted by this gem. ""Limit 2/customer"" a sign read, being the only beer brand back there it felt like I stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore, and with 100pt rating I just had to try it. im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100% and made me realize beers CAN be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits. I mean I made an account and am here now because of it right?  Served chilled in a frosted pint glass. Brick red-orange colored, Head Came less than 1/4 inch up when i poured. First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other ""specialty beers"" and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable. (Not a pro in the slightest and this is my 1st review, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I just had to put in my 2 cents because this is truly amazing.)"
1359,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.75,"Batch #4 release - drank on 6/29/2019. Just a bit funky with that characteristic Hill Farmstead barnyard tasting note. Sour, lots of dry hopping, but still pleasantly juicy. Quite good. Thanks to jhavs!"
1360,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.5,Was lucky enough to finally track down a bottle of Matt and enjoy it with a friend. Strong caramel flavors in this Old Ale. Very tasty but absolutely a sipper as this was strong and boozy. Solid but wouldn't probably track it down again.
1361,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.45,"one of the beers i have been after for a long time has finally become a reality, definitely one i have been keen on, so cool to have beery friends out there! this is unique in that its not just a peach wild ale, but one aged in cognac barrels, really complex and good. its got a high shine and a pale color, bright but less than fully clear through most of the bottle, some little bubbles coming up, but somewhat unremarkable visually. it smells a bit more sour than a lot of the de garde beers have been in my experience so far, really piquant, slight vinegar character, white wine acidity, clean though, less funky, and i get the cognac immediately, some sweetness and some alcohol warmth to it, with the very natural peach its almost a baked dessert complexion, light vanilla and graham and even tobacco to it, nice complexity but very sour it seems. the peach is crazy juicy and real and ripe, very authentic here, and i knew it would be based on the other fruit beers ive had in the past from these guys, man i wish i had a reliable supply of their stuff! the flavor here is excellent, again more sour than expected, but its a clean and lightly citrusy sourness, it seems built to balance the sweetness of the peach and even highlight its essence, the peach is bold from beginning to end here. the wood is strong, but the beer itself is quite light, minimal on the grain side, the peach really leads the way. the cognac though is an amazing tough, and im not sure this would be anywhere near as exciting without it, despite the obvious quality. its nutty and deeper than the oak alone, a golden raisin hint maybe, a sweet alcoholic layer, even cigar or something in the mix, just crazy, its amazing with the peach. i get a little less of the de garde funk that i like so much, more generic acidity, so i would enjoy more funkiness, but i cant complain. this was awesome overall, different awesome than expected, but great and really distinct with this combination of fruit and barrel. i hate to admit i had a little sinus thing going on and may have not experienced this in its full glory as a result, cant control those things and certainly wasnt going to pass on it, so i will look forward to hopefully having this again. i love this brewery, its always a joy to drink their beers. this appears worthy of its hype!"

1363,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.29,"Big like Hulk when he borrowed Barry Bond’s “vitamin supplements.” Huge, I’m talking huge coffee flavor like a hungover Sunday at Starbucks. But this beer wasn’t brewed with Starbucks; this is quality hipster coffee just like the dork that lives below you who rides a fixie to work. That being said, the only thing that Raul isn’t feeling is the sweet maple syrup (cause your boi ain’t into sweetness). Also, I wish the mouthfeel in the end was a lil more viscous. It’s not bad. It’s not Martha Hunt super model skinny, but I’d prefer if it was Ashley Graham large.  Yep!"
1364,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,3.98,"2015 bottle. Pours motor oil thick. The thickest, blackest beer I've ever seen. Very sweet. Cola, vanilla, oak and bourbon. Dry. Super sweet. This is borderline too much. As it warms, it's getting a bit better. Yikes."

1367,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.59,"Excellent Sour from Oregon. Tons of peaches add nuance, some funk, but not overbearing sourness. Considering how high of an ABV this beer is, the booze is masked to perfection with a smooth finish asking for another sip. I have had it at a Chicago bar (Links Taproom) and also picked up a bottle at the Beer Temple."
1368,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.35,"about a 3 week old bottle drank on 6/6/2017 I've been seeking this one out for a while and I can certainly see why this was in a league of its own when it was first released. The piney, dank, citrus combo is really nice, it's incredibly drinkable, and somehow there's very little bitterness while the ABV is quite high. I really enjoyed this one as this showcased the west coast style very nicely."
1369,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.6,"Brief Review: O: I was very surprised to see this was almost a Top 100 beer after last year's release. Missed out on that one, but was able to grab one this year. I'm maybe just a touch let down by this. It comes across a little boozy and hot on the nose and flavor. The coconut doesn't really pop for me either. Mouthfeel is just okay after what looks like a pretty slick pour. It's a touch messy and could be reigned in a bit. For a beer ranked this high, I don't think those are unfair criticisms. Is it still a good beer? Yes. It's rich, complex, and super bourbon forward (if you like that). But I have a feeling that previous iterations were maybe a bit more solid. Recommendation: Maybe better a couple years ago? But this is still a world-class beer any BA-lover should try."

1372,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,5.0,"This is my new favorite beer, hands down. It came out of a growler and poured sticky and motor oil thick - jet black with a tiny bit of dark brown head. Smells super boozy and brandy heavy. The taste doesn't have any of this heat. Starts out with the chocolate up front with a twinge of brandy, fades into the vanilla and BIGGER chocolate, then wave 3 and 4 come up from the back - HUGE apple brandy followed by just a tiny bit of spicy pepper. as it gets towards room temperature the cinnamon/cayenne comes out, as does the apple note in the brandy. Thick as hell with just enough carbonation.  Thanks Josh/jbuddle for this trade. ISO: Apple Brandy Huna FT: EVERYTHING"
1373,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.25,"""Best consumed by 7/13/17""; drank 7/16/17 (I did my best).  Opaque orange appearance.  A rough pour yielded a HUGE white head; frothy lace.  Fruit punch, mild caramel & faint dry grass notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Fruit punch & caramel flavors up front; dry grass & faint booze heat notes on the finish.  A bit more caramel forward than I prefer, but this was a balanced, flavor-forward IPA."
1374,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.68,"batch 12 (we think) drank on 4/2/2017 side by side Westly Look - moderate head that disappeared fairly quick, fairly thick body, light orange / dark yellow color. Sexy Smell / Taste- a lot of oak and interesting fruitiness to go with the apricot burst. That interesting fruitiness I not know is the pinor noir barrels because I thought this was just oak barrels. That definitely explains the complexity that really puts this beer on another level. Feel - perfect level of tartness while the flavors just soak into my mouth and linger so nicely. Overall - amazing beer. Glad I have a couple more."
1375,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.42,"So. Damned. Creamy. The dextrose bumps up the body but doesn't make it syrupy. The appearance is pretty much perfect; bright auburn, perfect carbonation, sticky lacing. Pine resin and grapefruit dominate the taste and aroma. Maybe some tangelo and sweeter citrus. Though far from my favorite HF hoppy beer, it's ne of the best triple IPAs I've had. My heart still belongs to Notorious though."
1376,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.57,"Appearance: Arrives the usual cloudy honey color with a modest cap; spots of foam cling Smell: Papaya, mango, melon, passionfruit and tangerine; pithy, bright and juicy aromatics  Taste: The pith assaults the tastebuds right away, letting you know this isn’t the usual NE IPA juice bomb; still, there is the progression of tropical flavors with papaya, mango and passionfruit forward -land just a hint of melon underneath; the mid-palate is all tangerine and the finish has a moderately high degree of bitterness  Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate to high carbonation; slightly creamy  Overall: Glad to be in the Boston area during the week after the can release; sorry to miss the cans but glad to taste this impressive beer on tap"
1377,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.56,"375ml bottle sealed with silver pressure cap. poured into Side Project ""sour flute"". Appearance: opaque orange body with tall white head composed of fine tiny packed bubbles. Bone white head that wisps away fairly quickly, but a thin cap of head remains on the beer during the entire drink. Leaves a bit of lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: The nose is bursting with juicy nectarines. This is also oaky, some earthy brett, and light SP funk; but the nose predominantly consists of juicy and authentic fruit. This really does not smell like it is going to be very sour.  Taste: This is way more sour than the nose would lead you to believe; 7.5 out of 10. Lemon / citrus acidity is huge on the front end of this beer. Light funk, dry oak, and a hint of stone fruit. The fruit does not have the juicy quality that is present in the nose and does not have the intensity as the aroma possesses. The lemony / citrus funk lingers during the entire drink and even on into the finish. Sourness is more intense than the fruit for sure.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Bright, citrusy, and dry. A pucker factor big enough that it requires sipping on this beer. Carbonation has a creamy feel to it despite the dry effect that this beer imparts.  Overall: This sour is hitting on all cylinders. A visually appealing sour. The nose is the best part of this beer because there is so much authentic fruit aroma. A very flavorful sour with an outstanding mouthfeel. I think that the sourness overpowers the fruit a lot in the flavor of the beer and I could use a little bit more nectarine flavor. Not much else need to be improved on here it is just an outstanding fruited american wild ale."
1378,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.41,"2017.  Pours a deep black with a tiny caramel colored head, no lacing present.  Lots of sugary sweet maple syrup on the nose. Hints of the barrel (oak and bourbon), along with some caramel.  Sticky maple syrup on the taste and feel. The syrup lingers on the palate. Some chocolate notes, but the maple syrup is what is most present."

1380,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.99,Another legendary beer. At the time that I tasted it it was hands down the best beer I had ever had. I didn't consider myself to be a BW kind of guy but this was easily world class!
1381,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.19,"2018 Vintage, bottled on 10/16/18. Purchased at Loosa Brews, Tuscaloosa, AL. Viscous, black pour straight from the bottle. Good-looking body to the beer, with small amounts of tan head that fail to rise very high at the temperature it is poured. The head settles into a very thin ring around the beer. Right away, getting a lot of vanilla, barrel, and roasty malts on the nose. Underlying sweetness that brings out dark fruit, but a very well-balanced aromas that invite further complexity as the beer opens up and warms. Lots of espresso flavors serve the predominant force here, but is quickly balanced out by a very potent barrel presence. Oak, fudge, and hints of vanilla weave in and out, however they never seem to gain their footing long enough to keep a consistent balance. While I love all the individual components, I just seem to be getting too much roasted malts and bourbon. Body has a good viscosity, smooth with a carbonation that is present but not too sharp. Soft mouthfeel overall, with a lingering stickiness and fair amounts of mouth-coating. Warm booze down the hatch, The feel of this beer is definitely one of its strongest characteristics for me."
1382,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.47,"Pours a medium hazy orange, quarter inch silky cap. Aroma has lots of soft melon, pink grapefruit & orange. Palate is stronger on the grapefruit, a little bit of pineapple, very delicate with little bitterness."
1383,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.42,"Poured from the tall can into a pint glass. The beer is a milky dull yellow color, with visible sediment when pouring. Head is 2 fingers thick and off white with good retention. Smell is heavily citrus with a bit of honey and even some pine. Pineapple is really noticeable, almost like Dole Whip. Floral is very light. Balancing bready malt far in the back, just enough to make a presence. Fresh. Creamy and citrusy, like sherbet. Orange and pineapple most noticeable, with a creamy character throughout. Finishes light with a touch of pine and citrus peel in the back and a drying feeling. Really nice. Overall, I was feeling burned out on IPAs, bit this revived me. Really fresh and bright, and I loved the smoothness. Odd look, but thats the style? Would definitely recommend."
1384,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.75,"2017 bottle poured into a tulip. Poured tar black with a mocha frappe head. Smell is of wonderful coffee with barrel character that adds toffee and vanilla. Taste is amazing. Creamy coffee with some bourbon aspects, toffee, vanilla and woodiness. Feel is fantastic. Thick and slick. Coats the mouth. Overall, this is an outstanding beer. One of the best BA coffee stouts I’ve had."
1385,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.57,"Love the hops in this one, which is easily one of Alpine's best. The only bad thing about Keene Idea is that they (to my knowledge) haven't bottled it yet. I would stock up like crazy!"
1386,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.46,Pours dark brown. 1 finger tan head. Head retention is very good. No lacing on the glass. 
1387,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.7,"2019. Poured from fridge temp. Apricot, mild funk nose, taste follows with mild barnyard. Very well balanced between culture and fruit. Light body, excellent carb."
1388,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.5,"Pours a medium coppery amber with a big, three finger whitehead with good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops with a little dankness, orange, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Flavor is caramel malt, citrus, piney and dank hops, grapefruit, orange, pine needles, mixed tropical fruit. Citrus rind and fresh pine finish with a deep hop bitterness that is more assertive than abrasive. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I think I would have loved this even years ago, but it is even more welcome now with all the mild, soft hopped hazy ales that are so popular now. This is what I want in an IPA: great herbal hop flavors melded to aggressive alpha oil character. And this delivers. The strong ABV brings out the flavors to a fine degree. This is close in profile to a triple IPA / American barleywine depth. The combo of pine, citrus and dankness is great. It even looks like it will pack a flavor punch. This is a legend for good reason. Although we have fine IPAs in this area, I'd buy this regularly if it was available on the market here."
1389,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.43,"Pours jet black with minimal head. Smell of chocolate, barrel and slight vanilla. Taste of chocolate, maple and coffee. Neither the coffee or maple overwhelm the base stout. Feels thick and decadent but cohesive. Another great HF brew."
1390,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.11,"Pours a murky, opaque pale orange with two fingers of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is papaya, orange, mango, and some resiny, herbal hop behind. The latter comes with a little hop bite and burn, but otherwise smooth. Flavor profile is orange, mango, and papaya with herbal, medicinal, resiny hops for bitterness. Initially, lightly sweet, but quickly turns to a hop burn that comes with some muddled and mashed flavors. Mouth feel is a touch harsh on the effervescence initially and then fades to a more bubbly, chalky texture. Overall, some great qualities, but the mashing of resiny, burning hops with citrus doesn't come together well. Couple that with the bite in the texture and this is not an easy sipper. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can."
1391,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.75,Loved this beer. One of my favorite coconut stouts I've ever had. Right up there with Snowed In for me. Had this side by side with the Vanilla version and liked this a touch better. I'm a sucker for coconut.
1392,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.65,"Awesome to finally try this; great wine, light funk, touch of honey up front; Anna’s funk and honey comes through nicely, with nice sweetness, grains of paradise, mild mild tartness in back; the honey pops as it warms, super flavorful, floral finish. Wow."
1393,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.52,"Massive thanks to Francois for sharing. 2007 vintage. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a dark cherry juice hue with a thin head that faded immediately to leave thin thin wisps. S - Aromas of dry tart cherries, light vanilla. Incredibly fragrant cherries and pits.  T - Taste is similar to the nose, incredibly dry cherries, just intense tasty cherry notes. Good funky musty basement. Really good, great tart cherry notes.  M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, crisp, clean.  O - Overall this beer was really excellent. Wonderful cherry notes, excellent tartness really well crafted. Holy cow. Serving type: bottle"
1394,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.75,"An immensely great Double IPA! Super-juicy with exciting fruity and a touch of spicy notes. These guys have got their DIPA’s shit together, let that be known."
1395,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.49,"9/10/2018 release. Drank on 9/28/2019. A wealth of slightly overripe, pulpy peach - wish it were funkier or more sour, but it's fantastic, regardless."
1396,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,5.0,"Only KBBS16 is better. Vanilla, caramel/chocolate, bourbon, roast. Thic yet approachable. Perfection! This is one of a few beers that actually keep me wanting more."
1397,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.5,"Tick this beer off of my beer want list courtesy of @colts9016 in Bif13. Rated as a 100 beer on BA Waxed and capped bomber poured into snifter. Black ink motor oil, slick and viscous. No light escapes its gravity. Pencil thick brown dense foam that quickly recedes to a ring  First sniff is bourbon, roast malts,  First sip is a flood of cinnamon flavor without the heat. Finishes with licorice, char . Second sip is cinnamon and roast malts . Third sip is cinnamon, bourbon , licorice.  Slick, syrupy ,viscous liquid that coats the tongue and mouth . Rich and decadent , sweet Good beer, thanks @colts9016 for sharing this one . “ The rusty nail pounds your palate”"
1398,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,3.8,"It's definitely a unique beer, but not one I think I'd care to repeat. Maybe my pallet has been ruined by too many IPAs, but this beer just wasn't for me. The complexity was interesting though, and the look and smell were promising, but the flavor was too much for me to enjoy regularly."
1399,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.32,"Pours a dark and muddy brown with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is mocha, toffee, caramel, coffee and soothing bourbon with a kiss of char. Roasty and toasty malts form a resoundingly steady base. Flavor profile is mocha, toffee, caramel and then a searing slice of bourbon and heat. After the heat subsides, the focus goes back to lightly sugary with a heavy malt base. Malts come by way of roasty and toasty. Sweetness comes from more mocha and chocolate than try to outweigh the lingering bourbon heat. Mouth feel is thick and full with a velvety, heavy creamery texture. Overall, hot and booze with some kisses and glimpses of sweet. Balance may be a strong word here, as it veers pretty far on both sides of the heat vs. sweet spectrum, but it does all net out within each dynamic sip.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle."
1400,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,3.83,"Pours opaque, dark brown in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is dark roast coffee, chocolate, and light vanilla. Heavy bodied, roasty with moderate carbonation. Solid coffee stout with plenty of coffee flavor. You can tell this is the base for their other sweet stout. Above average. Plenty of coffee taste for coffee drinkers."
1401,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.52,"The beer pours ruby red with a medium pink head that recedes quickly. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of raspberries, cherries, funk, and cheese. It tastes tart, with raspberries, cherries, cheese, funk, and minerals. Fuller body than most lambic, and on the sweet side. A great fruited Lambic here."
1402,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.4,"On tap Hops: Citra, Galaxy, Nelson Never really thought I'd get to try a Monkish beer, especially one with a reputation as this. This was pure mango juice. Soft as a cloud."
1403,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.42,"Thanks Nick for the can! Sumptuous hazy body with a frothy white head, lacing, decent carbonation. Sharp pine and dank hops fill the nose, with peach, papaya, grapefruit, melon, orange and lemon zest. Taste stars the hops through out the sip, yet never gets resinous or heavy, great bitters, pine, dankness, and zesty pith with the fruits backing up quickly but not super defined. Feel is a technical clinic of the neipa, juicy haze and sharps perfectly defined hops crashing into each other with glorious results. Dankness, pine, juice, pith, and a mouth watering dryness, just wish it was longer lived on the palate. Great beer"
1404,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.29,"Fresh growler drank on 7/18/2017 L-kind of hazy, dark orange, light head"
1405,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.59,2014 harvest.
1406,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.88,"This beer takes everything that is lovely about purple wax Assassin and amplifies it into a sludgy, brownie-batter-dipped-in-whiskey beer. Overall, the flavor profile is akin to Assassin, with bursts of fudge and dark chocolate on the palate, followed by waves of raisiny, dark fruit flavor. The barrel presence is more pronounced, with a woodier, more bourbon-forward profile, but it never delves into the trenches of the dreaded cicerone descriptor of, ""too hot."" The mouthfeel on this beer is virtually unrivaled by any other in the game.  SR-71 is a special beer. It is not worth 2.5x Assassin 2016, though. This is one of those beers you reach for when you want that elite craft beer experience to celebrate precious moments in time."
1407,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.54,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of coconut, Swiss chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. It tastes of coconut, Swiss chocolate, creme brûlée, sugar, caramel, and vanilla. The feel is medium light, very smooth. This is probably the smoothest pastry stout i’ve ever had. The coconut really dominates, but an enjoyable beer."
1408,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,5.0,Outstanding! Had on tap. Loved it from beginning to end. Even more flavors came out as the beer warmed. This is definitely a winner! 11% abv completely hidden. Just a delicious maple treat that gets you a good buzz!
1409,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.21,This is decieving for a stout. It's more of a dark amber color and has a nice chocolate aroma. Flavor is nice mocha soaked bourbon. Body is thinner than you would expect but this is still pretty delicious.
1410,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.82,"Coconut Vibes b3 bottle I purchased from Side Project The Cellar. Pours a very deep dark black, with unusual lacing foam which dissipates relatively quickly. This leaves the just the black liquid with fine coconut bits that you could see floating around (very fine size, really). Aroma has coconut galore and milk chocolate. Milk chocolate coconut liquified Almond Joy bar, is what popped into my mind as I took first sip. Nutty and sweet, yet it works. Super well integrated coconut. No hint of artificial flavor at all. Thick! Compared to b2, this still has a load of coconut aroma, flavor, etc.... everywhere, but I think somehow is also a bit restrained relative to b2. I prefer this batch to the b2. --------------------"
1411,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.63,"You don't feel the 13% until it gets into your brain. This very impressive, extremely delicious beer is absolutely incredible for an imperial stout. Seek this out if you can. Now. Then buy as much as you can."
1412,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.38,"750ml capped bottle into Tired Hands stemware.  Nose is soap, oak, lemon, and a tart hop and citrus bite. Incredibly lively and aromatic and really tickles the tongue. Beer opens pear, citrus, a touch of lime, and lemon zest. The wine barrels are apparent towards the middle and end and lend a nice tart, oaky character. A slight hop bitterness seeps in at the end. Finishes lemon zest, oak, and wood. Delicious. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate and almost airy going down. Super drinkable with a clean, slightly dry finish. Incredibly drinkable.  One of the most quaffable beers I've had in a long time. Absolutely delicious."
1413,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.45,"Dirty gold pour, slight haze, lots of head and lace. Musty aroma, citrus, fruit, light oak. Fairly tart up front, lemon, cellar notes, lightly salty, berries, floral. Medium body."
1414,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.59,"375ml bottle. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass 3/4/2015. A- Clear light orange-copper body, one finger white head with fair retention time, not much lacing. Nice thin collar that sticks around the entire time.  S- Lactic acid, clean wheat and pale malt presence, but definitely a lot of oak and lactic acid. The grapes don't come out as much until it warms up, but it's definitely there. White grape must, not much grape juice in terms of the aroma, but that's expected. A little bit of funk, but the lacto is definitely stronger, as is the theme with all of the Side Project wild ales. F- Wheat, lactic acid, oak, a bit of funk, white grape must. This tastes an awful lot like Fuzzy but without the peaches, and plenty of white grape. This does not deliver a lot of actual white wine character, but rather more of white grape must. That's actually what I seem to prefer, and it's remarkably tasty. That being said, it's also quite tart, similar to how tart Blueberry Flanders was but not quite to the point where it's a turn-off. M- Medium bodied, silky crispness is very refreshing. The tartness starts burning up your jaws immediately. Very tasty with a lot of nice depth to it. Easy to drink, even with the tartness. O- Delicious stuff. I enjoyed this one a lot and continue to expect this level of excellence from Side Project, because they keep delivering these hits one after another."
1415,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.59,"I don't review often. But when I do, it's Alexandria Whaelz. HUGE thanks to Bill A for sharing this. Drank along side the non barreled version. Bottle from 2007. A - Very dark brown, bordering on completely black. Medium tan head that lingers for awhile. I should have used a different glass, I'm an idiot. S - Not a ton going on here. A good amount of roast, some oaky vanilla notes that come in secondary. As the bottle warmed up, I got the ""Burgundy pepper"" as described below. T - Strap in. The roast is all up front until an amazing mocha blast in the mid palate. The ending is some vanilla and barrel. There is a slight earthy pepper type of thing going on during the finish. The only time I have experienced something similar is in a handful of other barrel aged beers and in aged red Burgundy's. It's awesome though.  M - Rich and creamy without bogging down the beer at all. Intensely drinkable for the barrel and style and ABV. Zero alcohol on the back end. O - This was amazing. It's been one of my top wants for years and I wasn't sure I'd ever get a chance to try it. To be able to do it back to back with the regular version really showcases what the barrel does to this beer. It truly is a shame that this beer is so incredibly limited and expensive. I will forever be indebted to Bill for allowing me to try this with him!"
1416,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.21,"L: A darker filtered orange with an sizable ivory head settling down to a wisp and a wide band that climbs the glass and leaves a couple narrow partial bands of lace. S: Malt Bomb, medicinal pine, and citrus syrup. T: Follows the nose, there’s an unexpected clove note in there too. Pretty strong. Bitter And resinous like the West coast doubles of old. F: Heavier weight, malty and sticky and a good stomach full. Right carbonation. Off-dry with a drier and bitter finish. O: If you like’em malty this is well done. Overall I personally would not put it at number five however. A bit of hype."
1417,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.68,"2013 vintage poured into a Lost Abbey Teku.  Aromas are oak and spices, citrus, fruity wild yeast, and overripe fruits.  On the tongue is citrus and lactic, funky, wine, oak, followed by dry tannins, oak aftertaste, green apple. Mildly dry aftertaste. High carbonation with a nice easy drinking body.  A great beer indeed, one of the most balanced wild's I've ever tasted. Worth breaking out the big guns to trade for it."
1418,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.85,Thanks to johndoe8 for this badass brew. 2009 vintage A-dark body with a mocha head that disapates slowly S-smooth oak and bourbon undertones that take a little bit of twirling to bring out T-now that's a fucking beer. Wow. Follows the nose. Very subtle oak and bourbon tthat is just wonderful M-medium body and smooth O-very fucking good. Worth the €30-40? Prolly not
1419,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,"Ok, formalities: Thiiick & full-bodied. Blow-your-head-off nose, with all the Xmas you can possibly picture in your mind, in this bottle. Cinnamon, those pink peppercorns, choc... just mind blowingly great"
1420,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.47,"Received from @bum4ever in a BIF box. Poured from cork and cage bottle into a teku glass. It pours a pretty ruby-orange color. The thin, ecru-colored head dissipated rapidly. On the nose there is red wine, oak, cherry, brown sugar, and Brett yeast. It's highly fragrant. As expected, it's both sweet and sour with tart cherry and currant, red wine grapes, and vinegar, tobacco and oak notes. It finishes surprisingly bitter. The flavors blend very well. It is well-carbonated and drinks below its 10% ABV. Overall, it is a highly flavorful and pleasing ale. I'm very happy to have had the chance to savor it."
1421,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.46,On tap:
1422,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.63,"L - pours a surprisingly translucent brown coming out of the bottle, but settles into something much more opaque with dark cherry red fringes. I guess this is ""only"" a porter after all. Creamy, whipped cream tan head with some aggressively sticky lacing. Leaves a fine film on the edges of my glass. The head color is simply divine. S - burst of chile pepper with spiced hot chocolate and cinnamon powder. Getting the usual spice suspects a la cardamom, nutmeg, and allspice. Nails those Mexican Hot Chocolate vibes. T - fresh and lively flavors of iced coffee, chili powder (sans heat), and cool whip. Sharp dark chocolate, two creams, and brown sugar. Whipped cacao butter. Maple smooths out any harsh chili heat, and we're just left with pepper flavor, none of the undesirable spiciness.  F - far creamier than I was expecting, based on the look and nose. Buttered cream, but light enough to make this exceedingly palatable. As close to drinking a cloud as you're gonna get. Soft as that steering wheel cover I got my gf for Christmas. It was so soft, I almost got into an accident because I couldn't stop dragging my hands around it in a circle. O - delightfully restrained in its balance of flavor. I'm reminded that it's just a porter, and Kane makes every attempt to keep this light and playful, while honing in on the flavors they're after. Mexican Hot Chocolate. Don't have to worry about those heavy stout flavors clouding the focus here. Lactose rounds off all the sharp corners and we're left with something not quite what I was expecting, but perhaps better."
1423,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.25,"Pours a hazy medium golden color, abundant foamy head that lasts. Aroma is light citrus and tropical fruit. I get guava, mango, lemon. Flavor is citrusy - lemon, grapefruit, some dankness and light bitterness that disappears on the finish. Good carbonation. Overall a very good IPA. I like Julius a bit more. And jjj way more. 4/30/21"
1424,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.17,"Enjoyable to sip, but there was too much of a singular maple and cola dominance in the flavor to put this beer in the top-echelon for me. With less maple this would be all time. That being said, the mouthfeel/body is really pleasant and the 9% is well hidden."
1425,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.6,"Alpine's litmus test to me involved having Keene Idea (originally Toronado's 25th Anniversary beer) on a beer list already with outstanding beers. I prefer not to use tasters because I like to soak up a greater experience with a given beer, so after a round a Nelson, Keene Idea had a high mark to hit. On to the beer: This beer is light orange colored and topped with a short head with solid retention on top. I took a smell of the beer, and at that moment I was assured by the USDA that I had consumed my daily requirement of fruit, as this beer is big on fruit! A smash to the head with passionfruit, followed closely by succulent guava, cantaloupe and mango. There's no way that a stablemate of Nelson can be better tasting, could it? At times, I thought that Keene Idea had climbed Mount Everest to be with Nelson. While overall it doesn't quite hit that stratospheric peak, Keene Idea is undoubtedly outstanding beer. The beer is not bitter, yet full of hoppiness and more. The tastes of orange, passionfruit, and guava are unashamedly fantastic, and that alcohol level does not cross the palate immediately, further making my pint dangerously drinkable. It's full bodied and very smooth, and already being such a great beer, felt that this beer was not playing fair.  Keene Idea is a beer that I'm sure made Dave Keene smile from ear to ear. This is a fantastic beer!!"
1426,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.58,"Appearance - From the bottle, the beer poured a slick black color with a mocha colored head. Smell - The nose was composed largely of syrupy chocolate. I did not detect the cinnamon in the nose as much as I thought it would.  Taste - My first thought was that this is like cinnamon oatmeal cookies. There were also chocolate and tobacco notes mixed in. The cinnamon was well balanced with the bourbon. The slight warming feeling never felt like an outrageous cinnamon burn.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation was present, though very mild. Overall - this was a great example of a cinnamon stout. It did not burn my esophagus and it was not too sweet."
1427,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.6,2016 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. This beer has aged well to this point. Tons of chocolate in the flavor with some touches of espresso contributing to a slightly dry finish. Black Note is a beer I'll continue to seek whenever available.
1428,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,3.61,"12 oz. bottle, marked 07/27/19, sampled 05/09/21. A little long to wait, bought it off the shelf 3 weeks ago, so the brewer takes any hits on aging, they left it there for purchase.  Appearance: Black glass, thin halo of tan bubbles, no lacing. Aroma: Heavy vegetative chili note, burned barrel, some underlying malt sweetness. Taste: Medicinal alcohol, green pepper, some sweetness comes in deep into the taste, a little coffee in the finish. Hard to get many ""beer"" flavors out of this, even imperial stout flavors. Some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit. Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, low, almost flat carbonation, little oily in the finish but pretty clean. Overall: I love Prairie bombs, I've enjoyed a lot of the variations, this one not so much. I think all the additions overwhelm the yummy base beer, and it just comes across as a little gimmicky. The vegetable note really throws me. Maybe this one sat too long, the date code is all but invisible on the bottle."
1429,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,3.58,"Can @ Monkish. As with Haze, a milky orange beer with white foam. This one isn’t quite as enjoyable as regular Haze, in my opinion. It’s a little more sweet and caramel forward and also has a more pronounced resinous and pithy bitterness. Still has some nice peach, grapefruit, orange, and dried pineapple hop character, though. It’s fine enough, but not great."
1430,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,3.5,"Taster at BW share. Medium, murky amber, kind of flat. Aroma is strong and malty, kind of medicinal. Taste smooths out Abit sweet and dusty. A bit of dryness and some booze."
1431,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.84,Wow! Got a bottle of the 2014 a while back and have been sitting on it for awhile. The whisky is there but well hidden. Very sweet. Velvety thick mouthfeel. Nearly perfect!
1432,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.35,"From a 16oz can dated 11/17/20 into a pint glass. Message on can: ""Right you are, Ken"" Note: abv is listed at 8.3% Pours a pale opaque yellow with about one finger of white head. Great retention and lacing. Smells of citrus-oranges, tangerines, grapefruit and some pineapple.  Taste follows...quite a bit of juice in the taste with a moderately bitter back end of the swallow.  Mouthfeel is soft and full bodied, maybe one of the softest feeling beers I've ever had. Nice bitter aftertaste. Moderate carbonation. Overall, a great beer. I think I was expecting a little more from it, but wouldn't ever be turning this one down."
1433,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.05,"32oz growler courtesy of LoPo87. Thanks! Small 3 oz pour. A: Thick as motor oil. No head. Legs on the glass like the lamp from A Christmas Story. N: Intense caramel, cotton candy, brown sugar, coffee, fudge. This is mostly sugar, though, hence the score. T: Good god. Diabetes. Cinnamon, chocolate, coffee, a little bit of soy sauce. A very slight pepper. Lots of dark fruits. Alcohol is well hidden. Pretty much the epitome of throw everything into the kettle.  M: Heaviest beer I've ever tried. A little bit of carbonation. Expands and contracts all over my palate. O: There's almost no apple brandy so deducting some points there. Honestly, this is amazing, and then it's way too much. I compared it to the way Nibbler must feel in Futurama as well as making the Mitch Hedberg joke that it's like pancakes: When it starts, it's amazing, by the time you're done, you're sick of 'it."
1434,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.8,"Shared from a 750 at the cellar. A Beautiful beer with strong fruit nose, a wonderful balance of tartness. As it warms up it gets better. Reminded me of my Aunt Edna jarring her own jelly in the kitchen when I was a kid. Phenomenal."
1435,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.46,"12 oz can canned 9/9/19 poured into a tulip glass, a golden hazy orange with half finger white head. Aroma is all pine,grapefruit, and maybe some cantaloupe? The taste is very balanced between some malt/sugar notes and the hop citrus flavor profile. The alcohol is barely noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, carbonation level is medium low. A pretty tasty balanced triple."
1436,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,5.0,Just the perfect representation of what a West Coast IPA should be. Loads of pine and very slight citrus on the nose and palate. Clear. Wonderful balance between the body and hops.

1440,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.57,"Had this 2018 version on draft. Super smoooth. Coffee flavor in just the right amount, dark chocolate, roasty malts, woody notes, a touch of dark fruit and caramel. High ABV hidden by the rich flavors. Excellent imperial stout, 96."
1441,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.49,"The beer comes in a light to medium gold color with a light chill haze, medium head with great lacing and medium minus sustain.  The aroma offers dried pineapple, peach jelly rings, cantaloupe, rich green weed, green grass, potted soil, and cat pee.  The flavor hits upfront with that candied melon and tropical sweetness, with a layered earthy soil and weed base tone through the entire experience. Bitterness is medium to medium plus with earthy notes. Drinkability and smoothness is insanely high without any caramel sweetness and a hit of alcohol on the back and on the way down.  This is relevant to many dry West Coast brews. Boneyard is my closest comparison. It's definitely not worth the hunt and the almost decade it took me to review this, but it sure is aromatic, drinkable, and dry."
1442,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.98,"Rich, smooth texture. Slight but not overpowering bourbon scent and taste. Not so boozy as to take away from the stout richness. Great chocolate left on the back."
1443,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.57,"2018 vintage tasted in a snifter from draft at O'Toole's on February 5, 2019. A celebration of malt, oak and patience. Very Special Old [Straight] Jacket is a cuvée of English barleywines each aged between two and three years in bourbon barrels. Lusciously sweet and colossally complex, V.S.O.J. is equal parts refinement and excess."
1444,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.25,"GTFO with all these wildly overhyped reviews. This was to say the least overhyped, however it is not a bad beer by any stretch. Smell is sweet, chocolate, bourbon. Flavor is chocolate, raisins and bourbon. Body medium. Nice feel to it. Good carb. Overall smooth, but nothing stunning This is dramatically better than BCBS 2017, but at this point that is no longer the bar"
1445,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.89,"A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing S: Tropical fruit and citrus up front with grapefruit leading the way. Peach and melon also at the front T: Follows the nose. Super dialed in with the tropical fruit and citrus, especially the grapefruit and melon notes. Alcohol slightly warming. Finishes with lingering citrus and melon M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Soft and pillowy O: Wow. What little the nose is lacking is made up for and then some with the taste and feel. I wasn’t sure Very Hazy could make it to another level, but this proved me wrong. Everything great about Haze and Very Hazy just super dialed in and amplified. I’m not sure how this is scratching at 9%, but it is. Very dangerous in the drinkability category. A must-try"
1446,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.57,"A - Pours pitch black with a one finger tan head. Nice amount of sticky lacing. S - Aroma is coffee, vanilla, coocnut and bourbon. T - The taste coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, cocnut, toffee and bourbon. M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish. O - The hype is real on this one. Tremendous balance of flavors and deceptively smooth for 13.1%."

1448,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.6,"Bottled 9.18.20, opened 12.31.20 Room Temperature in tall rounded pilsner glass. Look: It is black. Totally black. Even around the edges no hind of color. Spilled on the light color counter (just a couple drops by accident) no hind of color. Head retention was poor. Started out dense bubbles on top and small almost like a nitro on bottom. Quickly dissipated. Typical of warm beer. Smell: Not strong. You have to wait for it to fill the the glass. Very pleasant and complex. Taste 1: When first hits the tongue It fills the mouth in a pleasant way before you even drink it in."
1449,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,5.0,"This is an amazing beer. Pale gold, with a big sticky head. It smells like orange zest, lemon and pithiness with some floral notes and sweet malt. The taste is full of orange zest, tangerine and pith with hints of lemon and some spiciness. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Great bitterness with a clean finish. Just a really great beer."
1450,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.89,BEST PART OF WAKING UP 050619 stamp by rim. Poured into a snifter.  A: Black with 1-2 finger dark beige head with good retention and sparse lacing.  S: Unbelievably uncanny aroma of pancakes with butter and syrup with black coffee more present with warming.  T: The flavor is unfortunately hampered by a strong bitter burned coffee note and then extract-chemical character in the finish and aftertaste. The maple is strongest early and then fades. The background stout also doesn't come through much. Disappointing given the unbelievable aroma.  M: Hides the 11% well with smoothness but slight extract tang in the finish O: Double Stack has good points and bad points. I am fairly sensitive to the artificial/chemical extract flavor and feel so it can rear its head in a beer like this one for me depending on the reliance on on extracts to get the finished flavor and feel.
1451,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.29,"Big thanks to jrc1093 for this one! 12oz can - dated 12/18/20 - poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at 38°F.  Pours a murky, stained ruddy orange hue, topped with three fingers of dense, foamy, off-white head with excellent retention, leaving a sheet of lacing as it slowly recedes.  Nose: Citra out the wazoo. Massive fresh Citra hop aromas, with orange peel, orange pulp, grapefruit pith, pomello, orange creamsicle, mango skin, drippy, resinous, raw green hops, and a touch of yeast-driven bubblegum, all contained within a simple, grainy pale malt base. Explosive and insanely hop-forward. Palate: The beer greets the palate with grainy, slightly toasty, flakey pale malt, with a bit of underlying sweetness, parallel to huge hoppy citrus notes - orange peel, grapefruit pith, pomello, and a touch of lemon. There's a tropical touch of luscious mango, and a hint of melon, followed by a big grassy green note, and a subtle overdrive dankness. There's some pretty noticeable minerality that sparkles through as well. The finish sees the pithy notes take over, lending a resinous, chalky-dry bite with a bit of lingering oily bitterness. Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is pretty fluid and drinkable, with a crisp medium body. Effervescence is fizzy and ample, but very soft and tame, and paired with the unusual minerality, it really lends a bright crispness. The heavy dry-hop, fluffy malt, and hop oils lend additional softness and body, but the finish dries out nicely with some digging bitterness.  Overall: A brilliant showcase of Citra hops that somehow manages to cram an explosion of hop flavour into a 6.2% ABV package. It finds balanced between single IPA drinkability and double IPA saturation. There's a lot of Tree House flavour similarities here, and tge beer manages to borrow traits from multiple IPA styles and sew them together here to create something that feels hyper-refined, while still being incredibly bold."
1452,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.26,2016 purple ball. Sweet coconut milk. This is really sweet; probably due to addition of turbinado sugar in addition to the coconut. Slight alcohol burn on the back end. One dimensional pure coconut with a slick mouthfeel that lingers. Very enjoyable.
1453,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.33,You might hate them or love them but this looks the NEIPA part nice bright haze with glow yellow orange .strong smells ripe tropical notes without the rotten notes .
1454,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.49,"Giant killer beer that has the amazing aroma of chocolate, bourbon, coffee, oak, vanilla. Very sweet beer with lower carbonation. Tons of chocolate and coffee with strong bourbon. Amazingly this beer hides it's monstrous ABV. There is a little alcohol heat at the end but it is balanced. This is an awesome beer."
1455,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.44,With so much talk about this being a disappointment This beer was fantastic. Has a slight chili smell. This is some chili up front followed by nice barrel flavor.some spice comes through and had a rich body. Overall really delicious.
1456,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.4,"Pours a lovely bright yellow-orange color. Completely opaque, but it does avoid that sludgy appearance that you get from some of the NE style IPAs. Thick, pillowy white head dissipates slowly, but steadily leaving just a thin splotch of foam on top of the head. Lots of sticky white lacing coats the glass as the beer is consumed. I did leave about an inch of the beer in the bottle - that had a lot of sediment in it, so had I poured all of it in the glass at once, I do think I would have gotten that sludgy appearance.  Aroma is a bright, lush bouquet of mango, orange, orange creamsicle, cantaloupe, tangerine and a hint of pineapple. There is a slight greenish tinge to the aroma it what I tend to get from these beers that use dry hopping.  Taste follows the nose with notes of orange tangerine, pineapple, mango, and cantaloupe. Im even getting a light berry - blueberry and raspberry - note in the profile. The bitterness is subdued on the palate, but you can feel that hop burn building as you drink the beer.  Feel is moderately bodied, pretty smooth. Moderate carbonation. Surprisingly dry on the back end.  Overall its a nice DIPA - I honestly do not know that the double dry hopping really did much to improve on the original King Sue. And while I do not know that I've pick this on up again, I did really enjoyed drinking it."
1457,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.21,"Canned 02-05, pours a slightly cloudy golden with a small white cap that fades to a ring. Aromas are subdued with only slight notes of citrus and pine mixed with a really nice doughy/crackery malt. Flavors are another story altogether! Immediate burst of vegetal hops and somewhat bitter pith character. Mouthfeel is fairly light for the abv, and the finish is slightly bitter AND slightly sweet simultaneously. Nice change of pace."
1458,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.5,"Hazy peachy appearance. Smell of pineapple and tropical. Creamy, fuzzy, pleasant balance with hints of sweet and dank. It’s just delicious and a real treat. I think I will have another!"
1459,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.74,"2018 vintage - drank on 7/14/2019. Unbelievable how much a barrel does to this beer. It's tremendously thick and the coffee is warm, lightly roasty, and sweet. Incredible beer."
1460,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,5.0,"Kochere variant (apple brandy) - drank 7/13/2019. Bottle opened at Hill Farmstead - incredible surprise. Best beer of the weekend. Layered, rich, amazing apple brandy. So incredible."
1461,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.2,"Poured a black body with one-finger head khaki head with minor lace. Mild espresso aroma of roasted coffee with some hints of lactic quality. Smooth, thick, heavy, easy to drink, well-hidden ABV, slightly cocoa sweet and roasted (and slightly sticky) coffee taste and so easy to drink. Well-balanced beer that is a must-try."
1462,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.25,"2016 vintage - drank on 4/26/2019. A ton of peach and fairly funky - lots of brett character. Very good, though the body and mouth feel leaves something to be desired."
1463,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.5,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Yellow Session. Aroma has fresh roasted coffee, even crushed coffee beans. Taste has bittersweet coffee with sugar, quite balanced flavors, malty background, light chili heat on the finish."
1464,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.46,Bottled 2016 (I think? It’s hard to read) 
1465,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.06,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours dark brown. Nose is cranberry juice, sour, and sweet. Taste is dark fruit, juice, a bit of syrup, and sweet. Really nice, but this had a few years on it. Might be better fresh."
1466,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.63,"I have had several vintages of this and I must say I like it more young. The wine is not overbearing but provides a brightness that is just wonderful. Dark fruit on the nose and palate. Some funk, but not overbearing. It was more like blackberry or jam than wine but this was tasty."
1467,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.77,Bottle from 3 Fonteinen tasting room. Amazing amazing beer. Mild sweetness from the raspberries with and intense acidic quality to the beer. The barnyard wet leather comes through at the end. Well worth seeking out.
1468,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.69,"A tale of 3 beers, all Pliny the Elder."
1469,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.25,The first whiff and sip of this beer is incredible. Cinnamon stands out most prominent over the nice coffee in the background. It's like a warm cinnabun. The only problem with this beer is it's quite sweet and it starts to take its toll if you have a whole glass. nb
1470,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,3.83,"Pours a clouded golden yellow with a medium sized sized, spongy head. Smells of leathery basement, mushrooms, sweet candy and a touch of vinegar. Offers a rustic, crushed grain quality with a note of white bread dough. Has a flowery note atop, making this pleasantly complex. A bright, sparkly effervescence defines the beer’s mouthfeel, finishing with a long lasting bitterness. Has a dustiness to it, which numbs the taste from start till the end with a distractingly acetic sourness, partially covered by dried mushrooms and old leather. Hints of oak and old cork are cutting through, establishing a well working, unique balance, tied together by white bread dough and a slightly spicen yeast foundation. Has a dried leaves dryness during the finish with an ongoing funkiness providing an intriguing depth. Reminding me more of a sour than of a traditional saison. That being said, this is very interesting to me, based on its strong headed rustic character, which is actually hard to compare to anything else. I assume its their house character, which is very appealing since it offers a never before experienced melange of dried nuts, mushrooms, vinegar and lots of basement oak. I like it. I think."
1471,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.71,"2017 vintage. Tremendous taste and nose. Light coconut, spice, plenty of cinnamon. Not a very pronounced barrel presence, but it's there. It's surprising how excellent this is, but being a fan of the base beer, it should probably be expected. Well done, Cigar City. I know a lot of people look past Huna these days - it's impossible to overlook BA Huna!"
1472,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.62,"04/2016 - as it warms, the fruit, funk, and oak ripen and delight the senses; the nectarine is lovely, but doesn't overwhelm the senses; digging the mouthfeel of this; traditional dG acidity in the back of the palate; juicy, sour, funky finish."
1473,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,3.52,"The beer is an orange juice gold color. Smallish white head. Very cloudy. Head dissipates quickly. The aroma is big on apricots. Pretty good lacto note. Not much funk. Quite a nice juicy fruit aroma. The taste is very sour. You get some nice fruit but the acidity is just too aggressive for me. There seems to be a nice beer hidden underneath that monster sour kick, and it's a real shame that you can't really taste it well. Some oak - a bit of a buttery white wine flavor - and apricots come through, but both are well in the background. Mostly lacto sourness, mostly just tastes like neutral acidity. Big pucker. Lots of back of the throat sour, phlegmy feeling in the finish. Fairly light body. As I wrote before, there's a good beer in there, but it's so sour that you lose complexity and depth of flavor."
1474,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.5,"Traditional Big West Coast IPA out of Ohio. Balanced with tropical aromas, the bitterness is evident but not overwhelming. Dank, citrus, piney resin. Only complaint is the alcohol is quite noticeable. Check it out given the opportunity."
1475,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.22,Pours gold. There's some pepper like particulate in the bottom of my glass.I'm not getting that much aroma. May be some jasmine. This beer is super dry with some juicy apricot flavors. I'm not getting a ton of sweetness.
1476,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,5.0,Oh my.
1477,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.32,Haven't had this one in over a year but always worth checking in a classic like this! Worth the hours-long wait in the rain just for the experience alone. Even got a sweet Pliny the Younger poncho to boot!
1478,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.35,"Poured from a cork'n'cage bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. 2018 edition. L: Dark, dark pour... nearly black with a bit of mahogany around the edges. 1 finger of tannish head leaves a nice thin ring of lacing. S: Rich and roasty... bourbon and booze mixed with vanilla and cocoa. T.F: Dark and charred... like the soul of your ex. Sweet-ish up front with espresso, vanilla, bourbon, and dark chocolate. Bitter roast balances things out nicely. Medium bodied... sticky on the tongue and more complex/delicious as it warms up to room temp. O: An outstanding big barrel aged Russian Imperial. As arrogant as you'd expect from Stone. Fantastic, and glad I've got another bottle to cellar for a few."
1479,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.91,I picked up several cans and the beer is almost perfect. The fruit taste and aroma stand out. I loved the beer but the staff at the Canton location were not friendly. A simple thank you would have gone a long way to enhance the experience. Note that the staff at the Greenway Beer Garden location were professional and friendly.
1480,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.04,"Standard black with a khaki head. Rich coffee, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and bourbon nose. Taste starts with the deep coffee, but then gets fruity with the raisin, date and plum with chocolate and slight wood before coffee takes back over. Given the rating expected it to be more dynamic and less aggressive with the flavor shifts but booze is integrated and hidden very well. Feel is dry, airy for style, not too warm or hot, and lightly roasted compared to the taste. It was good but overrated, many good coffee ba stouts out there that are more worth your time"
1481,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.79,"L-Dark brown body with beige foam with proper thickness, which is lovely at first glance."
1482,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.88,"Smooth, tasty, and delicious smelling. What else can I say? Basically if a stout and a maple syrup covered pancake joined forces and had a baby together you'd get this beer. Would've liked a hint of bacon, but overall I can't complain."
1483,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.53,"I assumed this beer wouldn’t live up - but it was great. Not too sour, complex with some interesting wine character, went well with Portillos Italian beef!"
1484,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,5.0,"West Coast meets New England. Strong, but not boozy. Very bitter, but with a hearty backbone. Goes down much easier than expected. Tbh, I think I might like this better than Heady."
1485,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.41,500mL bottle
1486,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.53,"A: Pours a near pitch black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap S: Roasted malt, maple syrup, coffee, dark chocolate, and cocoa all stick out. Some caramel and vanilla in there as well T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of roasted malt, maple syrup, and milk chocolate. Picks up the coffee and some dark chocolate. Caramel also present. Finishes with lingering roast and maple syrup M: Full bodied with low-moderate carbonation O: A great stout that hits heavy with the maple. Coffee and chocolate also very prevalent. Makes for a nice sipper even with the modest 7.7%. Worth checking out"
1487,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.54,"Pours our like motor oil. Almost no brown coloration. I figured an aggressive pour would be fine, but I guess I was incorrect. It yielded a huge head. Not expected. It's hard to tell with some stouts. Dark brown foam.  Nose is roasty coffee, chocolate, and some sweetness. Very pleasant, simple.  Taste is...wow. The presence of maple right up front was not noticed on the nose. But hot damn, right there it is. Not hogging the spotlight however, it's quickly followed up by that deep roasty coffee and mild chocolate. It tastes like a cup of coffee perfectly sweetened up with maple instead of sugar. Balanced almost perfectly between flavor and sweetness.  Mouthfeel is fullbodied with mild carbonation. Most likely due to the involvement of the lactose. Smooth and rich. Not too sticky or cloying.  Another nice stout from Tree House. Showing their prowess as not only master crafters of IPAs but skilled makers of the dark stuff. Well done."
1488,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.15,"Canned on 9/30/20; consumed on 10/18/20 Pours a turbid mango-gold body topped with a rounded, fluffy two and a half fingers of white foam; excellent head retention leaves a mound of cap, a slight, frothy collar, and a moderate spread of soapy, spotty lacing around the walls of the glass. Aroma shows traces of resin as it opens, withholding overripe peach, papaya, hints of bready malt, and guava briefly as the bouquet develops; creamier tones of mango build, further accentuating guava, tangerine zest, and slight suggestions of peach and pink grapefruit over time; a lush, tropical bouquet with defined, hoppy edges. Taste offers lime sherbet upfront, a semi-tart introduction to what is eventually a touch piney over the mid-palate and effectively accented with peppery, pithy citrus zest; pineapple, bay leaf, and apricot zest show depth into the back end as overripe mango and sweet bready malts shine into the finish. Mouthfeel brings a medium body alongside a mild carbonation deferring to a significant creamy texture dominant into the mid-palate, where a prickly resin into the back end glides toward an increasingly slick, stiff, yet easy finish. A great entry into the NETIPA category, perpetuating in equal parts the tempered abrasion matched by the burly profile which can be found in this (sub-) style; a pointed alcohol presence, abundance of flavor, and creamy, weighted texture to tie it all together; spectacularly consumable 11.5% ABV."
1489,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.33,"Shared with friends at CBC Como on 1-27-18. 2017 version(blue label). Pours about as black as it gets with no real head to speak of. Great nose, with hints of cinnamon and spice predominant, and a hint of barrel. From there, I guess I was a bit let down. Having the regular version on a few occasions, I was expecting the barrel treatment to give this beer a boost. Instead, the flavors come off a little muddled. Yes, I got some cinnamon, cocoa, and chilies(most unaffected), but they were struggling to the forefront with the presence of the barrel itself."
1490,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.77,"2018 vintage - Pours dark brown-black with a khaki tan foam head. Smells like maple toast, roasty nutty bready malts, graham crackery, slight coconut, dark fruits, hint of dried cherry, maple syrup, bourbon, oak, mild vanilla, caramel, chocolate, some coffee, light smokiness, with mild earthy hops. Tastes like dark cherry, dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, nutty roasted malts, coffee, toasted bread, maple syrup, vanilla, bourbon, oak barrel, mild smoke, hint of coconut, graham cracker, maple toast, with earthy hops to balance. Smooth thick medium body, moderate low carbonation. Really nice bourbon barrel aged imperial porter with maple syrup."

1492,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.36,"2016 bottle L - 1.5 finger dense hazelnut head atop a pitch black body. S - caramel, bourbon, coconut, chocolate. Yum. T - wow. Sweet caramel, coconut candies, drinking chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla, molasses. Low bitterness. Moderate-high sweetness. Low booziness. F - medium body and carb. O - very sweet, but booze is completely hidden and the coconut makes this a winner."
1493,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.66,L - Pours a pitch black with light brown head.
1494,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.59,"This one pours a mega hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing. This smells like mango, peach, orange zest, pine resin, and some grassiness. It definitely leaps out of the glass. This is one of the best Trillium IPAs I've had in a bit now. It's got such a big juicy note with a balancing but minimal bitterness. Fruits noticed included peach, mango, grapefruit, orange, etc. There's no malt character. This is medium bodied, and finishes fairly dry, but with no lingering bitterness. It goes down quite easily. This is supremely excellent. It was a joy to drink."
1495,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,5.0,"Let’s be honest, when it comes to vanilla specific barrel aged stouts this sits comes unrivaled. I dream of finding a D13, but until that day. This is perfection."
1496,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.5,"Priciest beer I've bought to date -- ~$50 in Belgium. Sat on this for about a year awaiting the right occasion, and my friend's bachelor party seemed like a great time to bring it out. Simply put, this is a wonderful lambic that is overflowing with raspberry character. The clean funky-tartness of the base lambic complements the intense raspberry nicely and the drinkability is top-notch, as per usual with 3 Fonteinen. Reminded me a lot of Allagash's Coolship Red, which is a more reasonably priced and (relatively) easily available alternative.  90/100"
1497,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.86,"2011 Bottle. Really nice and sweet, thick body, smelled very nice and sweet. Mouth feel was the best part. Really nice and thick, sweetness stayed well after the sip."
1498,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.71,"Format: Crowler - March 2016 Appearance: Thick, viscous, non transparent - head recedes quickly but dark brown while it lasts, almost oily from the coconut (other variants don't have this appearance) "
1499,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.75,"This is worth all of the hype. I bought a vintage 2008 bottle about a month ago when I was at Toronado in SF, and I was not disappointed. For an 8 year old beer, this was incredible complex."
1500,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.6,"Batch 2 is a delicious beer with just the right amount of sour, funk, and barrel presence... pillowy and light but with a nice full mouthfeel.... very balanced with complex flavors that keep coming for minutes after you swallow.... worthy of the hype!"
1501,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.61,"One of those beers that, upon first sip, totally stopped me in my tracks and had me lean back in the couch and just say - ""wow."" Delicious beer. Simply delicious. Not sure of the bottling variations or release date but this Vietnamese Coffee version was picked up in Ohio during Thanksgiving, stored appropriately since and enjoyed three months later. I'm never too concerned with some age on coffee beers as most hit me as being a little to acidic. Coal-black pour with a thin head that fades quickly to fait wisps of brown bubbles. On par with the normal look of the style. Aroma seems to have some Turkish coffee or even cardamom going on mixed in the with roasted malt, toasted oak, flaked coconut, semi-sweet chocolate morsels and booze. Let me say this - for a 15% ABV beer the booze is very manageable.  Taste is outrageously good - semi-sweet dark chocolate, dark dark dark ground coffee grounds, kiss of Raisonette and Milk Dud, roasted grains, and bourbon oak. Like a bourbon-dipped, boozy coffee fudge brownie with flaked fucking coconut. Somehow not cloying at all. Thick, viscous, heavy on the palate - it's a substantial beer that takes up all the space in your mouth but that's not a bad thing. Finishes way too fast. Perfectly balanced lingering sweetness cut by a touch of coffee bitterness. World class."
1502,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.42,Poured from a bottle. Pours extremely hazy with significant head - looks almost like a glass of orange juice. Strong citrus aroma. Not particularly bitter or sweet - strikes a great balance. This is a great IPA.
1503,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.69,"Shared with a few non-craft friends.  Everyone might have just turned the table on appreciation of sour beers. Everyone was telling me what they tasted before I could intrude with my insight. They were all spot on! Some were not sure if they enjoyed it, but all were glad they tried it. One of the softest beers I have ever had. Perfect fruit presence, with more lingering in the finish than up front."
1504,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.56,Thank you bl00 for this
1505,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.2,(Review added 06/27/18)
1506,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.43,"Pours blacker than black, hardly any head coming off this thing. No lacing but does have some flakes of coconut dandruff floating on the surface. The smell is a mix of deep roasted malts and some molasses. The taste is sweet and roasty, some coconut and dark fruit. The feel is slick and oily with a sting to it from the booze. Overall an outstanding stout."
1507,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.86,"L- pours a hazy orange color with a half inch head that dissipates fairly quickly. S- smell o f tropical notes, very fruity. Apricots come to mind.. wife says fruit roll up lol.. T- very smooth.. not much boozyness to it but you can tell it is a strong beer. F- stays on the tongue for a while.  O- for a 11.5 % beer this is awesome. "
1508,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.83,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with tan head. Huge coffee aroma with some bourbon. Taste is thick and chewy. No booziness to it. Flavors of caramel, molasses, coffee, cocoa, bourbon. Dangerously drinkable."
1509,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.52,"Batch #7 poured from fridge temp on 9/26/2020  Pours a ruby red with a small white head that leaves a ring of lacing.  Nose is of strong sweet and sour cherry, cinnamon, oak, and vanilla, floral cherry.  Taste follows the nose with sweet cherry, cinnamon, mild oak, mild vanilla, cherry blossom, vinegar.  Feel is light/medium body and hits the tip of the tongue with a burst of carb.  Overall, excellent wild that utilizes two great and contrasting cherries that blend well together."
1510,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,3.28,A decent stout that I forgot to log when I drank it. I could get the coffee and chocolate but it still lacked the thickness that I was looking for. At 8.2 ABV it still lacked the punch that I was looking for.
1511,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.71,"6oz. Pour.  Dark browm/black with a small mocha head.  Smells of rich chocolate, caramel and coconut. Taste mimics the nose. Sweet but manages to not become cloying. Great flavors that meld together well. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy with low carbonation. My first Angry Chair experience and quite a good one. Expensive but definately worth a shot."
1512,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.56,"From a 750 ml bottle to a tulip.  A-A normal pour produces very little head; just a thin pink cap that fades quickly to a collar. The beer is raspberry in color and slightly cloudy. Nothing spectacular to look at, but it suits the style. S-The aroma on this older (2011) bottle is subdued compared to some lambics, but I still smell a good bit of sour cherry. Other scents include champagne, cider vinegar, and a light dose of earthy, barnyard funk. Acidity is moderate to low for the style. T-The taste is flush with clean acidity, as well as some mostly-dry oaky funk, and more of that lovely sweet/sour cherry taste. It is very balanced and impresses with its focus rather than outright sourness or fruit flavors. M-The feel is slightly heavier than some lambic style beers with an assertive but smooth carbonation that really compliments the flavor. Perhaps the best ""feeling"" lambic I have ever had. O-What a great beer. It sounds stupid, but the smell and flavor are so simple and clean that the beer almost becomes more complex as I try to locate all the little subtle aromas and nuances that make this beer taste so good. Unlike some true Belgian lambics, I found this beer to be approachable, as well, i.e., not hugely sour or funky or hard to appreciate. The mouthfeel is also nearly perfect for the style."

1514,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.26,"Tarnished orange in color with a murky, hazy appearance. Poured with a tall, creamy white foam with very good retention. Herbal, earthy, dank hop aromas with a hint of over-ripe orange. Medium malty aroma. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Pleasant, creamy smooth feel with light richness followed by boozy warmth through the finish. Herbal, dank hop flavors with a solid malty backbone. Medium high, spicy hop bitterness through the middle that taper to pinr hop flavors and boozy heat. Finished with lingering pine hop bitterness and light, prickly boozy notes. Dank and bitter with a enough malt to balance the hop character and a pleasant booziness. "
1515,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.77,"Canned on: 08/09/19, picked up at the new brewery."
1516,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.5,"fresh can (7/21) drank on 7/27/17 pretty heavy DIPA but this is truly spectacular. A tropical bomb with slight bitterness. Complex and flavorful, drinkable too. Will seek future batches out as well"
1517,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.25,"Can. White head with lace. Hazy burnt golden orange.  This one is a bit sweeter compared to most OH hazies. Still soft and juicy. Peach yogurt. Mango and orange. Papaya. Very tropical, but not super juicy. Soft and creamy, but not bitter.  I have wanted to try this for a long time, but this one didn’t stack up to some of the other OH haze ipas."
1518,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.75,"2011 vintage, C&C 750ml. Teku glass. A: Pours crimson with a half finger of attractive, pink-tinted foam, receding moderately soon to a thick ring. Minimal lacing but very good retention. S: Gorgeous aroma of cherry, red wine, light funk, a bit of grassiness, and dry cinnamon toast. T: Cherry and funk meld well, with a light tartness building to more of a moderate sourness. A nice red wine character, with light oak in the background. Fairly dry. M: Medium body and medium light carbonation.  O: Phenomenal flavors and highly drinkable. The cherry is light but still noticeable, and the light to moderate tartness makes this highly drinkable and a good pairing with food. If only this were widely available, I could see drinking this all summer long."
1519,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.18,"Consumed 1/20/20 A: Pale tangerine orange with some yellow highlights - hazy - pours with a medium sized, white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves some nice lacing S: Lazy to write, but this really smells like Citra and Nelson - tangerine and orange juice, with some grapefruit and a spritz of lime - floral citrus - some herbal, green, leafy hops - tropical aromas and white grape, white wine - neutral, pale malt at the base T: Nice amount of citrus, with lots of floral notes and juicy flavors - tangerine, orange, grapefruit, ruby red grapefruit - touches of citrus zest, some lime - white grapes, white wine - leafy, herbal, green hops with just a small touch of pine and woodsy character - tropical flavors - low bitterness - pale malt base M: Medium body, smooth and slightly chewy, finish could be cleaner O: Because ""Perpetual IPA"" was already taken I dun goofed and should have tried this before Brighter Than Starlight. At the very least, I can confirm that this shares a lot with Brighter Than Starlight. Citra and Nelson seem to work pretty well together, although the white grape/white wine character that the Nelson is contributing to this beer could be a bit more balanced."
1520,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.5,"Was recently out in San Francisco visiting friends and had to get my hands on this legendary beer. Being a Boston guy, I am a bit biased to the NEIPA as the dominant IPA style, but this truly is the grandfather of the genre. Elder you might say. Anyways to the beer. It pours into a glowing gold with a frothy thick head that caught me off guard and escaped my glass. A casualty, but nonetheless we march on. Carbonation bubbles dance to the top of the head from the bottom of the glass. To the nose, piney/floral aromas tickle your nostrils. A sip and immediately you are met by a light bitterness, but a very fresh hoppy and pine like taste. A slight citrus aftertaste and each time you put it down, you are lured quickly to the next sip. Slowly you are warmed by the alcohol and once gone, you are left satisfied and disappointed you are out of beer. I'd compare it to tasting somewhat like a Harpoon IPA for my east coasters, but definitely a more impressive beer."
1521,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.01,"Bottled 1/12/2016. Pours a pale, hazy yellow with a tight white band around the shoulders. Nose expresses citrus, plum skins and a hint of spice. Not too much happening in the flavor department - must with a little citrus. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild carbonation and light acidity. Overall, solid; however, not much fruit is evident."
1522,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.7,"Bottle dated 1/10/19 poured into a DFH Signature Glass. Body is inky black with a quickly receding soapy head that left zero lacing. Aroma is bourbon, malts, coffee, and dark fruits. Taste is alcohol, cherries, chocolate, coffee, coconut, and vanilla. This beer gets more complex as it warms. Overall this isn’t better than Black Tuesday, but it’s still a world-class BBA Stout."
1523,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.28,"This one pours a syrupy and inky looking dark black color, with basically no head or lacing.  This smells like creamy and sweet toasted coconut, chocolate syrup, fudge, vanilla, and caramel. It’s called Coconut Vibes and sweet coconut is definitely the dominant vibe here - like a coconut cream truffle or something along those lines. It’s got a wonderfully lovely creamy flavor to it, with just a touch of roast and spice to prevent any impression of a cloying beer. There’s obviously a lot of coconut here, but it’s not overdone - too much of everything is just enough, as Bob Weir sometimes sings. I imagine the BA version of this is dynamite. This is thick, creamy and just slightly syrupy, with a lower and soft level of carbonation.  This series represents delicious beers that are maybe a touch easier to get the main Side Project stouts, and that’s something to be celebrated."
1524,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.65,"This is a landmark beer indeed. Big aged funk on the nose, yet so delicate on the palate. Slightly tannic, and a bit sherry-like (in a good way). One of the most balanced lambics I've ever had!"
1525,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.99,"Beast beer. Bought direct from brewery. Drank on 8/31 - canned on 8/31.  I love this beer. Just an explosion of balanced, hoppy goodness. Right up there there with Heady. I highly recommend road-tripping to Vermont to experience this IPA Mecca."
1526,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.62,"This is magnificent. As it warms, fresh peach aromas leap out of the glass. The Brett aroma is apparent but secondary. On the palate it is more balanced. Still wonderful, but a tad more peach would have been welcome."
1527,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.02,"Obsidian black with a starkly vibrant dark brown foam that's tall and pock marked, collapsing quickly to a thin ring. Nutty dark chocolate bar that's sharply sweet yet richly roasty is accented by floral tobacco that keeps it just shy of being cloying. A vanilla whip aroma emerges as it warms. The silky moderately light body finishes lightly sticky."
1528,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.27,"DATE: November 10, 2019... OCCASION: a good sports Sunday hopes to end with a Cavs win and the utmost Sunshine, courtesy of Brad... GLASSWARE: Lindemans stemmed tulip... this looks like the heart of a sun--a dense, opaque, brooding orange body, complete with white solar flares turning to coral lacing... a kerosene-like pine power, burning the nostrils with pineapple, grapefruit, and stone fruit.... leaf and dank basement also mingle, but this is born of a singular goal--to crush the tastebuds luponically... first sip bends the lips to its will, thick and buzzing with a near syrupy density... the weight requires this to be experienced in slow, thoughtful sips--this is somewhat crunchy, but the alcohol subtracts some of the welcoming punch of its other Sunshine iterations... warm start to finish, settling into a fruity cordial-like memory at the throat... the predominant flavor is grapefruit and pineapple, bold and juicy... flower petals, light herbs, and a stinging apple is its last trace... I might enjoy the Sip or Double a bit more, as both engage with this flavor but also drink at an more efficient pace... still, tough to throw darts at a beer this steeped in the hop and this succulent to the palate.... Brad, one more time--thanks!"
1529,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.68,"This beer is amazing.  Apparently, it is better on draft, but the version I had from the waxed bottle was fantastic.  A terrific mix of bourbon, oak, salt, toffee, and a highly carbonated second wave of sweet molasses flavor on the finish make this beer truly memorable.  This beer sits rivals BCBW '13 and Aaron b1 in their prime as the best in the style."
1530,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.75,"Probably best described as a black barley liqueur, the Black Tuesday brand doesn't need much tinkering, trying or adventure. Its a most utopian beer all on its own. But the marriage to rum barrels offers a kiss of even greater succulence and charm. And to think- most folks are simply happy that its not Monday anymore. Pouring the same abyss-black with an onyx sheen as the standard Tuesday, the stout also looks like an oil slick with a menacing purpose. As a dainty espresso crème mounts, the beer swirls with sticky legging of brandy proportions. Espresso, chocolate, coconut, vinous fruit and spiced rum fill the nose with opulence while a backbone of black-strap molasses, maple and bittersweet chocolate saturate the palate, seemingly of brownie batter in taste and consistency. The full brunt of flavor is known as the middle palate mounts, saturating each and every tastebud with extreme espresso, molasses, chocolate, walnut and hints of roasty smoke. Port wine, sweet rum, and madeira offer up a savory umami meatiness to balance the sweetness and add salinity. Its spicy finish is mildly tart with red wine yet smoothened with vanilla and heavy cream. Massively texture, chewy and silky- the lavish texture hinges on cloying, but its milkshake consistency wraps the tongue in its heavy coat and is patient to relax. The beer's extended flavor is indefinite and unyielding- warm with sweet booze, very much a digestive like fine liqueur."
1531,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.06,"This one was a slight disappointment, all honey, no coffee, maybe I should have drank it sooner but you figure a BA Porter would hold up with in 6 months of bottling. Not bad, but did not live up to its billing"
1532,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.79,"Tasted from bottle. Just a perfectly done BA stout. Pours black with beige head. Aroma of molasses, bourbon, caramel, maple. Thick and chewy. Moderately to heavily sweet. Flavor with lots of molasses and caramel, chocolate, bourbon. Excellent."
1533,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.99,"(2020 bottle) Appearance: Pitch black and oily in appearance, very thin mocha head on top. Tons of lacing on the sides after some swirling.  Aroma: Vanilla, chocolate, bourbon. Can't wait to dig in! Flavor: Incredible... In summary: vanilla fudge brownie soaked in bourbon. The balance is perfect -- soft bourbon touch throughout, deep rich chocolate, vanilla, raisins and dark fruits, and marshmallow. Not much alcohol detected. Palate/Finish: Very rich and velvety. Smooth. No burn. Finishes with more rich chocolate and bourbon.  Overall: Quite possibly one of the best stouts I've had. It reminds me of BCBS but with vanilla (haven't had the vanilla variant yet...). Incredible."
1534,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.4,Thanks to foundersasap for sending me this beauty in NBS BIF #9
1535,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.85,Poured from 375ml bottle dated 3/1/18
1536,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.7,"Poured from half-litre bottle into a ""snulip"" glass. This sample carried a bottle date of 8/11/20. Appearance of orange juice, with an opaque yellow body and a soap-sudsy white head that settled rather rapidly. Beautiful aroma, like popping open a bottle of mango-grapefruit juice while sitting by the Christmas tree. Lots of citrus and tropical fruit on the palate, along with quite a bit of dry bitterness. Crisp finish, with a hint of grapefruit lingering on the palate. Although this is a Citra hop bomb, the hop character may have started to fade a bit at six weeks past the bottling date. Nevertheless, still pretty tasty. Great pairing with hummus and pita chips, too."
1537,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.98,"This one was looked forward to with lots of excitement. Complex, yet super balanced, exceptionally great stouts from the masters of Saint Paul. You do want to taste this."
1538,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.27,"First beer from Bottle Logic. Pours a thick viscous deep brown/blackish color. Nice mocha head that fades after a minute or so. Glass lacing is there, as it should for a high ABV stout. Smell is sweet bourbon and dark roast coffee. Some vanilla, too, but definitely a bourbon presence. Taste is very bourbon forward, especially before it warms. It’s to the point even after it warms it’s a somewhat hot from the bourbon. I’m not getting much maple, but am getting lots of dark roast coffee. Also dark chocolate, so that aspect of the beer definitely shows. Some more faint vanilla and even a little dark fruit. Got a hint of caramel sweetness, too. Feel is right there with other bourbon beers. Overall, it’s good but I think it needs a year to mature. If I’m not getting much maple now, I don’t expect more to come forward. I’d rather see where this goes after some time in the cellar."
1539,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.63,"Kane absolutely nailed this one. Silky smooth porter with abundant maple syrup, cinnamon and roasted malt flavor. Best porter that I've had, bar none."
1540,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,5.0,"A summary of ""all"" of my FEB 2011 bottles that I've opened since ~2013: Bottle 1: Can see the potential, inferior to A&T."
1541,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.58,First time having OH not sure what took me so long! Such a great beer and I was blown away by it. Poured a hazy orange. Nice flavors of pineapple. Super dank and sweet.
1542,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.16,"Golden pout with a sweet scent of grapeseed and melon. Flavors were fruity with a slight vinegar-like tartness that was actually more gentle then what the initial taste inferred. Very drinkable. A rare purchase from Bottlecraft in SD, but one I was glad to make."
1543,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.54,Had on tap at HF and grabbed a 750 swing top growler as well. 
1544,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.56,So much coffee!! But doesn't taste like burn coffee grounds. Like a well balanced DDH....this is the same with coffee aromas and flavors. On the nose is like waking up at your favorite roastery.....but taste is mellow and warming like your own personal barista caring for this cold brew. FB is a top brewery for a reason
1545,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.37,"Poured a brown body with khaki head and lace sheath down the glass. Aroma comes across as containing mild candi sugar/caramel (toffee?) malts sweetness, figs, raisins, other dark fruits like prunes, bread, and some floral hops. Smooth, creamy, the yeast keeps it smooth while the caramel/toffee(?)/(other) malts keep it sweet, yet you get the dark fruits, mainly some raisins and figs, along with some bread for filling body and the beer has great balance. Great beer, worth the hype, another Belgian that it is hard for me to even qualify and I'm glad I got the chance to try this beer."
1546,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.53,"good heavens this is good. thanks to drlovemd87. he purged his cellar this week and i was the fortunate dumping ground. he may have mixed up, because this is insanely special beer, and i am very lucky to have tried it. cracked the bottle knowing nothing about it, but was quickly impressed with its every detail. neat frosted yellow color to it, good white head, creamy and rich, but soft and delicate too, dreamy and sexy, cool. smells awesome, slight tartness to it, but some of that is the hop tropicality going on, funky brett, very mature and dry, with a bit of pucker to it, maybe a hint of some souring cultures, but a lot more brett than bacteria from what i can gather. lots of hops too, juicy and tropical, southern hemisphere and heavy handed. i get some wheat in the malt base, belgian pils, maybe some oats too, it has that fluffy texture to it. the oak is impressive here, maybe a slight suggestion of white wine, but here i get vanilla and sweetness from wet fresh oak, not a barrel of any kind. tons of must and musk and funk from the brett, an old school belgian type i would guess, reminds me of some cool old world saisons in that way. lemony as can be, but also pineapple, lime, and passion fruit come into the fold with the hops. what i want to savor and remember about this thing though is the yeast, i want it forever on my palate, i want to copy it in my homebrew, and i want every brewery who attempts to make beer in this style to try it, because this is what its supposed to taste like. unsure ive had one ive liked this much. great carbonation, crackling dry, and with a very special mystique about it in general. i want to bathe in this stuff. my goodness."
1547,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.81,"Canned 3/25/21, drank straight from the can but poured a bit out to see the color.  Look: Pours opaque gold in the glass. Has aromas of grapefruit/mixed citrus with floral hops and some noticeable dankness.  Taste: Matches the nose of the beer. Has some breadiness but the malt is mostly overwhelmed by strong hops/pine and some nice tropical fruit up front. Lots of flavors in this one that blend together incredibly well, which is no small feat. Feel: Lingers on my tongue and finishes dryly with a classic bitterness on the back end. Very easy drinking, carbonation is moderate but not overwhelming.  Overall: Considered one of the very best of the style for a reason. A very drinkable and enjoyable beer, still holds its own incredibly well against newer NE IPAs."
1548,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.79,"Got a pour into a growler, so very very fresh. Pours a rich orange gold color, fully opaque with a two finger off-white head that leaves sporadic lacing Aroma is dense and pungent with tangy citrus notes. This is pretty intense and rockin' Taste is also very strong with up-front citrus hops that blast the tongue. The flavors turn into a more measured excellent citrus taste with a sweet base behind it. Bitterness is fairly weak. Feel is very soft and lightly sticky.  This is just a fantastic beer - not sure I can call it a Pale Ale with a 6.6% alcohol and such a full flavor. This is just an awesome variant on Fort Point which is already a great beer from Trillium. Really worth the high ratings."
1549,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.62,"Poured a non-translucent light purple color - almost like diluted grape juice. Very little head on presentation. The smell is tart, dry and vinous with a whiff of grape skins and oak. Some funk pushing through in the nose. The taste is so balanced and easy to drink. It's tart, dry (not as dry as many of their other fruit lambics), mildly sour with just a slight oak mustiness and notes of fresh grapes skins. While it is an overall dry lambic, there is some sweetness from the grapes that balances out the tartness. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel with just mild acidity, not too harsh. Overall, one of the better Cantillon's I've tried. It really stands out for being well balanced. While it used Merlot grapes, I wouldn't describe the beer having a taste resembling the qualities of Merlot (leathery and dark fruits), however this is a 2014 bottle and it may differ from a fresher version. It does have a nice vinous quality which I assume are from the Merlot grapes."
1550,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.54,"L: Auburn, dark brown hues with a minimal light sandy head"
1551,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,3.96,"375 mL bottle. Black body with no head. Smells of coconut and lots of chocolate. Some bourbon. Tastes really nice. Coconut is really strong. Bourbon behind it. Some chocolate. Hefty oak. Dry oak and booze, just like the vanilla variant. Boozy finish. Heavy with low carbonation. The coconut flavor just elevates it above the vanilla."
1552,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.53,"I received this from @bum4ever in an LIF box. Poured from 750 ml bottle into tulip glass. It pours a cloudy, golden-honey color with nearly a finger of foamy, eggshell-colored head and creamy lacing with long retention. The tiny bubbles ascend continuously. It's a lovely pour. It has a fragrant, sour aroma with lemon peel, banana, coriander, clove, and funky yeast. It's absolutely delicious with the sour fruit complimented by a touch of sweet banana and apple as the glass warms. The balance of sour, sweet, and spice is terrific and there is a touch of pepper at the finish. The mouth feel is wonderful: despite the lively carbonation it's remarkably creamy and viscous. Overall, this may be the best Saison I've had the pleasure to drink. The flavors are bold and the feel is as good as it gets. What a privilege to drink this wonderful beer!"
1553,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.57,"12 oz. Can. Canned 5/22/18 opened on 6/1/18 ss#6 Hazy lazy golden orange color, fat, all white foamy cover. Lots of lace on the misplaced liquid. Holds on strong. A seriously strong earthy orange and pineapple aroma pops right out of the hops. Sweet and tangy fruitiness, freshly cut grass and black pepper keep it going.  The flavor is deep hops man, earthy tones, tangy bitterness, wet earth, dry leaves, tangy pineapple and citrus notes all over the place. Very light malt, pilsner and crystal style bring forth a light, crisp but slightly honey sweet balance to the multiple layers of complexity in these hops.  It always amazes me how deep and fresh, juicy but earthy the hops are from the finest New England breweries. Just killin' it, ipa style.  The feel starts out light and crisp with a fresh, healthy bite, then becomes a bit lush and smooth, rounded edges which become a bite sharp from the dry, earthy bite right at the end. Very impressive. Just Mosiac really brings a serious amount of rainbow colored fruity hop patters, especially bold citrus and tropical pineapple."
1554,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.59,"I have been fortunate to get a wide variety of TH beers over the past five months and this is one of the best beers I have had of theirs. Smooth, and just plain tasty. Try it you will like it!"
1555,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.49,"Beautiful hazy golden color with thick, white lasting cap and excellent lacing. Aroma of citrus and sharp hops. The citrus strikes me as somewhat tropical while the hops have touches of pine and something like the floor of a mature forest. Flavor is a spectacular blend of citrus, hops and malt. I don't taste the malt so much as feel it's presence, but citrus and malt are on full display. This is a big beer in every sense, big flavors, big texture, 8% ABV, big aroma, big finish, yet it all comes together so harmoniously. Medium full texture with balancing carbonation. This is a World class beer worthy of any accolade I could put into words."
1556,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.96,"L: Pours thick and a deep dark brown, almost black"
1557,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.0,"Pours orange juice. 2 fingers of rocky foam dissipating in a couple sips leaving a nice trail. Smell is pineapple, melon, and other fruit with a very faint hop funk on the back. Taste is hop bitterness on the front followed by funk and then the fruit waves pour in. Tangerine, pineapple, and a tart grapefruit finish. Feel is creamy and thick. Good beer."
1558,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.22,"A 12 fl. oz. bottle, 2017 vintage. Poured into a Chimay goblet glass. Appearance: A cloudy murky dark brown colour with a thin beige head that dissipated quickly, but left some spotty lacing. Aroma: Sweet dark malt, toffee, caramel, dark fruit, plum, prunes, raisin, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and a splash of coconut. Taste: Moderately sweet, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, raisin, dates, prunes, brown sugar, oak, vanilla, coconut, with hints of bourbon, booze and cocoa on the finish. Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall: At times it felt a little on the sweet side, but the aroma and flavours are complex and enjoyable, and as a sipper, it was good."
1559,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.55,"Well, here is it: other than Emily Didonato lying at the foot of my bed - this is my number 1 want: Kern River Citra. As I sip I am jolted from a dream - is this real? Am I? First textures are lush and grassy like Warren Beatty trying to woo Natalie Wood. Unfortunately, what comes after it is not Disneyland every night at 9:30 PM - no fireworks. I’m missing that extra hoorah! I’m missing that extra zoom zoom in the boom boom! It’s nice and clean, but then like my 4th ex, it’s kind of one dimensional. It’s ok, but because of the hype going into it, I kind of haz a sad. *Ok, it’s known that Citra lost its luster over the years because of things, but now that Kern has it dialed in again, this one bangs like Woody Wood Pecker on Viagra. Yes!"
1560,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.5,"This is a great, old-school West Coast IPA with a strong malt backbone and a solid use of Citra hops. This was a game changer back in the day and still deserves its due respect."
1561,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.34,2016 vintage
1562,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,5.0,"This is hands down one of my favorite stouts. This and Old Rasputin would have to duke it out for top honors. There are few high production stouts that are this good, sorry Guinness."
1563,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.58,"Deep, dark brown body; huge dense and creamy light khaki head. Immense smell composed of maple syrup, molasses, caramel; a smidge of coffee. The taste amplifies the smell; maple syrup and caramel (again); very mild bourbon note; a touch of coffee bitterness; very sweet overall. Heavy body; thick and oily; lots of residual sugar heft. Despite the maple, bacon, and coffee adjuncts, the brown ale parentage is quite evident. Perhaps more like an English brown ale (low hop bitterness) / American brown ale (all the adjuncts) hybrid. Call it what you will, this is one amazingly complex and balanced barrel aged dark beers out there. ---- Late note (05/17/21) - bumped the taste up to 4.75 from 4.5 with my second bottle today..."
1564,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.35,"Poured out as a deep red color with a white head on top, the foam faded and just leave some bubbles around the edge of the glass. The smell of the beer smells a lot like what you'd expect from a traditional Kriek Lambic, musty earth and funky cherry on the nose. The taste follows the nose, good amount of cherry and acidic flavors in there. The feel is light bodied and clean, finished very dry. Overall and outstanding Lambic to say the least."
1565,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,5.0,"Pours motor oil dark and thick with no head whatsoever, just a thin mocha ring around the glass. On the nose, big bourbon aroma with a whiff of vanilla and ever so faint coconut. On the palate, big bourbon booziness right up front followed by dense sweet chocolate fudge and bitter espresso, finishing with faint vanilla and coconut. The mouthfeel is pure velvet, thick and oily with very little carbonation. Overall, this is a spectacular imperial stout!"
1566,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,5.0,I travel to Vermont .... you know for what. It's really good.
1567,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.19,Bottle from JohnnyHops. ~2 wks old. 
1568,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.37,"At one time ""hazy"" was an appearance. But thanks to breweries like Tree House, hazy in now a flavor, a feel, a beer experience. Ramping up their always popular Haze to imperial status, it looks like hazy days are here again.  Very Hazy pours with a matte visual texture of tarnish gold and taupe. As its creamy lather rises to greet the rim, a plethora of citrus, melon, tropical fruit and orchard fruit churns from the glass. Honey, poundcake and cereal come to mind as the ale's malty introductions are rich and cakey. But its bright fruit bouquet transitions to taste immediately with red grapefruit, tangerine, nectarine, pineapple, mango, passionfruit, lime, lemon and banana. Cantaloupe and a berry-like tanginess rounds out the fruitiness of the esters and hops while the persistent sweetness within coats the middle palate with layers of fructose, cake batter and honey. As the ale turns to take a bitter stride, the taste of fresh spruce shavings and sassafras weave attempt to balance the sweetness with a fresh grassy, herbal and tea-like dankness with a curious nod to cannabis. Full bodied and plush in a starchy cereal texture, the beer's imperial heft keeps the ale richer and fuller longer into the session to and resists much convincing to turn to dryness, bitterness or elevated crispness. What the palate gets in return is the fully malt balance that gives the hops a more rounded and more complex set of flavors. An aftertow of herb and citrus have a warm alcohol spice counterpart in a long cereal finish."
1569,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.45,"L: Hazy yellow with a slight orange tint. Nice fluffy white head and decent lacing. S: Peach, apricot, Ruby red grapefruit. A noticable malt aroma as well, clean and bready. T: Moderate bitterness, smooth, moves into juicy citrus and peach/apricot with some mango as well. The malt is clean and bready. F: Very soft and creamy while still managing to be dry and crisp. Perfection. Overall: A fantastic IPA that delivers on big juicy flavors and high drinkability. Definitely worth getting some if you get a chance."
1570,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.35,"On draft at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA. Holds head extremely long, with a lighter golden – yellow color underneath. Lovely fresh hit in nose, but with a surprising dryness. Smooth, balanced, and long, with good weight, which I don’t always get from Citra hops. Finishes with layers in depth, dry rather than sweet. Surprisingly elegant and rich without being heavy."
1571,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.79,"Hazy as all get out, and mango fruit punch for days - I've had a lot from Hoof Hearted, but this is by far their masterpiece. Good luck believing it's a Triple IPA too, because it drinks like a single! One of my new favorites."
1572,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.78,"Amazing Triple IPA! Definitely one of the best I've ever drank! I was able to try this from a pretty old can, and even still it was hazy and super delicious. Very lucky to drink an all-time great!!"
1573,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.44,Crisp and clean but with some floaters too! Nice tropical fruits up front give way to a solid bit of hoppy bitterness on the end. Refreshing and satisfying double here that doesnt taste like a double.
1574,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,3.83,"This is a review for the 2020 version that was dropped for a day. I am sure this will get great reviews as with everything Trillium but I think most good breweries brew better. Perhaps this ages better. Looks great. Dark, creamy, little head that dissipates soon enough. For an ""affogato"" it sets some expectations. Smells Good. Yes, you get the coffee, chocolate and vanilla but the smell gives you the first hint that this is going to be a disappointment. Stouts with lesser alcohol smell better and there are many good coffee and chocolate stouts out there.  First taste is really good. The smell has muted your expectations. The vanilla is there, the coffee not so much. I am guessing they do that to get a better audience but this is an ""affogato"" with a blend of coffee. There's more of chocolate notes so that's a plus. The aftertaste is too sugary though. By the second sip, a pint seems like a lot but I have been served at the brewery and the taste doesn't live up. Probably needs less alcohol with less sugar and more of a mouthfeel to get a better balance and flavor profile. I can see that this was a great beer when it was introduced a few years ago but it needs an update. The limited drop is a great way to get good ratings. Try this if you are in the Boston area. If you are making a trip, head to Wakefield in the opposite direction instead. Your local brewery probably makes a better pastry stout."
1575,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.78,Bottle Date: 2020
1576,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.56,"Growler fill dated February 2019 - very fresh. Beer doesn't appear to have settled at all - no floaties, no hop residue, no yeast. Lightly hazy in appearance, a bit gold around the edges, beautiful orange otherwise. Smells terrific - hoppy and citrusy. Taste notes include a bit of melon and lots of citrus. It's a very full taste experience that hits all over your tongue. Consistency isn't quite so thick as I'd expected, but it's certainly not thin.  Finish is ever so slightly dry and very clean. It's a terrific, refreshing drinking experience - I'd love to drink this beer all of the time. The ABV isn't very easy to discern - this could get quite dangerous. Fantastic beer. Thank you to nichols33 for the growler!"
1577,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.8,"Blend #4. This one pours a very thick-looking and murky dark brown, nearly black, with a very small head, and no lacing. This smells like caramel, leather, chocolate, oak, sherry, port, spice, maple, toffee, bourbon, and tobacco. This is truly excellent stuff. It's got a lot of barrel, and it's much drier and more nimble than some of the absolute saccharine beasts you get in this style. There's a dry toasted oak thing, and the bourbon comes across swinging leather belts across the face. There's some spice and vanilla from the barrel, too. The base is more caramel and toffee than some of that dark dried fruitiness you often get from the style, but I do get a kind of dry sweetness, almost like sherry or port - that honestly could be some pleasant oxidization. The beer was in barrels for two years, so it's very possible. This is medium bodied, creamy, and very rich and thick, with absolutely no booze character to it. This is 14%, and the booze is hidden just so well - it's a miracle in malt flexing. It's easy to see why this is so well-regarded. It's really one of the best barleywines I've ever had."
1578,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.81,So freaking good! Not as good as Bad Boy but the dry hop on this beer is so amazing. Has that cloudy ipa look that I love and it so smooth and drinkable. I wish I could have a tap of this straight from Alpine in my house.
1579,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,5.0,This is absolutely the most perfect barleywine that I have ever tasted. If it wasn’t so expensive I would probably drink nothing but this all winter. Barleywine is life!
1580,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.44,"A soured biere de champgne, well this is a first! Love both style, and this hybrid is a winner too. Nic champagne yeast and malt base with succulent sour grape, bright flowers, and dry white wine and oak finish. Goes from dry, to wet, to back to dry, with each switch unlocking new flavors. Smell has more of a musk and yeast center, but very spring like and pleasant. Touch of cumulative acidity and sneaky carbonation."
1581,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.6,"2020 version. I took this out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for thirty minutes before pouring.  L: Black, looks like coffee. Head disappears almost instantly. "
1582,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.58,"12 oz bottle poured into a teku glass. Pours dark deep brown/black. Khaki head falls off quick to a thin collar. Smell is coffee, cocoa, tobacco, oak, bourbon. Smell is deep and strong. Taste follows nose with vanilla, coffee, cocoa up front. Starts a bit bitter and roasty. The middle gets sweeter with the cocoa, some cream, and bourbon dominating. Finishes with tobacco and a bit of chocolate covered raisin. Feel is full, fairly carbonated, but with a soft creamy finish. Overall, this is a really nice beer. Good evening sipper. May try to get a few bottles more to age. It's deep, rich, flavorful, and highly enjoyable."
1583,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.58,"Had on tap. Poured charcoal black with a finger of brown foam. Smell captures the roast of the coffee beautifully, with dark chocolate, licorice, leather, and char supporting. Taste is not as coffee forward but still very much present, lots of malt with supporting flavors from the nose plus some vanilla and tobacco. Feel is chewy, creamy, heavy, and roasted. An amazing coffee stout"
1584,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.35,"750ml bottle, served in a snifter glass. Pour is medium dark brownish/black body, one finger light reddish/brown head, good retention and bits of lacing. Smell is heavily roasted coffee bean, sort of slightly burnt in a way, milk chocolate, cinnamon, a bit of green pepper and espresso. A bit weird at first, I think the coffee and cinnamon combined to make it smell a bit burnt. Flavour is much better though, not a ton of maple syrup but neither is it too sweet. Cinnamon lingers the background throughout, perhaps contributing a slight green pepper, black coffee and dark fruit, a fair bit of milk chocolate and caramel. Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and substantial, good carbonation and a smooth chocolate-forward finish. It kind of tastes like cinnamon sprinkled on chocolate frosting, in a good way."
1585,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.47,"2019 Vintage (""FOb5"") 500ml bottle - poured into a snifter at 45°F. Pours a pitch black oily sheen with a glug-glug-glug, forming an impressive ultra-dark brown head, that slowly recedes to a thick, bubbly tan collar, with i,pressure retention. Black and lifeless in the glass. She's a barrel-aged stout, alright.  Nose: As soon as the cap is popped, bourbon and vanilla waft out. Diving in, there's rich chocolate fudge, bourbon-soaked charred oak, and a fistfull of vanilla beans. The vanilla is intense, prominent, and extremely organic, but does not overwhelm the stout qualities and barrel. Caramel, toffee, vanilla fudge, chocolate fudge, malted milk balls, almond-coconut chocolate bar, brownie batter, vanilla cake frosting, white cake batter, and a vanilla intensity that starts to mimic cream cheese frosting. Some splintery white oak and dusty rackhouse notes thread through. As it warms, more chocolate, roast, and bourbon emerge. *Note* - this really opens up after several minutes and the beans cool off a lot, letting that stout and barrel emerge.  Palate: Fundamental Observation greets the palate with barrel-aged stouty goodness. Chocolate, fudge, brownie batter, some supremely balanced roast, oak, woody vanillin, malted milk balls, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, and barrel char, before the vanilla beans smoothly turn up the volume and come into focus. The vanilla is much more natural and properly integrated here, showing you that they're very much here, but that there's also stout and barrel sharing the field. Vanilla beans, vanilla frosting, vanilla cake batter, but blending nicely with the stout, giving it this vanilla-frosted chocolate brownie thing going on. No real dark fruit to speak of. Approaching the finish, each sip has this brief moment where everything is vanilla, and then everything becomes bourbon (actually closer to rye if I'm fussing), and then the chocolatey roast and malty notes enter back in. The finish itself highlights plenty of oak and bourbon, vanilla bean, cocoa, and roast, as the sweetness entirely disappears, allowing oak and roast to dry it out. A lengthy aftertaste of barrel and vanilla lingers on.  Mouthfeel/Body: This one is nicely thick, chewy, hefty, and viscous. It is NOT syrupy, cloying, or ridiculous. There's some light effervescence underneath, and it finds that balance between big, thick, and chewy, without getting in the way or becoming overbearing. Coats the lips some, but that barrel really dries out and cleans up the finish. Some warmth going down, but never hot.  Overall: Vanilla stouts are hard. I adore a great one, but great ones are hard to come by. BCBS Vanilla was a great one. I'll need to compare, but this is easily up there. BCBSV had more vanilla (maybe too much), and way more dark fruit, with less oak, and less body. This finds more balance, more stouty character, more fudge, oak, and bourbon, and a better body. It's a fantastic display of vanilla, and definitely one worth trying. I think there could be better vanilla stouts out there, but for what it is, this 2019 is definitely enjoyable."
1586,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.84,"Displaying a unique color of lightly foggy pale orange or even crayon peach, a moderately dense white blanket settles down to a curled, quietly active ring. The nose has faint, mildly dusty oak pairing with a pleasantly subtle floral perfume that's just hypnotizing. Uniquely and cleanly juicy, a lightly herbal, drupe-influenced sort of pear character with just a kiss of tartness is dreamily weaved throughout the zippy effervescence of its satisfyingly palate massaging medium-light body before coming to a vanishing semi-dry swallow. Flora Plum is such a perfectly quaffable yet delicately complex brew, it's beyond words. I love being floored by subtly delicate complexity like this. The experience is pure, even without a discernible Hill expression. It seems to even transcend that already high bar."
1587,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.4,"Tar black with a dark mocha fizz that disappears quickly leaving a slick, taut black surface. The aroma is super creamy and fudgey dark chocolate brownie with vanilla bean and mocha, while a fine bourbon oak is smoothly present, yet not overpowering. Amazing flavors of deep dark chocolate brownie somehow don't come across as too sweet, as rich vanilla accents a very nicely complex charred oak that's simultaneously woody, herbal and spicy. Cocoa dusted prune comes out in the swallow as follow-up sip enhances the dark coffee and measured bourbon presence. The medium body is slick with a finely crisp but quick to die fizz that finishes semi-dry, tingly, and a little sticky. This is certainly deserving of the hype--the rare instance of bourbon barrel aging that creates a massive improvement over its base. 2018 vintage"

1589,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.2,"Drinking from a 16oz can into glass. I have a hunch that perhaps this can has been sitting around for a while as the aroma and taste is very muted and borderline stale (dare I say). Even still its a tasty big beer, with a surprisingly thin body for 11.5%. Not top shelf worthy, at least not the can I drank from."
1590,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.44,"L - 2-finger hazelnut head atop a pitch black body. S - coconut from across the room. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate. T - follows the nose.

F - a tad below medium-full body with ample carb. O - liquid mounds bar."
1591,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.71,"Aromas of caramel, toffee and chocolate. The taste of milk chocolate with a hint of roast hits your tongue and lingers to the finish. The mouthfeel is fluffy. Overall terrific unpastried BA stout."
1592,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.17,"Appearance: the body is a cross between baby yellow and tan. Totally opaque with haze with a 1-finger white head with good retention. Aroma: super hoppy, but there this is an off aroma of ammonia and Windex. Flavor: sticky lupulin that overpowers any other flavors that the hops might yield. There are no standout distinctive flavors to speak of – really just generically hoppy. There malt base is a very good start point; I’d try this beer repeatedly using different hop combinations.  Mouthfeel: medium-medium. Appropriate for style, but nothing to write home about. Overall: the hype precedes this beer. It is good, but no beer than many unhyped NE IPAs readily available in my market (Denver). Overall, I’m not tremendously impressed."

1595,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.42,"2018 vintage, 12 oz bottle pours a very dark brown, with tan colored head. decent head retention for a barrel aged beer. nice complex aroma of vanilla, mild caramel, a bit of raisin, tobacco, chocolate, a touch boozy. similar flavor, slightly sweet, really nice as it warms up. medium bodied."
1596,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.85,"this is so extremely floral, feel like you're chewing some flowers. it is one of a kind, I never find anything that's like it. very sweet but you don't feel it's overpowering, on the other hand, you still able to taste all the other complex flavors. alcohol nicely hidden. a beer that I'll definitely miss."
1597,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,3.52,"Nice oaky chardonnay aroma, but far too acetic in the taste. And while it raised a nice head, in doing so it seemed to lose most of it's carbonation leaving the beer somewhat flat by the time of drinking."
1598,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.23,"Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color ale with a large foamy head. Aroma of funky Brett notes with some tartness, oak and light acidity notes also perceptible. Taste is a mix of funky Brett notes, oak, tart notes with subtle acidic notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Interesting saison with right amount of complexity."
1599,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.24,Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a large tulip glass.
1600,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,3.55,"Look – The cork popped nicely on this. Pours a dirty raspberry color with a nice thick pinkish red head and lots of lacing. Smell – Sour cherries, raspberries, grassy funk, oak, and a hint of sweetness. Taste – Sour cherries seem to dominate the taste. I didn’t taste any of the sweetness I detected from the nose. Also a slight hint of vinegar. Feel – A bit too tart for my liking, with a lingering sour aftertaste. Nicely carbonated. Overall – I think it is a bit too tart to be super drinkable for my palette."
1601,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.86,"I'm not particularly a fan of barleywines or Straightjacket for that matter, but I got to try this at a share recently and I fully understand why it is a favorite and top-rated beer!!! Absolutely amazingly smooth. I wouldn't change a thing about this. Outstanding! I will search this one out in the future for sure"
1602,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.05,"An angry void of black is capped by a thin but solidly uniform tan blanket that dies to an oily tar black surface. The medium-full body starts with floral vanilla which then becomes simultaneously more viscous yet hot as the bubbly froth develops a fiery breath that's hot af. That said, it has a good, woody bourbon character that's mature and not overpowering, but it's just the ABV that is pretty intense."
1603,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.7,"The best coffee stout I’ve ever had. Drank back to back with 2019 Abraxas, the depth the roasty, rich, bitter coffee adds is incredible. Coffee, chocolate, milky, cinnamon, light heat from the chilis, this is really something special. So smooth."
1604,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,3.43,"Updated with 2019 bottle, where I had a much more realistic pour. I do not believe that one vintage was significantly better than the other. I think my opinion was tainted by hype and my own naivete back in 2014. 12 oz. bottle. Black, thin collar. Smells of hefty vanilla, nutty malt, a bit of whiskey. Tastes of vanilla throughout. Sweet fudge, sweet malt, and a little bit nutty. Oak and a bit of whiskey. Very sweet, very sluggish. Like the coconut variant, it's not standout. Very sweet with a veiled barrel character. 2013 bottle: 4-4.25-4.25-4.5-4.25"
1605,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.03,"Appearance: Arrives clear and golden colored with a one finger cap; dots of lacing Smell: Big malt and hip aromatics with overripe pineapple and caramel driving the malt and and dank pithy pomelo on the hops Taste: As with the aroma the malt and hops battle it out with the tropical fruit merging into dank tones; old school bitterness, through the middle with a boozy but dry finish Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation; plenty of warmth in the gullet Overall: Haven’t had an IPA like this in a long while; a real palate challenge"
1606,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.47,"2020 release, 13.7%. Thanks, Brian ! Jet black with no head, this looks decent. The nose is decadent. Tons of vanilla and coconut are layered on top of rich, bitter dark chocolate. Toasted coconut, rich, floral, fruity vanilla are present, complementing the coconut and vanilla notes from the bourbon barrel. The adjunct and barrel character is massive, almost overpowering the base beer, but some dark chocolate and bitterness are able to power through. The palate opens boozy and brash, with tons of coconut and vanilla, almost macaroon like. Dark chocolate, creamy, mildly bitter upon which coconut, bourbon and vanilla are layered. A ganache like creamy feel and flavor are present. Dark fruit flavors with raisin and some dried cherry flavor. Boozy, a little hot on the finish. Fully in body and softly carbonated, flavors of vanilla, bourbon, coconut and chocolate linger in the finish. Unabashedly hedonistic , this isn't particularly deep or complex but is really well done. I do wish this had more of a rich, dark chocolate, though."
1607,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.33,"Looks and smells gorgeous. Lots of citrus and tropical flavors on the nose. The mouthfeel is also good though the taste flavors are more on the grapefruit than citrus side. Personally, I liked it because it does make for a more balanced and complex beer.  I was happy to have this over sunset at a brewery. It just lacked something to make it a memorable beer. The dry hopping with Galaxy was pretty good but could be better. You could tell that the base beer (Fort Point) was awesome and saved the day."
1608,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,3.94,Received from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF 10 – Thanks Derek! Reviewed 1/26/20.
1609,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.49,"Pours pitch black with minimal head. Caramel, cinnamon vanilla and barrel on the nose. Taste covers all of the aromas with some licorice coming through. Great mouthfeel and just the right amount of carb for the brew. Overall great one from Fremont."
1610,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,"I have now had 4 different years of KBBS and continue to feel this beer is in a realm of its own. The look is as dark as burnt motor oil. The smell is filled with maple, coffee, bourbon, and stout. Outside of 2020 the taste is super sticky with a huge mouth feel.  I would say I rate 2018 as being the best year followed by 2019, then 2018, and I would rate 2020 last."
1611,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.43,"Turbid orange color with a sizzling sudsy off-white head after an aggressive pour, this gorgeous Belgian Gueuze (l love typing “Gueuze” - sue me) has the obligatory funky Brett aromas ubiquitous to the style, and I’m a bit surprised to find a citrus note, specifically, oranges.  The taste is ..... raw, if that makes sense. It has funky Brett flavors mixed with the aforementioned oranges, and there’s a saltiness which works well, but there’s also an acidity that I think would fade as this ages. It still tastes excellent, but I’ll bet in 10 years, this would be amazeballs. The mouthfeel is amazeballs now, very sprite and dry, almost like a champagne. Truly spectacular. I only wish I had a second one to age for 5-10 years to see how this would evolve."
1612,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,2018 version poured into a tulip. This beer deserves every bit of hype associated with it in my opinion. Wonderfully thick. Marshmallow and chocolate delight with booze knocking on the door. I hope I have another chance to try this beer sometime.
1613,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.59,"Appearance - The beer poured an oily black color with a tan colored head and lacing left behind. Smell - to put it simply, it smells like cinnamon toast. They were definite bread notes.  Taste - This tasted like cinnamon toast. They were definite bready notes with spice with just a touch of maple sweetness. The cinnamon was nicely balanced and not oppressive. In the back, it leaned more towards bitter coffee as the sweetness faded. Mouthfeel - Being a porter, it was a little less clingy than a stout with less tendency to coat the mouth. It was still able to linger for a while b Overall - This was great. It was not as heavy as a dessert stout."
1614,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.56,"One of the prettiest beers I have seen in a while, this pours a hazy orange juice color with a nice two fingers of head. Head lasts a while before breaking leaving generous lacing.  Smell is really quite tropical and fruity. I'm getting a sweet citrus and melon dominance with a touch of a pith or pine in there too.  Taste is a follow-through of the nose, with the sweet juicy tropicals coming through strong. It seems kind of a hoppy fruit juice. Bitterness of pith and pine on the back end. Feel is creamy and smooth as all get out. Carbonation is spot on, and the finish brings a dry earthy bitterness that lasts and lasts.  I am going to say that I am lucky to have had this beer. And to be honest, it's a couple of months old and still fantastic. I know if I had regular access to this, I'd have a fridge full."
1615,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.71,"It's the Port wine of the beer world, well sort of. It drinks more like a liquor than a beer, no carbonation, no creamy head just a viscous high alcohol punch in the sinuses. It's a great beer to experience if you can get enough folks to split the cost because this bottle ain't cheap."
1616,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,3.95,"Look: Pitch black. One finger of tan head that quickly dissipates. Smell: Sweet dough, chocolate, honey. Taste: Sweet & sour dough and honey. There's a definite mild savory and sour note. Some bourbon flavor. Mouthfeel: Average body, good carbonation. Overall: The taste of this bottle is somewhat unusual. As I said, it's not really ""bitter"" per se. It almost seems to try and balance the sweetness with a sour note like you would get in sweet & sour Chinese food. I'm not sure if I really like that."
1617,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.59,"Canned 11/23/20 and enjoyed on 12/02/20. Pours with some moderate effervescence with some moderate head retention and lacing. Color reminiscent of orange juice. Complex scents of pine, mango, pineapple, fresh cut grass. Similar flavor profile- lots of tropical fruits, orange zest, with some noticeable hop bite. Soft, fluffy mouthfeel. Nice oily bitterness that lingers on the palate. I really enjoy galaxy hopped beers and this is a solid one that drinks bigger than it is, more like a DIPA. Really big and bold flavors."
1618,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.5,"Pours black with a thick tan head with nice lacing. Tastes of heavy malt and coffee mixed with dark chocolate, fudge and syrup. A definite barrel influence is found and has nice viscous mouthfeel. Nice."
1619,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.2,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/27/2017. Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Mild increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roast/char bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of nutty coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, dark bread, coconut, marshmallow, light licorice/molasses/dark fruit, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Lightly increasing warmth of 19.9%, with mild lingering barrel booziness after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. Bruery stouts always seem to have a class of their own on the flavor profile. Not as deeply roasty or charred on black/roasted malts like some others; but still extremely rich and complex. Outstanding barrel integration and balance; without feeling overly boozy, tannic, or drying. Very similar to the base beer with big levels of fruity/nutty coffee complexity. A highly enjoyable offering."
1620,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,3.87,"Little thin, lacking the thicc sweetness of the past, cinna-forward with some nice malty RIS flavors (fig, raisin). Glad to tick it but wouldn’t seek out again. Not at all the rating that would constitute a top 20 beer"
1621,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.43,"Pours black with a finger and a half of dense caramel foam. Aroma is maple, syrup, chocolate, fudge, cocoa nibs, toffee, and toasty, toasty malts. Big time and expressive. No booze on the nose. Flavor profile is more of the same - chocolate, fudge, toffee, maple, nuts, and roasty and toasty malts. Booze seeps thru a little more here, offering up a touch of heat at the end. That heat couples up well with char to round out the sweet start. Mouth feel is thick with hearty, velvety texture. Overall, everything from the first look to the texture is great. It's boozy and big without being abusive or mislead.  Draft. Reviewed on phone."
1622,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.41,"I finally got this up in Vermont this summer. I was expecting too much from it based on other people's ratings. I actually prefer SOS to the double. Don't get me wrong, this is a great DIPA, but I am getting bitter taste from the hops rather than the sweet taste I get from SOS. I love how this beer is clear, amber from the delicious malt, well-carbonated, and easy to drink."
1623,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.63,"A: Pours a light straw color, soda-like fizz, with almost no head.  S: A big, earthy/horseblanket brett, pie-like sugary lemon, nectarine, peach, and a little lactic tartness. The brett is fairly dominant.  T: Nice mix of white wine, nectarine, peach, a bit of lemon, moderate earthy funk (toned down a bit from the nose), with medium-light tartness. The wine is prominent and adds a sweet roundness which cuts the tart and adds a really nice dimension. Shortish finish. M: Light bodied, effervescent, with medium-high carbonation. O: Really exceptional and refreshing. Nice blend of brett, citrus fruit, and wine, with light tartness which doesn’t limit drinkability. The taste is better balanced than the brett-dominant (but still appealing) nose."
1624,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.28,Drank the 2012 bottle...Not sure how this one has not fallen off the BA Top 250 list. It was a solid BA Stout but I have had dozens of BA stouts that were better than this one. I recently had the Pappy Eclipse and it was better than this one. Shared with friends recently at a small share. Who knows...maybe the 2012 sat too long
1625,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,5.0,"A wild ale's wild Ale. De Garde nailed it on this one. Appearance is a hazy opaque golden orange peach color, absolutely beautiful! This was B1 so the nose was in the face cognac from the moment the bottle was capped ... oh them barrels!! Flavor is big peach, with nice integrated Brandy tones, and the mouthfeel is as rich as a wild Ale can get. Home run with B1 de Garde!"
1626,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,16oz. can poured into a beer can shaped glass. A bit of citrus with some pine finish. Dank. Very glad to try this but this seems to fall ever so slightly short of reputation.
1627,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.68,"pours Hazy gold,nice 1 inch white head,great lacing"
1628,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.27,"12oz can purchased at the brewery. Pours a hazy dirty orange with an inch of head. Moderate amount of lacing. Lots of citra hops in the nose. Orange, lemon, grapefruit and some sweet fruity candy. The taste is more of the citra. Orange, tangerine, grapefruit along with some mango and pineapple. Orange, lemon and peach finish. Some alcohol heat. Medium body with a dry mouthfeel."
1629,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.67,"Very similar to Smooth.  Differences  Light color from the white peaches  Nose is more delicate. Definite peach aroma.  Taste follows the Bose. More delicate flavor that allows the base beer to be more cohesive with the peaches instead of a punch of nectarines. Also slightly more acidic Feel is also more delicate  Overall, this is a more delicate, better balanced beer than smooth. If you like a more fruit forward beer, smooth is where it is at. However the nuance of fuzzy is fantastic. You get more of the base beer, and more of that great Missouri micro Flora."
1630,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.53,"Mother of god this one was tasty. At first I thought I had a ""regular"" Trillium Congress Street, then realized I'd somehow scored the DDH version (found it online). Canned date 8/9/19 so I made sure to try this one fresh. And it knocked my socks off! Loved the look - reminded me of some of the best Tree House offerings. Very hazy yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and thick sheets and rings of lingering lacing that clung to the glass and did not fade away. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, mango, papaya, tangerine, passionfruit and guava; also malt, caramel, creamy vanilla and some weaker floral hops. Some dankness in the background. Taste follows the nose, great balance between the slightly bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Extremely juicy. At first I was going to give the smell/taste ratings of 4/4.25 since they were surprisingly muted and I was disappointed. But then as the beer warmed a little the second glass was incredible, more pungent and flavorful and complex with more depth. This is what I was looking for! Mouthfeel was incredible, soft, pillowy, luscious, sticky, smooth, coated the palate. Perfect amount of carbonation. Just an outstanding beer and I am lucky to have acquired other Trillium beers to try."
1631,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.58,"L: Hazy yellow with hints of orange, creamy white head and good lacing. S: At first right after I poured, fairly subdued. But after I took a few sips the aroma opened up to reveal dank pine, juicy citrus, mango, and peachy esters. The malt is very subdued, but contributes a bready background. T: Very mild bitterness upfront, instant waves of juicy mango, orange, pine resin, and peach. Very complex hop flavor for a single hop beer. The malt provides a bready base with a touch of sweetness that just balances out the bitterness. F: Very creamy, dry. Overall: A beer that took a second to get going for me, but by the end of the glass was savoring every last sniff and sip! Such a wonderful showcase of the citra hop and whatever glorious yeast strain Hill Farmstead is using."
1632,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.48,"1/21/2015, shared with rudzud. No real head, very dark almost black dark brown color, little legs. Nose big malt, sweet candy little syrupy, toffee caramel thing, roasted coffee syrup, toasted coffee beans, nice fudgey chocolate brownie, little nougat, big toasted walnut or chestnut, mild bourbon and vanilla barrel.  Taste brings nice vanilla oak, toasted oak with nice sweaty bourbon, vanilla nougat candy, sweet milk dud, juicy barrel juice, tons of caramel candy, caramel creams, little roasted coffee, big candied fig and date, Charleston chew mixed with rolo candy, faint booze, nutty toasted walnut, sticky candy but quite tasty. Then all caramel bOurbon and cocoa late. Finish mild sticky no booze, plenty more bourbon caramel and chocolate candies. Mouth is med to a little fuller bod, lighter carb, light booze. Overall awesome but missing a bit of the barleywine aspect."
1633,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.49,"Sweet hell. Like Karl Malone in the 4th quarter, this one delivers. Think of your darkest moment, think of your darkest fantasy, think of your darkest memory... and then bottle that in a 12 ouncer and Plead the 5th Barrel Aged is what you have. The most beautiful, the most visceral, the most wild moment of your life... Think and dream. And in this beverage, I do."
1634,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.19,"Pours a golden hazy orange with a two finger head, quickly dissipating. Smells of peppery hops, stone, earthy, with citrus. Taste is a bitter bite into tropical fruit, juicy and sharp. Lingering bitterness on the end, little bit of booze burn. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy. Not getting much of the honey. This is likely my favorite of the cutting tiles hop varieties. Good beer."
1635,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.6,"2018 vintage, tasted on 2021.1.11"
1636,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.43,"In review is a 2012 Vintage. A - Pitch black pour with moderate toffee lacing, lots of legs on the sides of the glass, sticky lacing, little to no carbonation. S - Roasted chocolate malt, a hint of charcoal on the nose, bourbon, and a little bit of oak. The overall nose is extremely mellow (probably because of the age of the bottle). T - Lots of roasty cocoa from start to finish, oak woodiness, delicate bourbon that's not overpowering in any way at all - perfectly blended, some small hits of black licorice, and ends with a mellow lingering roasted cocoa with light char, bourbon, and some black licorice on the very back end. No heat whatsoever on the way down M - Full bodied with a silky/velvety feel on the tongue, lip smacking sticky on the lips. O - This 2012 bottle is spectacularly impressive."
1637,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.41,"16oz can, dated 11.27.19, poured into a Tree House snifter glass. The beer pours a deep jet black color, very thick and viscous with a finger or so of caramel colored head that has modest retention and yields a spot or two of lacing. The aroma is excellent, rich chocolate, fudge, brownie batter, chocolate syrup, smooth coffee roast, a bit of sweet cream, vanilla and rich dark grains. The flavors are great, bursting with rich chocolate, lots of fudge, brownie batter and tons of chocolate syrup while there is great layer of smooth but roasted coffee underneath that plays well with the toasted grains and compliments the sweet cream and vanilla aspects of the beer. The mouthfeel is incredible, super luscious with a thick and heavy body that coats extremely well and is so smooth with a creamy finish. Verdict: A stunning stout from Tree House. The flavor profile feels like that of a 10%+ ABV beer, it's bursting with chocolate and the mouthfeel is so incredible for a beer this size and the layers of coffee and cream round this one out for a very sweet and rich dessert style beer."
1638,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.16,"Right up front I will say that I am not a huge fan of sour beers. I find them a bit bracing and not the kind of beer I enjoy drinking. Having said that, I do find them an interesting category and this one, while a bit puckering, was not as sour as some of the sour beers I've tried. It has almost a champagne shandy type of mouthfeel/taste. It's light and crisp the way a champagne is and has a similar carbonated consistency. The color is nice with a dark yellow color and little bubbles which fizz within it. The taste is a very fermented peach flavor. Tart and acidic but not so much so that you lose the nuances of the apricot/peach. I did something I never do with a sour and had a glass and a half of this in one sitting. Probably more to do with the price and scarcity than the taste. As rare as this is, I probably won't get another chance to try it ... and I am actually quite okay with that. This is a conversation beer ... someone who enjoys sour beers might argue differently ... but as a sour skeptic, I can appreciate the time (up to two years) aging this and know that the French do not mess around when it comes to great beer and wine production. This is no doubt of the highest quality you can buy. The only issue I had is that, for the price and rarity, the bottle looks very cheap. It reminds me of a bottle of sparkling apple cider you'd buy at the store for $3."
1639,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,"Had on tap at the Trillium Garden on the Greenway a month or so back. Super hazy and golden color. Huge flavors of peach, citrus rind, honey, and resin attack the palate. It's very chewy and sticky in the mouth, a bit heavy in the stomach but still so very drinkable due to the flavor. This beer is incredible and the blend of wildflower honey with Galaxy was near perfect."

1641,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.52,"Wow, beautiful pour!! And nice sticky persistent bold fuscia head. Dragon and passion fruit infiltrate your passages on this one, but done in a way that sticks to the category, awesome! Must try!!"
1642,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.73,"Thanks to CTJman for answering my plea a while back; I’ve been looking forward to this one & since I don’t have to wake up tomorrow (I mean I will eventually, I hope) it’s time. Black-waxed 750ML bottle split with my wife.  The wax isn’t too bad & the beer pops loudly upon release, foreshadowing lively, but short-lived, visible carbonation, though it keeps audibly crackling for a while. The nose is dominated by rum & sweet corn syrup, & while there are probably subtleties, they aren’t easy to spot under that onslaught.  Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel Aged is a decadent, rum-soaked, Caribbean, sun-splashed treat. Rum lights up the palate over a base of enough malts to denude multiple acres. Powdered sugar soaked in sugar water & drizzled with brown sugar, rich toffee, syringe of alcohol to the brain stem, light spiciness (from the rum I presume, & the only light thing about this monster), vanilla, high quality maple syrup. Did I mention the alcohol? Or sweetness? Full, thick, oozing. I’m going be enjoying this half-bomber for a long while, & I’d be happy to have had the other half, too.  I love alcohol, sweetness, & rotting my teeth, so why wouldn’t I love this? I do. This is in the upper echelon of barrel-aged stouts & the best of the variants I’ve had to date. Absolutely stunning."
1643,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.29,"Having this (season 18|19 blend 92) side-by-side with regular Oude Geuze (season 18|19 blend 69), for maximum contrast, Zenne is a much darker amber, with a short khaki head that settles to a thin off-white ring. The nose is nougat and nutty dusty musty walnut to the nth degree. Taste exhibits sweet honey and caramel characteristics, and upon intermingling with the sherry barrels, this emulates a caramel apple and even mulled cider, all while maintaining starkly savory notes attributed to the barrel. This puppy is dry af, and also a bit more acidic than OG, yet simultaneously more complex, especially as it warms. Even still, it maintains in the background those classic toasted cracker and grapefruity 3F properties. As mentioned, the contrast between regular OG and this is astounding. While the Oude Geuze is simply more drinkable, effervescent, and lightly brightly clean, I can see how a brew like this stands out from the crowd and makes a very uniquely intriguing impression. At the same time, I can't imagine solo doming a whole bottle of this, it's just so complex. Sharing is the move here."
1644,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.58,"I have never really been a fan of the apple brandy BA stouts. The apple character has always been an odd mix for me. I got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because I love Prairie and I knew people flip for this beer. Upon opening it, the smell is very distinct and I just don't like it! It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too. A great beer that changed my mind. I've never had a beer with a smell that I didn't like end up being enjoyable before, so a really fun beer."
1645,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.5,"Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip L: Super hazed juice bomb our. Big fluffy white head leaves great lacing. S: Citra hops. Fruity/tropical and citrus. T.F: Light grains up front. Sweet... lush tropical fruits with mango, orange juice, and grapefruit. Lighter pineapple and tangerine. Creamy and smooth... medium bodied and sticky on the tongue. More fruit at the finish. O: An outstanding NEIPA. One to seek out."
1646,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.5,"Pours a golden copper color, nearly clear, with a finger’s worth of sudsy off-white head that dissipates in seconds. This beer literally glows. The nose is tart and funky, with white grape and barely ripe Granny Smith apple aromas. Wow. I believe this is gonna be a “puckerer” of a Gueuze. There is some pucker on the taste, but not nearly as much as I thought would be present. I get the white grape and green apple flavors, and it is indeed very tart and funky, but there’s a tannin-like quality to this - it’s very acidic, almost like champagne (without all the bubbly), and there’s a little salt as well. The mouthfeel is very dry, which I expected. What I did not expect is the aftertaste - this tastes like a beer in the way back of my palate. Magnificent. This is my first Cantillon, and I see what all the hype is about. Truly world-class, IMHO."
1647,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.5,On tap at the source. 2018 edition.
1648,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.75,"Had '14 and '03 750ml, '08 and ' 12 375ml and '04 Magnum on 10/7/2017 at Drie. '08 was the best, followed by '04, then '03, '14 and '12 was last although it was a great beer"
1649,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.43,"Absolutely fantastic NE style IPA. I’m coming to love this brewery. Canned date 10/16/19 so this was incredibly fresh. Pours a luscious yellow hazy color with great fluffy white head and nice rings of lingering lacing that cling nicely. Smells of ripe tropical fruity hops - tangerine, grapefruit, mango, guava, pineapple, lemon, papaya. Also malt, creamy vanilla, bread and a little floral and herbal hops. Taste follows the nose, very juicy and balanced and great depth. Higher ABV was very well-hidden. Smooth, sticky, luscious, soft mouthfeel that coated the palate and perfect amount of carbonation. An outstanding beer."
1650,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.44,"Mixed opinion. Have been waiting to try this for years. Bought 3 and will try out over at least 9 Years. Beer #1: Beer had outstanding nose and flavor, and is easily considered an excellent beer. Appearance was fine and head/lacing consistent with an almost 20% ABV. Very disappointed in mouthfeel... had expected something full and rich and instead a bit hot (understand), very thin (don’t understand) and even a touch astringent. Hard to believe it’s a Double IS. Almost a mix of Black Tuesday, Vanilla, nibs... and Sang Noir."
1651,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.66,750mL bottle into a snifter
1652,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.47,"Poured into a tulip glass. A clear ruby red color with a fleeting pinkish head. Scant wispy laces in the glass. Aroma had rich oak barrel, vanilla, blackberries, cherries, currants, and funk. Fairly tart on the first sip and with the bright fruity notes above. Lemony on the finish. Complex and all the elements shined. Delicious."
1653,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.45,"2015. 18.4% ABV. Like with all the other Weekday pours, a dark brown color with crimson hues. Small amounts of ivory head that dissipates quickly and settles into the beer.  Dark fruit and booze right away on the nose, with hints of roasty coffee and vanilla. Lots of potent ethanol, with those expected notes of oak and char from the Black Tuesday's sweet, smooth base character. Although there's that high gravity potency, even after 3 years of bottle conditioning, both adjuncts are still very much present. The vanilla and chocolate have held up so well in the flavors. If you have a bottle of this from 2015, now is the time to open it. Predominantly sweet, with complimentary hints of dark fruit and subtle roasty coffee. Balanced, smooth flavors. Baker’s chocolate bitterness contrasts a sweet vanilla bean finish.  Smooth and the softest mouthfeel of all the other Weekday variants. Warm, boozy, with low carbonation that is still present but not at all distracting."
1654,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.3,"12oz can. Pours a cloudy pale dirty orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Big nose of tropical fruits. Pineapple, guava, mango, lime and grapefruit. The taste is pineapple, lime, grapefruit and peach. A bit more citrus bitterness towards the end. Spicy/herbal hop finish. Malts come out at the end. Dry mouthfeel with a medium body. Mild alcohol presence, but I wouldn’t have expected it to be as high as 8%."
1655,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.34,"Minimal carbonation. Smell is hot with tons of alcohol and rum aromas. Taste follows suit with rum, chocolate and dark fruit. 3 years doesn't appear to have tamed the heat at all, or if it has I can't imagine what this was like fresh. Still delicious but the regular bourbon version is definitely better."
1656,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.86,"Tasted from bottle. Pours a hazy orange with nice head. Fruity aroma with citrus notes. Flavors of apricot, orange and some sour funk. Crisp and easily crushable. Not overly sour. Incredible."
1657,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.09,"From a 16 oz. can dated 06/07/2021. Sampled July 3, 2021. Murky, hazy looking pale yellow underneath a boisterous white head. The aroma emits citrus, tropical notes, white bread, something herbal and something ashy. Licorice perhaps? The mouthfeel is around medium. Smooth. The taste is as first sweet and then juicy with a nice herbal bite kicking in for good measure. I can see why this beer is so popular. It just arrived in New Hampshire in June 2021."
1658,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.29,"12.7 fl oz poured into WW short tulip glass. Bottled in June 2018. Best by October 26, 2038!? Maybe I am 27 years early? A translucent orange with pink highlights, little to no head or lace. No sign of yeast poop or sediment. The aroma is slightly sour, cherry, pear…there’s something lurking underneath, can’t quite place it. A flavor surge commences, slightly sour, olive, pear/apple cider. The initial olive notes fade a couple sips in. Whatever was lurking in the aroma starts appearing in the finish as it warms. Some type of funk or oak? Pear orange and pepper notes strengthen while maintaining a moderate amount of sourness. The feel is medium, carbonation medium high with a sharp finish. Everything melds together as it warms. Still learning to gauge this style. Worth a go. What does this develop into after 30 years? I can’t properly cellar anything that long (a year is a success) , though I may grab another one and try."
1659,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"B2 from the bottle, at about 65 degrees. L: Jet black. Dark, mocha head. Pours from bottle like motor oil. The beer leaves a dark brown tint and alcohol legs on parts of the glass it touches. S: As it pours, smells of marshmallow, chocolate complimented with a little barrel smell. Nothing overpowering. Incredible. F: Feels just like it looks. Motor oil in a glass. Coats the tongue like syrup. T: Huge, huge marshmallow and fudge flavors. There's barrel, but again, not overpowering. Absolutely fantastic. Near impossible to believe this has no adjuncts."
1660,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.54,"Pours a clear straw color, minimal head. Funky aroma with apricot, lemon, oak, and Chardonnay. Even tastes like a Chardonnay! Has a saison beer mouthfeel - funky, tart, sour, micro carbonation. Overall an outstanding beer. 12/13/18"
1661,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.58,"I was really fired up to land this. Took me a while but finally got it. Don’t get me wrong, it’s REALLY good. With that said, Tree House has put out better. I was disappointed. But like I said, really freaking good beer!"
1662,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.54,"I have seen this one a lot and because of my part time gig at the beer store it is my turn. Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass bottled on 2/13/21. Pours a hazy yellow with a 2 plus finger sticky white head that leaves thick streaks of lace with amazing retention. 4.75 Aroma is tangerine, pineapple, passionfruit, ripe melon, and apricot. 4.5 Taste follows tangerine, pineapple, cantaloupe, passionfruit, and apricot really balanced nothing dominant but really really good. 4.5 Mouthfeel is a solid medium, not sticky or dry, soft gentle almost creamy carbonation, and at 8.5% ridiculously easy going down. 4.75 Overall this one of those beers I have been dying to try and find out what all the hype is about and believe me it is well earned. Awesome stuff. 4.5"
1663,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.42,Poured a 2013 vintage into the test glass
1664,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.59,"Batch four, pour at FOFA. Straw yellow, hint of cloudiness, whisp of a just off white head. Citrus and earthy funk in the aroma, a hint of tartness in the form of green apple and sweet tart candy. Wine grapes and earthy wood. Soft and rich feeling on the tongue. An excellent brew, complex and refined flavors."
1665,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.36,"2018 Vintage Orange Wax The beer pours pitch black like heavy dense motor oil. It smells of char, whisky barrel, dates, and raisins. The beer tastes like cherry, raisins, tobacco, a little smoke, and heavy whisky barrel. The beer is very thick, 2 years smoothed it out a bit, but not much. It’s a fun stout to try, but wasn’t really my jam. I prefer Mornin Delight and KBBS. It would be nice to try other vintages."
1666,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.84,"L: Very cloudy yellow/orange with a thick white head, good retention and moderate lacing. S: Pungent, Dank tropical fruit. I get pineapple, peach, and candied grapefruit. T: Resinous tropical fruit flavors assault the palate start to finish. Pineapple juice galore with a very mild bitterness. The malt adds a nice candy like base for the hops to really shine. F: Medium bodied, very fluffy and soft. Overall: Wow, this beer is incredible. The balance of flavors and soft, juicy overall perception puts this, in my mind, at the Pinnacle of the NEIPA style. You must buy this if you get the chance."
1667,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.42,"2014 vintage; drank 10/29/15 @ Fischman's.  Opaque purple appearance.  Minimal khaki head; minimal lace.  Raspberry jam & a hint of smoke in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Raspberry jam, tart cherry & a hint of smoke up front; a slightly tart bite on the finish.  Palatable but very flavorful; delicious. Among the best fruit beers I've ever had."
1668,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.06,"A: Beautiful hazy lemonade is dank and juicy, thick and pulpy like breakfast juice. A sizeable capping, two inches, spongey textured foam composite is bright white and lasting. Liquid milky gold in the vessel. S: Watermelon and peach citrus nose. Fresh and juicy. Some pineapple juice sneaks in with a small finish of lemon. Good strength overall and what I come to expect from T.G.  T: Dank grapefruit-pineapple combo for flavor start. The flowery dry hoppiness really comes through with a bite of dry pine to boot. Some wet grassiness, tart lemon and sour citrus.  M: Soft and creamy body with a light carbonation.  O: Juicy nose full wet tropical while the flavor is full of DDH, lemon dank grassiness. A sting of sour citrus and dry flowery hop bite post swallow. Good drinkability."
1669,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.5,"2015 vintage (bourbon) drank on 12/26/2016. No head whatsoever, similar to the other HOTDs, which I always find enjoyable. boozy caramelly bourbon on the smell and nose. Not super thick, but definitely right on point for an Old Ale. Very well done beer here that I am happy to have finally gotten to enjoy"
1670,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.5,"Pale gold and clear until you hit the yeast at the bottom. Smells sweet and funky with hay and lemon. Nice sour, tart taste with lots of fruit. Reminds me of unripened pineapple and lemon zest. Nice sweetness and carb. Really great beer."
1671,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.71,"WOWZA! This was the 2018 edition. Such a big boy beer. Poured like thick black motor oil. Nose was subtle, but indicative of the lusciousness to come. Will definitely have to seek out other vintages. A top tier stout for me."
1672,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.87,"I understand that many brewmasters won’t even step foot in RR’s facility because they use Brettanomyces in this work of art but By God! this is the type of stuff no good beer advocate should ever live their entire life without trying at least once! Brown. Red. Dark. Seductive. And down right smoooooth. This Wild Sour is second to none in America as far as I’m concerned. Folks in CA and PA: don’t take it for granted! Word to the wise — Make the trip to Russian River, do yourself a favor and drop the $25 on 12 oz. bottle reserve. They’ll show you what you’ve been missing in your sour ale quest."
1673,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,3.93,"Color is hazy peach-orange with a minimal display of carbonation, maybe a thin blanket before dying to nothing. Smell is tangerine, nectarine, and lemon--bright! Taste is really tart grapefruit, tangelo, and cranberry. I have to say, it's so bright and tart, I think the apricot kind of gets drowned out by the work the microbes and oak are doing, unless these are particularly bright and citric apricots. It's not a bad thing though, this is pretty standout stuff. Semi-dry with a slight sting on the tongue mid-palate."
1674,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.69,"2017 bottle poured into a SARA bulb. Bright orange with some haze. Small white head forms and dissipates quickly. Smell is of stonefruit, funk and acidity. Taste is amazing. Ton of stone fruit, subtle funk and acidity. Super balanced. Feel is very nice. Actually found this to be a little “thick” and was very effervescent with the bubbles. Overall, this is an outstanding beer and deserves the hype. Thank you George for sharing!"
1675,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.25,"Picked up a bottle to-go at the brewery, enjoyed a few hours later. Golden hue with a thin head that fades quickly. Light effervescence.  Aroma is tart and crisp citrus - lemon and persimmon - with an oaky and earthy backdrop.  Dry and acidic, nothing jammy or enamel-striping-tart. Light, refined, prickly but not sharp."
1676,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,3.56,"Blend No. 2 (2018 release); consumed on 1/14/21 Pours a deep, jet-purple body with an airy half-finger of extra-pale mauve head, retreating quickly to a few paper-thin, spotty islands of cap, a sizeable, bubbly collar, and virtually no lacing beyond an occasional splotching isolated at various points around the glass. Aroma shows fresh blackberry pits engaging with an increasingly rounded lactic funk, sharpwning over time while simultaneously embracing jammy blackberry and a deepening sweetness as the beer warms; old leather and wet stone peak over the middle into fresher oak and some grape-like tannins to close. Taste ooens with suggestions of blackberry quijcly overtaken by lactic funk and a splintery oak profile; hints of dried peppercorn pair with a sturdy tannic structure into a mid-palate of barnyard funk and lemon zest, while tones of blackberry pits, lactic funk, and a brief burst of red berries mark the finish. Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fine, moderate-mild carbonation; a huge acidity is sharp and biting over the mid-palate, acetic and puckering though crisp into back end; a brief juiciness dries steadily with slight tannic textures on the finish. Increasingly palatable as it warms, an overwhelming acidity remains dominant, relegating the blackberry to an underdeveloped background while largely glossing over the nuance of the funk; this wild ale is clearly designed competently and shows sporadic sparks of genuine depth, but a relentless imbalance ultimately takes away from the overall product."
1677,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.71,"It’s a toss up as to which I prefer, this or Heady Topper."
1678,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.35,"Can. Tan head. Lace. Black color. Coffee, vanilla, and cacao. Coffee is a touch bitter. Not roasted. Sweetness from the vanilla. Smooth and creamy. Medium to full bodied. I enjoyed this more than the recent DS I had."
1679,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.7,"Decanted from a 16 oz (453 ml) can into a Tree House snifter; canned 11/25/20, code CHECK YOUR MIRRORS."
1680,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,5.0,"Pours black with a coffee and cream colored head that dissipates steadily into a foamy ring. Light cannot penetrate this thing, it's a veritable black hole. On the nose, gobs of bourbon barrel, charred oak, dark chocolate, roasted barley, coffee, caramel and cocoa. On the front of the palate we're smacked with that bourbon oak barrel - so much wood and booze. The bourbon oakiness is followed by chocolate, roasted barley, smoke, coffee, burnt sugar, and caramel. It finishes with a bit of alcohol burn. This is the bourboniest stout I've ever tasted. Full bodied with a lot of carbonation for a barrel aged stout. Overall, an extremely well crafted and balanced stout!"
1681,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,5.0,Hill Farmsteads finest! Amazing BA Saison that is smooth with a nice barrel finish. Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!
1682,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.39,"Sweet orange citrus, sweet bready-malty, and tropical hoppy dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a malt forward, tropical hoppy and hint of grapefruit citrus bitter swallow. The heavy malt presence upfront interferes a bit with enjoying the hoppy finish...makes the backend a little muddled and disjointed. What helps make up for that is that it is oh so soft on the palate! This still good and enjoyable, just didn't reach those sky high expectations I was anticipating."
1683,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.83,"GREEEEAT Notion. Love love love the PNW and GN. This is one of their best beers and every year we get the Double Stack. Funny we got this in a four pack of cans on drop day because we can't sit and have it on tap (SOOOO good on tap). On the drive home with the four pack sitting on my back seat I looked at Bren and asked ""can you smell maple?"". Of course she could, she is from the east coast where maple syrup is like beer here in Portland OR. Before we opened the can we could smell the maple. So, for those that say they can't get maple drinking this thing... idk what to tell you... ok so we got it home and had our 12 year old daughter help us carry things inside and when she did, she asked what maple did we get... lol... again the cans were weeping maple...  Look: dark, almost black , two finger width tan head with nice brown lacing down the glass as we drank"
1684,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.25,Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head and carbination. Fruity aroma. Taste is a dry tart with fruity accent that is not too harsh. A pleasant saison.
1685,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.52,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a very pleasant malt and bourbon. Taste is a very smooth pleasant blend of malt and bourbon.
1686,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.94,Hazy dark reddish mahogany with a massive tan head that persists and produces lots of nice lacing. 
1687,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.89,"This was an awesome experience, Finding the unicorn and then getting to taste it made my New Years Day extra special. I never thought that I would ever have this and then i did, The flavor is rich and delicious. I tasted a hint of fruit/caramel maybe, definitely decadent. This has made it's way to the #1 all time spot on my list. I don't believe anything will ever come close."
1688,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,3.6,"L: Dark Black except where light fringes the glass for a chocolate brown, a third finger dark mocha head with little retention or lacing. S: This is a boozy bourbon punch in the nose even after 9 months bottle aging. The smell is not a delectable bourbon, rather it smells like Everclear 190 proof with some vanilla for good measure. I definitely don't get anise haha or any finer thing like that. T: Anyone who says anise in my view is copying the notes. This is booze and far from beer finery. I don't get bourbon heat, instead the taste of vodka, with the smallest amounts of oak, vanilla, and chocolate in descending measure. F: The mouthfeel is light-medium and astringent, not thick as described, but decent enough to pass for a lighter BA stout."
1689,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.25,"375ml bottled 2 March 2015 A: Tangerine shade in appearance with an amber hue, and golden highlights. The head is light in formation, and quick to fade in retention, with middling legs on presently aged/submissive carbonation S: A motivated aroma by raw garden funk in cellared pears, citrus limetta, perished apricots, and stained yellow peaches that are backed by a musty cobwebbed satchel before the lactic saddlecloth. The backing in barnyard continues on vinous white grape, crisp apple skins, and blemished basement gooseberries. A nicely seasoned aroma that offers tart floral esters to a crisped oak breadiness in malt profiling T: Wild strains of bacterial gardens on palate, where traction is played underneath rustic, untamed hay and wooded pine saloons. A vintage that steers to earth bound grains while building on dusted, tannic mahogany in oak-aged vinegar. The advances in development are indicative to herbed gorgonzola, and spoiled (tart) lemon curd, which begin to soften in peppery resin and open to a rosy powdery mildew M: The feel has calmed a bit on bright effervesce for a more dry potency, given eased acidity and smooth viscosity in time/aeration. A body that baits importance across apt carbonation, and leans on ashy citrus as it approaches a more disciplined dry ending O: The longevity offers balance, and appropriate timing, in offbeat (fragile) complexities"
1690,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.35,"L:. Pours a pitch black with a very small brown tan head and a some dots of lacing around the glass. S:. Creamy rich chocolate, a bit of vanilla, some coffee reminiscent of mocha or coffee ice cream. Smells very rich and decadent. T:. Creamy rich chocolate, some vanilla, mixes with a mocha like coffee and a coffee ice cream, not overly sweet but very nice. F:. Thick full body, some cola like carbonation but mostly creamy. O:. This is a fantastic stout!"
1691,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.5,"Damn this is ridiculously good. It was bursting with stone fruit and the as usual the carb was perfect. I will say after having it side by side with fuzzy, that the stone fruit doesn't pop like the peaches in Fuzzy, but still amazing."
1692,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.14,"Batch 4 (thanks Mike!) served in a HF tulip. Pours a burnished orange hue with a frothy, off-white head that dissipates into a bubbly band around the edges. Nose expresses vinous notes, a hint of vanilla and a trace of apple cider vinegar. Taste consistent with nose; however, the flavor profile comes off a bit watered down. There's also the addition of lemon peel. Mouthfeel is light in body with a soft carbonation and a mild acidity. Overall, quite tasty but not sure it lives up to the hype."
1693,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.78,"Incredible beer. Thanks to @jdhowe for the share. Beautiful purplish hue with strong blackberry aroma. Very sour, but not too acidic. A little funk, but probably more on the nose. Delicious beer."
1694,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.28,"2015 Bottle, taster flight at Wades Wines in Westlake, CA. Pours a light hazy gold, very much like a grisette in appearance. Thin creamy head, medium lace. Mild aromas, getting hints of lemon to square out the funky yeast smells that punch through. Getting Brett-like qualities. Very tart, full of white grape must and apple. A nice mineral quality, and if it weren’t for the funk and sharp tartness this has a lot of qualities of a Chardonnay. Seltzery, crisp, thin body. Sharp, but not unpleasant."
1695,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.66,"07/2016 - This is incredible - hype realized! Gueuze-esque; peach, apricot, funk on the nose; wee cinnamon, fruity, barnyard taking over the palate; acidic, yet still oh so clean of a finish; dope!"
1696,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.53,The most beautiful purple pink I have ever seen. It looks like juice. Sparking with color. Rhubarb hue to it. Wow. So much fruit juice. It's so tropical. Nice tartness. Very faint funk. Light bodied. Ends clean. Refreshing. Everything I want in a Berliner. This stuff is the real deal.
1697,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.59,"2018 edition courtesy of Lingenbrau Pour is black, somewhat viscous, moderate tan head.  Smells like bourbon soaked cocoa nibs with oak and vanilla. A touch boozy. Some maple syrup/caramized sugars and burnt coffee grounds in the background.  Maple flavor strikes first. Not overpowering, but prominent. The bourbon follows with oak, vanilla, and corn mash, rounded out by rich milk chocolate and a subtle roasted coffee.  Every one of their beers I have had has been in the Bourbon County, Firestone Walker category as far as body goes. This one is a touch thinner, but still exceptionally full and luscious without being syrupy (especially with syrup) or cloying. Just a touch of lip smacking stickiness.  It definitely shows some of the ABV both in aroma and taste, especially if you were to compare to a Bourbon County varient that is stronger, but a phenomenal beer that pretty much lives up to the label."
1698,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.5,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of intense notes of chocolate mix in with some maple syrup and bourbon with vanilla notes also noticeable. Taste is also a mix of sweet chocolate notes, maple syrup with some woody notes, bourbon and vanilla notes also perceptible. Body is full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation with some light warming alcohol notes. World-class imperial stout from a great brewery."
1699,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.02,"Pint can of Heady-Topper dated 06/05/21. Served in a can glass, because I want to. Pours slightly hazy and with a nice white head, though not quite as cloudy or murky as Focal Banger. Aroma is not the most potent, but it has a more traditional pine hop profile than I expected. Inhaling deeply I do get a bit of sweet juice. Flavor is big on those tropical juicy flavors. Guava, mango, grapefruit zest. Where Focal Banger has considerable IBUs and conventional alpha bitterness, Heady Topper has the strength and even a hint of the 8% ABV is actually present on the palate. But this is really only a comparative defect; compared to millions of other IPAs the alcohol is still very well hidden. Tasting this side by side with Focal Banger I appreciate the differences but confirm my initial impression from 4 years ago in Burlington -- I prefer FB. Both have an excellent mouthfeel, with very fine carbonation, which by itself might be remarkable for an American IPA in a can. But this beer is quite literally heady -- and I'm not one to shy away from heavy beers in the 8-12% range or even higher. But the balance and flavors in Focal Banger are just better in my opinion, even better than this unarguably great beer. Potentially this is Heady Topper's 15,000th review??"
1700,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,3.91,"This smells like a belgian dubbel and tastes like mild american wild. While this is a very nice beer, im dramtically underwhelmed. This is something along the lines of homebrew competition winner"

1703,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.24,"Split with Goblinmunkey7 on 8/19/17, review from notes A: Golden straw with a touch of orange, lightly hazy, pours with a fluffy, medium-sized white head, retains its fluffiness, leaves great streaks of lacing S: Funky, deep, complex - saison funk, yeast funk, barnyard funk - light tartness - lemon - flowery and floral - light grains, light sweetness - loads of wood, rich oak - layers of funk T: Bright saison funk and tartness - farmhouse weirdness including some damp cellar and straw - some brighter acidity and lemon - flowery - some pear, green apple - rich oak, chewy wood - light sweetness with some lingering funk M: Medium body, medium carbonation, crisp with lingering tart funk  O: Cellarman is the hero Gotham deserves Cellarman flirts with almost being too funky to be a saison, but it does not cross any lines (not that anyone is really too concerned). It's bright, it's tart, it's like drinking a barn."
1704,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.79,"Thank you to my friends at Carmine Street Tap Room. I will always patronize an establishment that just does't sell beer, they love it. There is something pleasant about balancing the undeniable greatness of bitterness. This is something that Trillium might do better than any other brewer. Bitter is the quintessential taste that complexity finds in mastery. Well done. L: Thick like honey appearance"
1705,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.62,"Review 1528 I am stoked to consume this beer! Thank you WunderLlama for giving me this beer. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a nonic. The pour of the beer created a magnificent three-fingered head. The bright white foamy and creamy head left lacing on the glass as it slowly dissipated. The color of the beer is SRM 3, pale straw with light golden colors. This beer is hazy. The appearance of the beer is exceptional.  The initial aromas in the beer are citrus, lemons, papaya, and pineapple. Nosing further, I detect toasted bread crust, oranges, floral esters, a hint of herbal, and a malty sweetness.  The flavors in the beer are orange, lemon, papaya, pineapple mango, bready, floral esters, a hint of phenols, a dash of herbal, and a subtle earthiness.  The mouthfeel of the beer is astringent and dry.  The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and a full finish A beautifully constructed beer. The flavors and the balance of the beer are on point. This is what a NEIPA should taste like. Excellent beer. I wish I had more."
1706,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.75,"Poured opaque but not murky, golden honey in color with soft billowing head of vanilla white foam which left lacing all the way down the glass."
1707,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.43,"Pours dark black with a small beige head that fades quickly. The aroma has apple brandy, dark chocolate, cocoa, and dark roasted malt. Tastes like it smells. Sweet taste. Not much of th dark roasted malt comes through, so there is no balancing bitterness. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. A very drinkable beer. I love the Apple Brandy barrel. It is a nice change of pace."
1708,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.2,"Pours out super hazed pineapple juice like color, thin bright white head recedes quickly, minimal to no lacing. Pretty punchy aromas of grapefruit, lemon, and mango, some pithy and dank green notes as well. On palate is acidic grapefruit and orange juice, pine needles, harsh and almost chalky green herbal quality, hop burn, no real malt to speak of. Mouthfeel is decent but suffers as a result of the chalky and harsh aspects of the flavor profile. Overall this was a decent beer, but not top notch. Had multiple cans and one was compared blind to TH C44 ... no contest at all."
1709,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.37,"really well done berliner type with tropical fruit. its one of the better fruity berliners i have had, and one of the best uses of these fruits i have seen in any beer, and while i loved it, im not sure it ranks among the best beers i have ever had overall, and wasnt even my favorite beer from j wakefield, although its probably still deserving of most of its hype! doesnt look like much, orange and hazy, quite thick for a beer so low in alcohol. the aroma is shocking, intensely sour, acidic, mouthwatering, puckery, all of it. with the passion fruit leading the charge, but the other fruits quite authentic and obvious in the aroma as well, juicy and intense, really different from other beers, more and more fresh. the flavor matches the aroma, with a real intense fruity complexion, passion fruit and orange and mango for sure, all really alive and bold in here, but never too sweet. thats the brilliance i think, keeping it dry. it doesnt feel light to me though, lots of body and texture, and even the high acidity doesnt lighten it up much. surprised its so clean too, gone but the palate begs for another gulp as soon as it is swallowed. this is not a style i usually flock to, especially with these fruits, where more often than not its gimmick over quality. this is awesomely delicious, a leader in its class no doubt!"
1710,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,3.94,Received from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF 10 – Thanks Derek! Reviewed 2/16/20.
1711,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.33,"16oz can, dated 08.05.19, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 08.25.19, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a super hazy orange color, amber hues, super turbid with a foamy finger of white head that has minimal retention but decent lacing. The aroma is very nice, crazy dank and grassy, raw green hop leaf, hop spice, lots of piney resin and some herbal tea brings forward a more floral and citrusy character, tons of bitter grapefruit peel with a bit of underlying tropical fruit and soft pale dough. The flavors are in line with the nose, toeing the line between dank and juicy, grassy, raw green hop, light spice, resinous pine, pineapple, citrus peel, mango and peach with a bit of warming booze and soft dough. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick with a heavier body that's lively and punchy and finishes with a warm and dry boozy finish.  Verdict: A super good IIPA from Alpine. It's big, it's intense, it's about as hoppy as one can get but that 8.88% ABV is definitely there. Definitely a top IPA from Alpine, who already have a great lineup of worthy beers."
1712,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.74,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Sante Adarius tulip glass. Drank right after tasting West Ashley Thanks Jake for the trade.  Pours a hazy light orange body, looks almost pulpy with a one finger white fizzy head that reduces quickly. Leaves little lacing.  On the nose, it’s very fruit-forward and champagne-like. Tons of stone fruit aromas, very juicy and potent. Psyched to taste this based on the nose! On the tongue, it’s very tart upfront but the fruit is delicate and balanced. Just enough apricot flavors. Very juicy and crisp, lightly funky, champagne, white wine flavors. Oak barrel flavors show up slightly on the follow through. Mouthfeel is spot on with refreshing, medium-high carbonation.  I’d say this lived up to the hype, it was smoother and more delicate, less sour and more fruity than West Ashley."
1713,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.01,"this review comes with an asterisk, which is that i must have had a somewhat off experience with this one, in that there is no way the whole world loves this so much and i found it unremarkable. i have wanted to try this for a long long time and was so stoked to finally get the chance, but i suspect a distributor or an account or even the brewery held on to this keg for way too long, knowing they had something special here and wanting to save it for just the right moment. well, to me it tastes like that moment had long passed by the time this one was flowing, the coffee tastes and smells stale, and it has seemingly broken down some of the body that makes this base beer so monumental. what i can appreciate is what its supposed to be, a rich espresso layer over one of the most flavorful and interesting stouts to ever exist, an unnecessary but fancy layer, a little green peppery now, and a little acidic and thinning, but probably absurdly appealing in its prime. the alcohol is somehow really well hidden, maybe one benefit of its apparent age, cant believe its as strong as it is. some nice dark chocolate and char to this, still plenty of barrel on it too, faint vanilla and tobacco as well, lots happening but wonderful integration at the same time. i enjoyed this still a lot, impossible not to, but in this instance certainly not one of the best beers in the world. i know what it can be though, and i cant wait to try it under more idea conditions... until next time!"
1714,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.63,"A: Pour is slightly cloudy, with a golden yellow hue. Head is about a half inch, with great retention and generous lacing S: Vinous grapes and apples, herbal, floral and fruity. The notes are extremely gentle and involved: oak, wood, lemon, citrus, honey, with a slight funk component T: Hints at a subtle tartness and sweetness, while being earthy floral, and fruity. More funk, brett and barrel character, as one reads into it and lets it sit. Notes correspond to the aroma, and bring forth honey, oak, grain/hay, lemon, and citrus M: Crisp yet soft, and smooth with timely dryness: medium carbonation, and body O: The duly maturation, amongst the French oak wine barrels, is quite beautiful. The convolutions linger, and grow as it rests"
1715,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.54,"2018 Vintage, enjoyed on election night 2020. Can't remember who sent me this but won in a NFL BIF from 2019. Poured bottled into snifter. Has a bit of sweetness, some spice, good amount of chocolate and a boozy finish"
1716,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.5,"Pours a completely opaque bright orange color. Thick and juicy. Two to three finger off-white head forms on top of the beer before dissipating leaving a thin residual layer of foam on top of the beer.  Aroma has lovely bright notes of orange, citrus, pineapple, mango, tropical fruit, with a light green grassy hop note on the back end.  Taste follows the nose with robust notes of orange, citrus, pineapple, mango, tropical fruits, dried grassy hops on the back end with a pleasant but mild bitterness. There is some sweetness to the beer, but its not overwhelming.  Feel is medium to moderately full bodied. There is a real heftiness to the beer. Prickly carbonation.  Overall its a lovely, well crafted IPA."
1717,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.23,"Look: Jet black, pours thick"
1718,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.63,"Bottle at share. WOW! Silky black pour, ring of brown head. Mellow aroma of chocolate and coffee. Taste brings some brown sugar sweetness, coffee, chocolate, perfectly blended, smooth. Light warmth."
1719,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.01,Pours cloudy amber with a bunch of floaties drifting around inside. Aroma is hoppy citrus. Taste is hop bitter with some citrus notes. Feel is a bit astringent but not unpleasant. Overall it’s an interesting hoppy DIPA.
1720,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.75,A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a finger of dense light tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
1721,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.94,"So, finally trying this one was an achievement... did it live up to the hype? Oh yes, absolutely! Insanely great balanced, with hops, fruityness as well as a solid body. Extremely well balanced. Delicious!"
1722,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.52,"Pours a deep black with more than head than expected, thicker than I remember last year Lots of nice barrel on both nose and taste. Very smooth and no heat. Love this one and will seek it out every year."
1723,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.59,"I am going to start off by saying I like this beer and would happily have it again, but the number 2 beer in the world? Not a chance! Shimmering jet black with a brown cap that fades into a ring. The nose is the star of the beer: huge vanilla and bourbon, toasty rustic oak, dark chocolate fudge, roasted malts, date, a hint of coffee, brown sugar and molasses. Taste really does well to accentuate the tannins in the wood with the bourbon and vanilla as the excavators, maltwork is robust and characteristic of the base, sweet dark lord flavors that were detected in the nose poke through, on the sweeter side of the style for sure. Feel is very warm, full, heavy, viscous, and robust without getting syrupy, wonderful but sweeter feeling, barrel character is great. The best variant yet I have tried"
1724,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.57,"Pours hazy, yellow gold in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is orange pith, herbal hops, and tangerine. Medium heavy bodied...The body really works for this beer, slightly bitter, with moderate carbonation. Very good beer. Juicy but not overly so. Would get this again."
1725,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,2.31,I hate this beer. I just paid $10 for 1 12 ounce bottle of it and that would be fine if it was great but I hate it! I usually love dark beer. Even in the summer I'm ordering whatever porter or stout is at the bar. This one is all wrong. It claims to be vanilla coconut. I dont taste either. It just taste like any other dark beer but with an awful hard to swallow bitterness. I'm so annoyed with this beer right now. If it hadn't cost $10 and if it was 13% alcohol (something I didn't realize until after I bought it) I'd have thrown it out already.
1726,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,5.0,I am lucky that I live in a acceptable range to get the Westvleteren 12 bottles. 
1727,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.13,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a taster. Thanks Kevin for sharing this beer.  Dark brown body with a light tan head.  Medicinal vanilla, sweet vanilla extract, cherry, finish is lightly bitter . Low carbonation and a little watery."
1728,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.0,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass not sure when it was bottled and don’t care. Pours midnight black with a 2 plus finger head that falls at record speed and leaves no lace. 4 Smell is roasty coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and roasted hazelnut. 4 Taste follows alcohol upfront, cocoa nibs, Expresso beans, vanilla, toffee, and some hazelnut in the bold finish. 4 Mouthfeel is a little bigger than average, moderate carbonation, a touch dry, and drinks easy enough, but the alcohol is around. 4 Overall this is a very nice stout, big and bold, and hits on all the usual expectations, with a little extra booze in the long lingering finish. Thanks Jzeilinger for this roast bold treat."
1729,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.84,"BADL '16 2016 bottle. Chalice glass. Had at a 4 person-4 bottle share: Barrel Aged Dark Lord '16, French Vanilla Militia '17, Marshmallow Handjee '17 and Barrel Aged Abraxas '17 (in that order). Pours pitch black and extremely viscous with no foam head. It was so viscous, I thought it was going to stain the glass! Very pleasant bourbon sweetness aroma. Not boozy! It was like BCBS on steroids. Taste had a good amount of barrel presence, nutty, oaky, chocolate and sweetness. Really thick and sticky. Basically after the first sip, my lips started sticking.  This finished as a consensus 2nd out of the 4 (only behind Marshmallow Handjee '17). It exceeded everyone's expectations. All vintages had:"
1730,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.64,"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a big fluffy white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of pineapple, melon, kumquat, and tangerine. It tastes of pineapple, lemon, tangerine, and melon. The feel is light, and smooth. A nice ipa from Hill Farmstead."

1732,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.13,"Canned 12/28/18, “Love is all you need stamped on the bottom of the can Taking a break from the hoppy Tree House beers, we have the second highest rated milk stout. I should note that this is not from the mixed pack I got last week, but it was chilling in the back of my friend’s fridge and she said I could have it lol. Not sure how it held up over the course of a year and a half but we’ll see Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of espresso colored head that fades to a cap quickly and leaves nice lacing Huge aromas of dark roast coffee, dates, chocolate malts, and lightly roasted peanuts. A nice combination of smells here The beginning of the sip is surprisingly light with mild coffee and char. The finish brings more roasty creamy peanut butter and dark fruits. Not as good as the aroma suggested but still quite sweet A medium to full body with almost no carbonation, this drinks smooth and finishes sticky. No alcohol heat from the 7.6% So this was good, but it could be better. To be fair, this is a milk stout approaching 2 years of age, so I’ll take what I can get"
1733,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.62,"Two finger head with retention on a beautifully light-hearted hazy hue. Nose and taste is a little tropical but mostly pineapple and pine with some great and subtle herbal qualities. Shared with a friend then immediately went to work for a Trillium trade! I've tried to do it again with no bites, I won't give up - this place lives up to the hype!"
1734,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.68,"This one pours a very hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing. This smells like sweet orange, dank hops, pine, mango, grapefruit, and pineapple. This really is as good as it gets for NE-style IPA. It's so saturated with delicious hop character, with no burn, and a pleasant light bitterness on the back end.  This is creamy, rich, and super drinkable. There's so much flavor, but it drinks light and breezy due to the lower ABV. This is truly tremendous. With the glut of NE-style IPAs out there, it's easy to get burnt out and tired of this style. However, every so often, a truly phenomenal version comes along and reminds you of why so many people are obsessed with the style."
1735,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.18,"Shared 355 ml bottle at local tasting. Pitch black colour, no head. Strong and intense aroma of bourbon / oak / vanilla, nearly hiding the roasty, chocolate and coffee notes in the background. Low carbonation. Sweet and rich flavour, notes of bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate and coffee."
1736,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.49,"At last got my hands on this RR classic! Golden orange with no head save a clear ring. Wonderful aromas of oak, wet earth, lemon, grass, hay, grapefruit zest, barrel must, and grains. Taste is more acidic and vinegar forward, but has all the same flavors from the smell, with an ending backed by sour oak and plenty of funk, but also leaves the palate pretty citrus sweet. Not the most complex, but plenty flavorful. Feel is tart, funky and has a vinegar artful harshness."
1737,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.8,Poured from a 330cl bottle into a Triple glass. Pours a lovely brown color with plenty of head. Smells really wonderful. Perhaps like a sweet pumpernickel bread? Very nice carbonation. The taste is unlike anything I’ve really ever had. Distinctive and delicious. Will pick up another six pack when I’m again In de vrede.
1738,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.47,"Canned 4/23/21. Pours an opaque dark yellow, with a short bubbly head that reduces to a film. Lovely irregular lacing. S: Peach, orange, tangerine, pineapple. A bit of bubble gum. T: Follows the nose up front, then smooths out and finishes dry but only slightly bitter. Zero alcohol heat, despite the 8.2% ABV. F: The usual soft and awesome Tree House mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation. O: A delicious DIPA with no discernable flaws."
1739,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.96,Batch 1 bottle
1740,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.39,"this is really good, no doubt about it, but not as good as they say it is i dont reckon, and once again a side project beer doesnt quite live up to its hype. their culture has trended super sour lately, and this is another expression of that, just really acidic beer, complex still, still lots of nuance, bretty funk and oak and all, but its the bacterial intensity that takes over this one and makes it a hard large bottle to drink, even split a couple of ways. i really like to let these types of beers warm up a little bit, but not here, its best when its colder, with temperature comes acidic intensity thats hard on the teeth and belly. i like all the apricot of course, about as natural as it gets, super ripe and even soft and fuzzy like the real fruit, very forward and incredibly natural and delicious, the authenticity is through the roof. i kind of wanted to taste more of the wine in the barrel profile, which is tannic and heavily oaky, but not as red wine forward as i might have thought for cabernet. all the wood is nice, subtle vanilla and even white tea somehow, killer with the apricots, peach juice notes, even green apple and white grape wrapped up in here, lots going on, but instead of mellowing into a slow tart bretty funkiness like i wish it did, the sourness cranks and disrupts the delicate beauty, it finishes harsh and big. i mean, in all respects this is great beer, but it just doesnt stand with the best wild beers in the world to my palate, maybe those who prefer a more assertive acidity will disagree, but i think its a little too much, unflattering to the fruit, and at $45 a bottle it just doesnt do it for me..."
1741,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.49,"Nice subtle honey without being overly sweet, and very smooth to drink. Of course its delicious but it wasn't quite the world breaker I was expecting. Definitely don't pass on it, but there are IMO much better beers to trade half your cellar away for."
1742,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.53,"16 oz can poured into a tulip pint glass. Bitter, piney, citrusy, caramel, slightly grassy. Bursting with hop aroma and flavor. Incredibly well-balanced and drinkable despite the 8% abv. I think I prefer this to Heady and Focal."
1743,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.89,"Genuinely one of the best beers in the world. I have no idea how they managed to say the beer has ""waves and waves of hop flavor"" and then actually accomplish that. There is without a doubt sorcery involved here but I'll take it. It is worth selling your soul for on at least six days of the week."
1744,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.3,"So, the beer pours a rich looking, apricot amber color with pretty decent head retention and light lacing. On the nose, there's a huge aroma of mango, papaya, apricot and pineapple. The mosaic hop presence is pretty pronounced in this bad boy. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, but the tropical fruit flavor wasn't as intense as I was expecting. Mouthfeel was also a bit less full than I was expecting, though I appreciate the fairly light, dry and moderately bitter finish in this beer. The finish is very clean in this beer, and the alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile. So drinkability is pretty good. This is a very good DIPA for sure, though I don't think it quite matches up with the #7 version I tried last night. However, I think a bit more sweetness and richness on the palate would improve this DIPA immensely.  Still a very good beer from the folks at HF."
1745,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.49,Yes Maple please. This thing is something I would pour over pancakes.
1746,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.47,"Bottled on 2/3/21; consumed on 3/3/21 Pours a deep, glistening, clear honey-gold body topped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, eggshell-white foam; good head retention fades to barely a half-finger of equally thick cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a firm, chunky veil of lacing caked comprehensively around the walls of the glass. Aroma offers a distinctly balanced array of nuanced contrasts, moving seamlessly from dank mango and ripe gooseberry, to apricot skins and orange marmalade/chutney readily apparent; an unflinching, flaky malt backdrop supports a deft dosing of pungent, waxy dankness moving seamlessly into wet moss, floral pine, and pink grapefruit zest on the back end of the bouquet. Taste opens with pink grapefruit brightening a dense conifer medley as it meshes with candied lime peel for a uniquely sweet potpourri undercurrent; clementine and sharp grassiness over the mid-palate leads into tangerine juice saturation with fading white grape and waxy, dank characteristics through the back end and finish. Mouthfeel presents a nimble, medium body met with a fluffy spritz of moderate carbonation, inviting and dispersing a subtly building resin steadily clinging to the palate; the back end produces a taut, tingly bitterness paired with a drying contrast to a deft, distantly sticky texture as a pure, crisp peak marks the finish with barely a hint of booziness. A slight yet thoughtful amplification of Pliny the Elder, this is dangerously drinkable and every bit as supremely crafted as its DIPA counterpart; the sweetness of a TIPA is lulled with distant conifer for the most palatable charge of hop resin, equal yet uniquely defined parts bitter, sweet, and malty; the comprehensive hoppy sipper."
1747,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.59,"On tap at Republic. Poured an opaque, jet-black color with a small, brown head of foam. It smelled of bourbon, oak, vanilla, coffee, dark chocolate and toffee. Rich bourbon taste with dark chocolate, vanilla, toffee and a roasted malt."
1748,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.75,"One of the best of the best! Top-notch Double IPA that drinks like a much lighter beer, and pairs with just about everything. A must-try for IPA lovers."
1749,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.74,16 oz can poured in a pint glass - pours hazy golden with a foamy head. Wonderful citrus and floral aroma though not as strong on the nose as I would have expected. Smooth mouth feel with a lingering hoppiness and dry finish. Fantastic beer! So glad it is finally available in the South East.
1750,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.0,"Ok, to start off, this is sweet. It does smell like cocoa powder, almost like opening a packet of swiss miss. Flavor is like lactose, dark chocolate, and hershey's syrup. Overall a bit too sweet for me but an interesting beer."
1751,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.84,"Deep gold pour with excellent clarity; white head; good cap retention; heavy ring; medium heavy lacing; no legs. Nose is caramel malt, citrus peel, tropical fruit with a whiff of pine. Bitter grapefruit rind balanced by semi sweet malt foundation; layers of tangerine, lemon, pineapple and mango; some pine with a hint of onion and garlic in the middle; bitter lemon zest finish. Medium body with grainy fullness feel; moderate minus, streaming carbonation; no warmth from 8.2% abv; no hop astringency; creamy, bready, malty mouthfeel with some sticky resin too. Overall, an amazing DIPA; delish layers of citrus and tropical fruit from the hops and a rock solid malt foundation that balances the bitterness; exactly what I enjoy drinking in an IPA!"
1752,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.25,"375ml bottle, 2021 release, poured into a stemless wine glass. The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a thin finger of tan head, very fizzy with no retention nor lacing. The aroma is nice, lots of dark chocolate, charred oak, molasses, bourbon spirit, brown sugar, caramel, light maple, stone fruits and hearty grain. The flavors are nice, lots of dark chocolate, a bit of roasted grain, toasted barrel, burnt wood, maple and brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, spicy bourbon spirit, stone fruits and a bit of licorice. The mouthfeel is very good, coating and lively with a heavy medium body that is smooth and finishes warmly. Verdict: A nice barrel-aged porter from Jackie O's. The balance is very nice, lots of rich and decadent flavors but even with the maple, it doesn't veer into an overly sweet space. The barrel character is well developed and it has a great body that really helps deliver the flavors."
1753,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.5,"L: Poured from a growler to a pint glass. Had a dark brown / black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a quarter inch of creamy, tan-colored, long-lasting head. Very good lacing. S: An incredibly enticing aroma of maple syrup, malt, bourbon, coffee, and chocolate. T: Tasted of a bit of malt (not a huge factor), a good shot of bourbon (and its accompanying barrel), a hint of vanilla, a ton of maple syrup (quite sweet), a bit of chocolate, and some coffee. This is a rich, sweet, terribly well-balanced flavor. The maple syrup is definitely the dominant force, but it's never cloying. Tasty stuff. F: A decent amount of carbonation with a warm, smooth finish. Full-bodied. O: An exceptionally well made stout. Drinkable."
1754,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.25,"I enjoyed this beer, especially the nose. The nose promised bright floral hop perfection, but after taking it on I expected the taste to be different. It is more earthy than I expected. It is a great dipa, but the taste does not invite the next sip as well as other excellent IPAs I've had from this fine brewer."
1755,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.62,"L: dark orange, full pulp orange juice. Complete haze that poured thick with a white fluffy head that fades fast"
1756,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.66,Hazy with nice lacing. Taste is floral with great citrus notes. I continue to be impressed by this brewery. I once tried to visit in the Dead of winter and just couldn't bring myself to stand in line all the way around an acre lot. My mistake. These guys rock. A+
1757,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.02,"Pours a semi translucent golden color with a nice egg shell colored head, which if left undisturbed turns into little cream like dollops,A noticeable amount of sediment is present. This is a very fresh beer. Smells like mild fruit loops,fresh grass ,some conifer.Taste pineapple bread like profile, the mosaic hop is definitely well showcased in a subtle malt bill, almost wanting a bit more malt. Feels medium body, finishes juicy.Overall a very good DIPA showcase beer. REVISION: 3/22/21, this beer is tasty but the amount of sediment on the bottom of a Teku glass looks about 2 Teaspoons. It sort of turns me off. Is it yeast? some hop pieces? not really sure."
1758,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.25,"Having on draft in a pint glass. Dark amber color with a slight haze and one finger head. Smells of burnt caramel and toasted orange rind. Totally full bodied with creamy carbonation texture. Flavors of roasted pineapple, peach with toasted orange rind bitterness. Long lasting fruit sweetness and bitterness."
1759,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.56,"Looks like a glass of orange juice in the glass with a bone white head that is a bit fluffy and a LOT clingy, sticking to the glass as the beer descends. The nose is heavy on ripe oranges and mango, with other tropical fruit aromas as well. The taste is also dominated by the ripe orange and mango flavors, and there’s a nice pineapple flavor as well. The mouthfeel is per the NEIPA style and fits well with this world-class juice bomb."
1760,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.02,"A: An upbeat melon, carrot orange pour with mild yellow inserts. The collar is practical and comes slightly off-white with adequate retention S: The scent is energetic with rustic acidity, and upfront leggings in Riesling stone fruit: cherries, apricots, peaches, nectarines. The development is delayed from sharp acidity, but eventually picks up on the courtyard subtleties in oaked woodland, wheat orchards, cellared satchel, and peppered haystacks against the tempered/relaxed wine barrel T: More shaded barrel on taste peering alongside the wild horse blanket and funky greenwood. Tartness remains on crisp apricot, earthy pine needles, and honey fruit leather to skins of crunchy gold apple pears. There is a peppery, cutting sour bite throughout, but not crumbling to palate or too forceful/cut-throat with slight ventilation. Intensity varies and contracts in lapses, as involvedness constructs in temperature to warming cedar, mildewed pastures, white grape-vanilla jam, and softened fruit-nut bread M: Light, effervescent feel with medium carbonation and a prickly, peppery spice that ends parched O: A fair bit of workings coming out of a matured (2+ yrs.) Blend #3, where stability bobs thru piercing acidity: gravitates more sensibly over time to composure"
1761,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.84,"I was able to get in on a case buy a couple years ago. This is an amazing barleywine! Pours dark brown to black in the glass. Has a sweet front and backend and hides the alcohol very well. It’s a great beer to sip on the beach with a fire and watching the sunset. One of my favorites by Pelican Brewing. If you get a chance to be on the Oregon coast, this is a must see location for any beer lover! You won’t be disappointed with the beer or venue!"
1762,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.75,"Pours a deep black with no head and only a thin ring of tan around the edge. The smell is divine. Dark fruits, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, and now dark fruits. The taste is bourbon, vanilla, raisin and finishes with char and leather. The 14.6% abv comes through but minimally and warming. The mouthfeel is velvet. It coats the mouth with low carbonation and a long, slightly dry finish. Overall, this is excellent. Great flavors that balance well. A slow sipper for sure."
1763,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.52,"Poured from a 16oz can into a Treehouse tulip glass.  Pours a deep black, inky body with a substantial frothy brown head that reduces to leave nice layered lacing.  Aromas are straight chocolate fudge and cocoa, Hershey's syrup, coffee. On the tongue it's decadent and rich but not overly filling or cloyingly sweet, very drinkable silky smooth body with milk chocolate and cocoa dominating flavor, and a coffee aftertaste."
1764,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,3.85,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a small, fluffy, dark-brown head. Smells of slightly roasted, caramel malt and a huge cinnamon aroma that drowns out almost everything else except for a distinct Bourbon note, as well as hints of chocolate, vanilla and licorice managing to poke through. Taste is a decent balance of slightly smoked and roasted, quite caramelly malt and a huge, sweet cinnamon presence, although the flavor manages just a bit more depth than the nose, with more distinct chocolate, licorice, molasses and dark fruit notes of raisin and fig coming through here, with a good, not too boozy, Bourbon character and hints of vanilla, tobacco and charred oak. Finishes rather sweet, with a very light bitterness and some cinnamon, licorice and Bourbon lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation. After BA Dark Star this is another big disappointment from Fremont for me, which I had also been saving for a special occasion, just like the former. Similar to BA Abraxas, which I also consider highly overrated, this is a total cinnamon bomb that is way too sweet for my personal taste and just lacking overall balance, while the mouthfeel, while very nice, is hardly outstanding either in my personal opinion. Although it does make for a very rich brew with a good Bourbon presence that never turns quite as boozy as BA Dark Star, the sweetness from the cinnamon, licorice and molasses is just too much and while there is a decent complexity to this, most of it gets drowned out by the overly dominant cinnamon character that the lightly smoked/roasted malts and mild bitterness are really struggling against, while the dark fruits and vanilla only add to that overdone sweetness here. I'm not saying it's a bad brew, being quite rich and with a good complexity, mouthfeel and bourbon presence, just not that well balanced for my personal taste, being way too sweet and dominated by the cinnamon, while I would have wished for the smoked/roasted malt and bitterness to shine through more distinctly here."
1765,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.23,"2017 on draft; A: opaque; dark brown in color; less than a 1 finger medium brown head that receded quickly to a thin collar; no lacing; S: boozy; bourbon, vanilla, and oak; milk chocolate in the background, but this is all about the bourbon barrel aging; T: chocolate dominates from start to finish; vanilla, bourbon, and charred oak are in the background; boozy finish is mild to moderately bitter; M: full bodied - sticky; low to moderate carbonation; alcohol is warming, but way understated for 13.5%; O: dangerously easy to drink; really, really, good;"
1766,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.63,"A know-it-all told me that this is Alchemist's best. I won't argue the point. Absolutely solid. Citrusy. Must go to Vermont and see the brewery. The AVB is seven so for me, an old man, it's possible to enjoy two cans of this treat."
1767,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.16,"2020 release. Released a month or so ago. A: Pours black, kinda thin, with a smattering of dark brown head that recedes quickly to a razor thin ring. No lacing or retention to speak of. S: Medium roast coffee in the forefront, modest amount of dark roastiness and vanilla bark, a bit of cola and chocolate. T: Moderately sweet milk chocolate and coffee, sharp almost tannic roast, a bit of vanilla extract. Not much complexity, really. M: A bit on the thin side, with medium, sharp carbonation. Light alcohol burn.  O: Decent effort but nothing to write home about."
1768,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,1.34,"A tremendous let down. The barrel aged version of Last Snow, and just as big of a let down. Look: Pours what looks to be light-medium bodied. That’s immediate disappointment. You’re a barrel aged porter, you should look robust and either full bodied, or the high end of medium bodied.  Nose: What’d you expect: Coconut and Barrel mostly. Taste: Barrel Aged Coconut Water Feel: Far too light in my mouth for what I’m looking for. Overall: Like the other porters I’ve recently tried from Funky Buddha, I had high hopes, only to be let down. Beer Advocate has about 150 beers with a 100 rating, and this is one of them. It is not deserved. This is total swill."
1769,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.24,"Murky medium blonde forming a modest white head wit good retention. Moderate carbonation. Nose is dank with pine, grapefruit, pineapple, marijuanna, cat pee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit chewy. The taste is a recap of the aroma. Firm bitterness. I had this back to back with the green and honestly I couldn't tell the difference even with my eyes open. The smell, flavor, mouthfeel seemed the exact same to me."
1770,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.42,"This is a beaut of a double IPA, don't get me wrong. The thing is...I expected more based on how this brew has been extolled to me by people I trust and reviews here and elsewhere. It's a gorgeous looking thing to behold in the glass that's for sure. Banging juicy citrus and tropical nose up front with hints of ripe peach, crushed mango and wafts of piney resin. It's the palate to me that's just okay. I feel like this brew it tight. It doesn't open up like say King JJJULIUSS or Very Hazy. The juiciness is subdued and while I get the pine, the stone, citrus and tropical fruit notes in there, it's just restrained. Big full mouth feel is exceptional as are most of TH efforts."
1771,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.5,"Bottle poured into a snifter  One finger creamy brown foam cap , good retention, settles to a ring over dark brown liquid with numerous streams of micro carbonation  Fragrant bourbon aroma, borkum riff tobacco, roast malts , coffee,  Taste is bourbon, coffee, roast malts  Creamy , rich mouthfeel, low sudsing , almost syrupy, coffee taste lingers but not bitter  Good beer"
1772,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.0,"For the masses, there are three variants of Black Maple. There is regular, barrel aged, and double barrel aged."
1773,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.2,"Mostly clear gold, violent effervescence, with a massive, rocky white head that leaves webbed lacing. Distant chardonnay, just a little tartness, a hint of funk and some wood in the nose. Great white wine sweetness first upon sipping gives away immediately to some sharp brett coupled by some great funk and wood. It’s a funky-ass beer. Light bodied and almost pillowy feeling. To my preference, I’d love if the fruity wine character could hold its ground against the brett just a little longer — but this is still an excellent concoction."
1774,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,3.63,"Canned 12/19/16; drank 12/23/16 @ the Yarchives.  Opaque orange appearance.  A rough pour yielded a big white head; frothy lace.  Orange juice, mild dry grass & faint peanut butter notes in the nose.  Medium thick mouthfeel.  Sweet orange citrus & dry grapefruit flavors up front; a drying, bitter grass note on the finish.  Fruity, but the dryness overpowered the flavor."
1775,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.65,"Finishing out one of the best weeks of my recent life, right in the middle of this virus stuff. I needed to finish it right. I bought this at a bottle shop in Paris in 2014 that is no longer open. It was in my beer refrigerator since then.  Love this beer fresh and funky despite its age - you can almost feel the evening Belgian breeze. Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Cloudy yellow. Herbal, floral funk smell and taste. Slightly sour but fruity and refreshing. Strawberries, lime, leather, oak.  I hope to have more someday when this virus mess is over!"
1776,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.65,"12 oz bottle at share. Slick, oily pour. Super smooth. Boozy, chocolate, vanilla, roast, all blended to perfecton. Sweet, slick with a slight burn. Top notch."
1777,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.7,"Can. White head. Super hazy golden sunset orange. Looks like juice. This is one of trillium's best beers and one of my favorite NE DIPAs. It is so soft with no bitterness or burn. Tropical juice. Orange, pineapple, and mango. The wildflower honey must do something here, because the feel is incredible. This beer is way too drinkable for a double."
1778,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,3.58,"The concept of inundating a brew with ingredients may work in the world of IPA, but it does not (IMO) in the world of stout. The balance is lost completely. This pours like sickly treacle or motor oil and its so heavy bodied it drinks like sludge. Way too sweet. Yes, imperial stouts almost always knock your socks off with strength, but usually there are some understated flavors that carry themselves gracefully... this lacks all nuance. Its too much. American brewers are often guilty of being overly ambitious and pushing their brews too far away from tradition... this is a perfect example of pushing a stout to the point of being un-drinkable, to where it no longer is beer... and in that regard, it is successful. This is an ice cream topping."
1779,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.19,"16oz can, dated 06.29.2021, poured into a Tree House snifter glass.  The beer pours a very hazy and turbid orange color, amber hues with a foamy finger or two of white head that has very good retention and excellent lacing. The aroma is nice, lots of orange juice, mild grapefruit, wildflower, grassy hop, dank and earthy, moderate bitterness, sweet dough, mineral water, and light booze. The flavors are good, bursting with orange juice, wildflower, a bit of balancing tropical fruits, hints of peach and mango, a little green and grassy, dank, plenty of pale dough, sweet yeast, mineral water, and warm booze. The mouthfeel is good, coating and creamy, heavier medium body though not quite chewy and a soft finish that is lightly dry and somewhat warm. Verdict: A nice NEIPA from Tree House. It definitely has all the hallmarks of Julius, balanced, bright, tropical, and bursting with orange juice. The booziness of this one definitely comes through which is a bit of a detriment as it reads as harsh and mutes things a bit."
1780,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,5.0,"The ""lighter"" relative of the Westvleteren XII is equally tasty but not as aggressive, softening the sweetness and maltiness to create a beverage that can be consumed on any occasion. Like the XII it will bottle age and mature the flavor, in some ways making it less heavy. What I like about this beer is the fruity notes in both the aroma and flavor where the hops are noticeably only in reducing the sweetness and leaving no bitterness. A highly recommended beer!"
1781,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.43,"L: Hazy red coloured with a two finger white, soon gone head."
1782,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.84,"I don’t know why but I’m partial to the std Julius; this king version is fantastic and an awesome treat, but maybe just a tad overworked on my palate. Yes it is hopped but the citrus tropical notes come through clear."
1783,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.75,Poured from a 16oz can into a pub glass. Look is a hazy pale orange with a full white head.  Aroma is sweet mango tropical fruit.  Taste is pithy bitter tropical fruit.
1784,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,5.0,"Fantastic beer. Dark brown to black appearance. Aromas are of sweet cocoa/bourbon/maple stout. Flavors are same. Very sweet, but not cloyingly so. Super pillowy soft mouthfeel. Perfect dessert beer. Would certainly revisit this!"
1785,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.69,"Thanks Ryan for sharing a mini growler of this liquid. Poured into a tulip. Aromas are luscious raspberry-chocolate, vanilla-bourbon. On the tongue is just straight silky semisweet chocolate covered raspberries that are ever present but delicately subtle. Easy, silky body, very thick and rich.  This might be the best raspberry stout I've ever had.. kills BYR."
1786,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.94,Intensely hoppy American Pale Ale with a well-rounded bitterness that appeals to the American IPA fan that I am. 
1787,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.45,CAN
1788,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.3,"finally time for me to chip in my opinion on this website’s most reviewed beer. I actually got this beer unintentionally, i had bought a bottle of founder’s porter from mchugh’s in kilbarrack, but they were out of stock and sent me this instead, quite the upgrade indeed. this beer is very tasty, pours black as night, tan coloured head with quite good retention, big nose, lot of coffee and chocolate, this beer is super coffee forward, ground coffee beans, espresso, earthy, roasty toasty flavour, burned bread, milk and dark chocolate, nice balance between sweet and bitter flavours, body is creamy and light for a strong stout like this, but still medium to full bodied, some alcohol warming, a very nice stout from a very good brewery."
1789,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.71,"blend #2 had at 2017 Anniversary Party at the brewery tasting room 4.65  blend #4 update: 5oz pour into a snifter. murky dark brown almost black mahogany tinted pour. no head. smells of bourbon, caramel, toffee, chocolate, leather. taste is similar. both are immaculate but even better might be the mouthfeel. this is a vast improvement over b3. one of the smoothest, easiest drinking barleywines i’ve ever had."
1790,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.9,"12 oz bottle. Poured in Prairie stemmed glass. Looks great. Smells of rum and coconut...decadent. Taste is insanely good! Coconut, vanilla and rum. Amazing beer."
1791,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.79,"From a bomber. Pours golden. Smells tart, citrusy, only hinting at funk. Taste is exceptional: tart opening, laced with hints of honey, moves into perfectly balanced funkiness. The most nuanced wild saison, and just one of the top 5 or so beers, I've ever had. I live far enough from the brewery that a visit would require an overnight stay in the area, but this one made me start thinking of how to take that trip."
1792,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.25,Look- hazy yellow body with a 2 finger pure white foamy head 
1793,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.83,"Glad to cross this one off the bucket list. Shared at HF. Golden pour, baby finger sized white head, no lacing. Aroma of green grape, white wine, oak, apricot, white peach. Taste is something else, oaked white wine, apricot, peach, light cellar notes, white grape, hay, picking up a light honey-sweetness and very light funkiness. Lighter body, carbonation holding up pretty well."
1794,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.76,"First time having this brew, with a few other FFF offerings under my belt recently. Poured cold, hard to an IPA glass, Aroma is strong pine-esque (not citrus) hop with a bit of oaky vibe. Color is a solid dark amber, with some light carbonation. Head is a robust 2-3 fingers, that burns down to a tight ring. First sips are excellent...bold hop up front with an immediate balancing malt base. Has a slight floral hint along the mid and back palate. Loads of lacing cling to the glass. Very crisp and clean, but with a sense of heavy earthiness holding it up. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying. Alcohol has no burn, hides well, even after two pints at 10.5% ABV. These are delicious, and might even be better than their flagship Alpha King or the beloved Zombie Dust."
1795,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.9,"The beer pours a Clear gold with a medium frothy white head. It has high champagne like carbonation. The beer smells of lemon, cranberries, pears, hay, and damp funk. It tastes lightly tart, with cranberries, pears, red wine, hay, and damp funk. The feel is medium light, with some sweetness. This is an awesome beer, so complex and nuanced."
1796,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.5,"L - 1-finger dense hazelnut head never fully recedes, leaving behind a fuzzy layer atop a pitch black body. S - strong maple, a hint of bacon, and lots of bourbon. T - follows the nose. Sweet bourbon, wood char, salt, maple, a little coffee. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Moderate-low booziness. F - medium-full, creamy body with appropriate carb. O - damn impressive, and way too easy to dome."
1797,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.97,Growler fill poured into a snifter.
1798,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.29,"Pours a thick dark brown. Forms a finger of dark brown head. Nice creamy look to it. Good retention as well.  Nose is rich smoky malt, roasty coffee, and some brown sugar.  Taste follows as such. Malt and coffee presence is strong. Mild chocolate comes through as well. Some bitterness reminiscent of bakers chocolate.  Mouthfeel is fullbodied. Creamy even. Nice dense quality without feeling heavy. Mild carbonation.  A stout that excels because of its simplicity. Rich, roasty malt and coffee delivered with a smooth mouthfeel. Very enjoyable."
1799,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,3.28,"If this was one 330mL bottle, maybe I could tolerate it more. As is, the sourness affects the teeth and gives acid reflux to regret. Too much. "
1800,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.98,"This is the best beer I've ever had ... and this coming from an IPA guy. I bought a 4-pack on my way out of the brewery and tried my first one at a resort. I was on vacation, so my senses may have been slightly skewed but this is fantastic stuff, though not cheap. I tried about 5 or 6 beers on draft (not all full beers!) and purchased 3 beers to take home and this was the best, although the chocolate cherry cordial was close behind. The sweet sugary maple flavor hits you right away and then the bacon sort of creeps up on you. The coffee is an undernote, which is much appreciated. I find most coffee-based stouts go way over the top tasting more like week-old truck stop coffee forgotten and left in the pot for days. I love that the maple syrup and the bacon are the stars of the show and the coffee just kind of pops in like a sip of java here and there between breakfast bites. The beer mouthfeel is rather light but smooth and that scored it the only 4.75 ... it is brown-black and has a light head. As I was on vacation, I had no Tulip or Teku for this and instead used a stemless wine glass from the resort. Even still, the odor was a sweet and salty Umami blend ... you guessed it, maple syrup and bacon. I kick myself for not bringing more of this home in my luggage. This is the best tasting beer I've tried. If you are drinking for merely a buzz, probably not for you as I had two and did not feel much."
1801,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.41,"This is the best Berliner I've ever tasted, although this is coming from someone who doesn't really love Berliners. Bright color and outstanding fruit flavor, the guava really shines through. The best part is the finish though, it's perfect. Not too sweet, not too sour, not too dry. Just perfect."
1802,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.5,"a: silky jet black color, no light penetrates. looks like motor oil. thin tan film is all i'm getting in way of a head s: coffee beans, freshly round coffee, and roasted malts upfront. dark molasses, cola, vanilla, lactose, marshmellow, and peanut butter cup behind that. chocolate syrup and more coffee with vanilla ice cream to close this out t: taste follows the nose pretty well. sweet caramel malt, roasted malts, brown sugar, and chocolate syrup upfront. smooth peanut butter (not overpowering at all), lactose sweetness, and some charred oak behind that. freshly ground coffee, and a touch of bitter coffee behind that. sweet cola syrup and milk chocolate close this out m: heavy, sticky sweet mouthfeel with moderate carbonation o: dessert in a glass here, however it doesn't taste too heavy of adjuncts. it's sweet, but has some balance brought to it by the coffee. the peanut butter is subtle, and lends a nice accent. real nice sipper dessert beer right here"
1803,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,This is my #1 beer. The absolute best beer I've tasted. It really turned me onto Cinnamon in my stouts. The Pink Peppercorns and cinnamon are just great together.
1804,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.51,"From an 11.2oz bottle, date stamped 04 06 24. Served in a cervoise. Pours a deep, dark maple-brown with an enormous fat and pouffy head of foam insulation. It takes a good long time to get the whole bottle into the glass and, when I have, I could literally bite chunks out of the head. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick, foamy cap and gobs of bubbly lacing. Aroma is warm and inviting. Reminiscent of Grandma’s kitchen, whole grain bread, molasses, cookies and tea. Taste follows the nose, dense, under-baked whole grain bread, dark and yeasty, molasses and spice, dry wood and old tea bags. Ends with some toasty bitterness on the palate and raisiny, boozy, sweet currant fumes in the sinuses. Feel is soft and mouth-coating, chewy but no more than medium bodied - the denseness of the palate keeps fooling my brain into thinking it’s thicker than it is and then the very bright carbonation reminds me that it is not. Bitter and sweet, yum. I was sad when the glass was empty but at 10% abv it’s probably just as well."
1805,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.72,"Pours a clear golden color with a big fluffy white head which lingers for a while. There’s some sediment which drops to the bottom. Big tropical fruit especially pineapple, apple with pine, grass and hops on the nose. Taste is outstanding...well balanced sweetness on the front of tropical fruit with some dankness which turns to a dense hopslam of bitterness which isn’t overpowering but lingers. As advertised! Brilliant brew!"
1806,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.25,"Great looking and smells amazing. Taste is nicely tropical but a bit boozy and vegetal. Mouthfeel is warm, nicely bitter, chewy. While this beer improves as I get further into the glass, increasing my initial rating for taste, mouthfeel and overall by 0.25 each, I am a bit disappointed honestly, I wish the warmth and vegetal nature from the hops were absent. They decreased with time, but are still present. Though the beer is warm, it is still not hugely so, considering the ABV. Overall pretty good, but not better than the original King Sue."
1807,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.74,"From a bottle shared at la fête de la brasserie de la Pleine Lune 2019.  2014 vintage bottled in 2017.  Intense cristal ruby without any head.  The nose is powerful on the raspberry seeds, the dark raspberries and with little funk. The taste is perfectly balanced with a beautiful sourness, some funk and a strong deep raspberry presence.  The mouthfeel is dry with a nice carbonation.  The whole thing is a fruit lambic pushed to the corner made more powerful and more balanced than ever"
1808,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.26,Canned 9/29/20
1809,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.77,"Great hazy body with no real head. The aroma is on the fruity side; pineapple, and orange. Drinks really easily with a melange of fruit flavors like pineapple, orange, and mango. Good bitterness helps to firm the beer up and add balance against the sweetness. Medium mouthfeel with a juice like feel. Great beer."
1810,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.33,"2015 edition. Poured from a wax-topped 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip L: Inky black pour with a finger of mocha colored head. Solid lacing. S: Rich and roasty... big time cocoa , coffee, and grains plus bourbon/booze. T.F: Just like it smells. Loads or roasted malts and burned sugars. Vanilla/bourbon... dark chocolate, espresso, and chicory. Toffee and molasses with a bit of oak and earth. Dark fruit and a hint of licorice. Medium to thick bodied... warming... boozy but not as much as expected. Super smooth and creamy mouthfeel. O: An elite BBA RIS. Fantastic flavor... and a great sipper. One to seek out."
1811,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,"""Best consumed by 8/26/16""; drank 8/26/16 (!) @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Opaque orange/yellow appearance.  Nice bright white head; frothy lace.  Peach, orange citrus & pineapple notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Pineapple juice, peach & fresh spring water flavors up front; tangy mango & dry grass notes on the finish.  Perhaps the perfect expression of the NE IPA style. Bravo!"

1813,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.42,"12 oz can poured into a flute glass Very cloudy straw color, half inch white head Nose: Dominated by hops. Citrus, tropical fruit Taste: same as the nose. Very hop forward with citrus and tropical fruit. No malt presence Feel: Extremely dry and crisp, medium carbonation"

1815,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.72,"A snappy cracking head that produces a good head and decent lacing. A light burnt golden amber, quite cloudy. A quick initial fade slows down to a modest Nose is amazing malt, honey, funky brett and bits of orange. A lovely woody oak and light vanilla.  Outstanding taste. An initial sweetness is quickly enveloped by layers of mouth puckering sourness. Lots of brett funk, then mild malt notes. Oak flows into a pronounced juicy bitterness. Light fruits. Notes of vanilla and a soupy soupçon of honeydew. Dry finish Crisp light and effervescent. Dryness give it a thirst quenching character but this is a sipper. Not one to guzzle.  Probably the best example off the style I've had. Amazing. I'll be buying several more to enjoy and cellar."
1816,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.0,"Tasted this double barrel aged multiple times for multiple years. This is an excellent stout that I welcome drinking just about any time I'd like a stout. However, this is simply not a 100 point beer. I'm convinced that the score for this beer is the result of scoring by locals employing local hype. But, very good beer none the less."
1817,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,3.03,"Something has to have been wrong with my bottle. Poured like jelly, little to no peach flavor, no carbonation. An overall strange experience for sure."
1818,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.52,Can dated 1/18/19. Poured into Belgian tulip.
1819,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,5.0,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass not sure when it was bottled. Pours midnight black on a cloudy day evening in the dead of winter, with a 2 finger mocha head that hangs out a bit, clinging to the sides of the glass like a fat kid the last pudding cup in the house, leaving big thick streaks of lace. 5 Smell is one dimensional in the best way roasted expresso, vanilla beans, and cocoa nibs. 5 Taste follows expresso, vanilla, and deep dark chocolate. Sorry exactly what you would hope for and if loving this is wrong I don’t want to be right. 5 Mouthfeel is BIG, not dry, gentle carbonation, creamy, and at 9.7% insanely approachable.5 Overall this is just incredible, yes I am a easy grader but this is a perfect 5. I have given this score less than 10 times with my over 2000 reviews, and I would not change a thing! 5 Treehouse Brewery Fire!"
1820,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,3.77,"Tastes like burnt Vanilla Coke aged in gasoline barrels.  I love a boozy stout. I love adjuncts. And I like when they’re made with concern for tastebuds, not just for how extreme of a flavor they can get out of it.  Hard pass!"
1821,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.71,6 year old bottle poured into a Goblet
1822,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,3.24,"Thanks to joplamp for this one, from the recent can-cans BIF. 12oz bottle (packaged 5/18/200 poured into 14oz teku. Poured the expected solid black color, with less than 1/4 inch of tan head that quickly dissipated, and left no lacing. Sweet vanilla and bourbon at the front of the nose, with some oak, but the base beer flavors were very muted. Just a touch of alcohol heat. Very similar on the tongue, but the roast aspects of the base beer show a bit stronger. The body was thinner than I look for in the style, but was smooth, and had a finish that started sweet, but dried out after a few moments. Drinkability was good, no issues, especially for 13+% brew. Overall, a nice beer, certainly, but not one that particularly stands out from other examples of its ilk. Worth trying."
1823,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,5.0,"Completely by accident, I ran across this beer at a craft beer bar that I frequent - had never heard of Abraxas. Barrel aged imperial stout sounded like the kind of beer I like, so I got a small taste just to see if I wanted a full pour. Didn't take long to decide...in fact, I had a second pour because I couldn't imagine any of the other 99 or so taps could have anything this delicious. If you've had Canadian Breakfast Stout, and Prairie Bomb!, It tasted like a mix of the two. Absolutely delicious. Definitely World Class!"
1824,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.81,"A- Pours a beautiful golden hue, with hints of orange. A medium sized white head slowly recedes and leaves ample lacing. S- The aroma is gloriously enticing! Lemony, tart, with notes of soft cheese, and barnyard funk. Loads of granny smith apple! Beautiful white wine and oak character! Super delicate and complex! T- The flavor is superb and follows the nose quite well. Light tartness, dry white wine, mild funk, and lemon grass. Crazy drinkable and delightful! M- The mouth feel is incredibly soft, with a medium body and light carbonation. It finishes incredibly dry! O- This is a beautiful wine barrel aged saison! One of the best I've ever had, and it should be sought out for sure!"
1825,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.43,"Poured from the bottle into a taster. Bourbon, oak, some nice roasted malts and chocolate. Very well balanced overall, with a full bodied, solid mouthfeel. Well done beer!"
1826,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.23,"Picked up a 6 pack of this at the source in late October. What a fun day that was.  Pours a cloudy yellow with 1/3"" white head. Good retention for style. Has the nice Galaxy smell, pineapple definitely the most prominent tropical fruit note. Taste is easy like Sunday morning, below average bitterness, below average hop burn/acidity. Above average tropical fruit notes, still lead by the pineapple quotient. Malt bill is minimal and non descript outside of the normal parameters of pale malt, 2 row and flaked oats. Relatively soft mouth feel because of all that. 8% drinks pretty easy here. The difference in a decade between imperial ipas to now, so much different, less bitterness and alcohol burn to say the least.  Holy moly, look at that average score! While I think this is a very good beer, damn, there are literally more than a hundred double/imperial ipas that are just as good in California alone. Happy I got to try it, but if you haven't, don't feel like its some grail that has to happen, don't fomo this, you have something like it around you. With that said, still very tasty."
1827,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.74,"I know I'm supposed to drink it from the can... buuuut it pours a semi clear yellow orange color with a medium bodied white colored head that fades quickly but laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet roasted malts, a mix of earthy, floral, and citrus hops finish up the nose. Tastes of sweet roasted malts and then finishes of a nice mix of floral, earthy, and citrusy hops. It's somewhere in between the IPAs of yesterday and the NEIPA craze of today. It's crisp yet smooth, perfect amount of carbonation. Excellent beer."
1828,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.3,"Excellent beer. It doesn’t seem to have the flavor characteristics of other quads I have tasted. The spice is there, and sharp finish, bit the subtle esters I’ve tasted in other beers of the style seem to be not pronounced."
1829,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.74,L: black cannon fodder. Carmelly head.
1830,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.02,"330 cl bottle from Etre Gourmet. Pours a brownish/amber with a moderate head. Hits the usual dubbel notes of raisin/fig/malty caramel/hint of spice from the yeast - but also is surprisingly boozy and bitter. Overall, obviously I'm glad to have tried it but I will happily drink $5-6 dubbels from Chimay/Rochefort/St. Bernardus rather than spending $15 or so on this again."
1831,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.65,"Perfect pour from a growler, small fluffy head, lacing all the way down the glass, hazy amber."
1832,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.72,"2019 vintage, on draft at Toppling Goliath. I had this along with a draft pour of KBBS at the same time. The VB Assassin is definitely a lot different than KBBS, besides the adjuncts obviously. VB Assassin was pitch black with a bit of foam around the edge of glass. Aroma had loads of vanilla along with bourbon booze a bit maybe. The flavor was soft vanilla all the way with a bit of that now common Assassin dark fruit flavor serving as base underneath the vanilla goodness. Bit of chocolate-like flavors here too. Thick for sure though! Flavors linger for a while."
1833,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.63,"Hazy golden with 4 fingers of well retained white head. The smell is dank and weed like, herbal beauty. The taste is surprising and amazing. Totally unexpected soft berry, Cape goose berry, or golden berry.  As smooth on the palate as one can imagine. I got this in Chico, CA and am drinking it in Redding, Nov 25th, 2020. Amazing brew."
1834,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.85,Review 1585
1835,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.23,"Bottled 5/9/16 (""best buy 5/9/26""); drank 4/22/17 @ the Yarchives.  Brown/black appearance.  A violent pour yielded a small tan head; minimal lace.  Vanilla, rich milk chocolate, port wine & mild oak notes in the nose.  Smooth medium thick mouthfeel.  Rich milk chocolate & oak spice flavors up front; massive vanilla notes on the finish. Mild bourbon heat emerged as this warmed.  This was way up my alley as far as profile, but honestly the barrel aging detracted rather than added to the overall effect; I just wanted more of that chocolate vanilla goodness. Still very good."
1836,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.06,"Lots of licorice, herbal hops, roast. An old-school American imperial stout. Wet bourbon character, not a lot of barrel. good if you like something strong and bitter"
1837,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.81,"2015 B2. Had at apricot share with about 35 other apricot sours and siasons. Top notch apricot saison. Thought the finish is what separated it from other apricots. Great smell, and terrfic light airy, not that sour. I woulds say this and La Fosse B2 one the share for me. I love Fou but 15 was a little lack luster compared to westly."

1839,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.72,"Lovely orange and dense haze in the glass, with a thickish white head. Citrus aromas on the nose. Rich and lush on the palate, with a great malt backbone and lovely orange flavors from the Citra. A luxurious brew."
1840,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.48,"Dated 5/9/18 on the bottom of the can, 12 days since brewing. Pours a nearly opaque straw-gold with a finger and a half of compact white head. Aromas bursting out of the can as soon as I cracked it open. First notes of the nose are of spices; pepper, coriander and cumin. This is followed by ruby grapefruit pith, black licorice, honeydew and a selection of over-ripened tropicals (mango, apricot, pineapple). Taste follows the nose with the over-ripened fruit and spices, but also brings in some dankness, pine resin and pale grainy malt. Body is a smooth medium- with low dryness and a medium- hoppy bitterness. Another great IPA from Trillium, perfectly balanced and smooth, Great blend of hops that give mix of pungent spices, tropical fruit and hoppiness."
1841,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.25,"Appearance: Dark brown bordering on Black The beer has has a fairly small dark brown head which faded to a ring. Smell: Moderate Bourbon notes, coffee followed by brown sugar notes. Taste: The Bourbon, coffee and brown sugar notes from the nose come through in the taste profile. I also get some fairly noticeable oak notes, and roasted malts. The finish is fairly dry.  Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied with a modest level of carbonation appropriate tor the style. Overall: A good bal-aged Imperial Stout."
1842,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.55,"Got a bottle of this when I was in northern California about 3 /12 months ago visiting my best friend and we went to Russian River's new location. This has a bottle date of 5/22/2019. Poured out of a 12/68 oz. bottle into one of my tulip glasses, this beer pours a pretty clear, fairly light/pale golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles rapidly and continually rising to the beer's surface. Has a very carbonated looking, white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that eventually settles to a thick, creamy looking, layer of surface foam along with a very thick ring of foam surrounding the inside of the glass. Good lacing here too. Aromas of some bready malts, yeasty esters, and Chardonnay oak along with some Brettanomyces funk notes that's all rounded out with just a hint of lactose. Flavor wise, this starts out with some bready malt that gives way to oaked Chardonnay white wine grape that has a nice tartness upfront that gives way to some yeasty funk and sourness, both from the grape and also from what seems to be some lactose as well as far as my tastebuds are concerned. All the flavors are balanced and compliment each other superbly. WOW!!! Has fairly crisp, also smooth, dry mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Also has a dry finish and aftertaste, and the sour funk really coats the inside of my mouth and my tongue nicely after each sip and lingers for quite awhile after each sip. Another outstanding American Wild Ale beer from the fine folks at Russian River! Eric"
1843,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.92,"2 pours from different bottles onsite at Hill Farmstead. Batch 5, 375 ml. This one pours a mostly clear light yellow, with a small head and lots of lacing. This smells like grassy funk, candied lemon, chalk candy, oaky white wine, stone fruit, lime, and Brett. This is honestly exceptional. It's so dry and remarkably complex, with lots of little complexities. There's lime and stone fruit, smarties, white wine, spicy oak, vanilla, and grassy funk/hops. This is creamy and tart and tangy, with a high level of drinkability. This is nearly as perfect as it gets for the style."
1844,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.25,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2017 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, coffee, molasses, licorice, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, coffee, molasses, licorice, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal, roast, char bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark/brown bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roast/hop bitter/sweet, and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/char bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1%, with minimal barrel booze lingering after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic BBA imperial porter! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Amazingly rich/well rounded malt complexity and maple syrup presence; with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy on barrels. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected."
1845,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.3,"Appearance: poured pitch black. Appeared slightly thin while pouring and with no presentable head.  Smell: heavy aromas of maple. Almost intoxicating with notes of pancakes. Coffee is kind of hard to pick up, likely due to overpowering maple. There is a slight mocha to the nose. Overall very sweet and robust.  Taste: sweet sticky maple. Just a touch more bitter than I expected. Coffee a little more noticeable with is slight char and roast, yet the maple still dominate. There's also bakers cocoa and notes of caramel throughout, adding a little more complexity.  Mouthfeel: little sticky. Maybe just a touch more thin then their other stouts I have tried. Overall: an excellent brew, comparing to TG Mornin' Delight, Double Stack is a little less robust and maybe could amp up the coffee or tone down the maple to add balance."
1846,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.45,"Sep. 2016 Batch. Says to drink within 6 months. Oops. At least I kept it cold. 500 mL bottle poured into snifter and let warm. L: Pours completely dark with 1F tan head with good retention. Leaves no lacing, but persistent cap and ring. S: Bourbon barrel, honey, coffee, and roasted malts. Always odd to have honey and coffee together, but it seems to work here. T: Man this is good. These flavors shouldn't work together, but they do. Coffee and bourbon barrel up front and then honey comes in and persists through the finish. It comes thisclose to running away with it and being too sweet, but stays on the good side. You also get some dark fruits and orange peel up front and in middle. Lots going on here, really. F: Full-bodied, obviously. This drinks like the ABV is significantly higher than listed here (there is nothing on the bottle). Not much in the way of carbonation. Construction just dead-reckoning perfect, balance fantastic.  O: Well, wait are you waiting for? Jump in your cars and hope they have some at the brewery (I think this is a fall release)."
1847,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.66,"Bright orange, sticky head. Smells like sweet orange, mango, pineapple, and dank hops. Tastes are the same as the scent with a great balance of sweetness from the fruit flavors and the bitterness from the hops. Nice creamy mouthfeel and hidden alcohol. Great beer."
1848,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.02,**
1849,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.23,"Expecting a bit more from this one. I expected the booziness given the 10% ABV but seem to be lacking in the aroma department. I enjoyed Abner earlier this week much more. Nonetheless, this is still a great beer. HF continues to produce high quality beers."
1850,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.64,"L - black body, two fingers of dark brown head S - SO much chocolate. Coffee, caramel, marshmallow T - Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate. Marshmallow Fluff, Cherries, black coffee F - Soft and fluffy O - Perfect dessert beer."
1851,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.75,"Batch2 from the bottle release today. Look is opaque light orange. Smell is light funk at first, eggy, then heavy apricots as it warms. Taste is amazing. Sour then apricots all over the place. More apricots as it warms up. Dry finish. Wife and I have had almost all of the fruited sours and this is by far the best we've ever had from Side Project. They really hit the nail on the head with this one. This beer explodes apricots all over the place. Really really tasty."
1852,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.4,Pours yellow opaque into the glass with a thin head. Light citrus and mango on the nose. Taste is similar without an overpowering hop bitterness. Definitely one worth chasing after.
1853,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.42,"Excellent cloudy bright yellow body; head is very thin and wispy, lasting with a bit of foamy fingers clinging to the glass. Beautiful aroma of freshly squeezed orange juice. The taste brings an outstanding presence of biscuit and light bread crust base with subtle citrus highlight; rather mild orange; strong yet balanced bitterness; some boozy notes; lemon bread. heavy body; creamy; some appreciable alcohol heat; dry mouthfeel overall, deftly counterbalanced with soft background of sweetness. My can was packaged 04/28/20. I don't know if a fuller head would normally be expected from this beer, but if that is all I have to gripe about, well, it's not much to worry about in the grand scheme of beer tasting. The balance, depth, and complexity of the beer is otherwise phenomenal."
1854,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.91,"Pours a cloudy golden color with a huge, froth head. Smells very promising and complex - the nose is filled with dried herbs, lemon zest and a note of orange juice, as well as white bread dough and wet hay. There is a cookie sweetness coming from the hay, which gets almost entirely swallowed by the tart lemon presence, but manages to cut through. A whiff of old basement, together with some wooden mold establish a fantastic counterpart to the bright fruitiness. Has a soft and light mouthfeel, which got a well nuanced sparkly, mineralic carbonation to it, which becomes most present during the finish, lending a well deserved refreshing note to the beer. Tastes of ripe wheat, which gets immediatly overpowered by tart lemon and juicy orange, together with a slowly evolving herb dryness of mint and oregano, which turns even more prominent in the finish. Maintains a very pleasant, mellow mouthfeel, which gets complimented by a sparkly, well dosed mineralic carbonation, adding to the dryness. Its cookie sweetness from the nose, together with some subtle blue cheese funk, create a wonderful complexity, which does not distract from the lemon at all. That is an incredibly well made, complex and tasty beer, it is mindblowingly good. All aspects come together in perfect order, enriching each other, balanced by the fantastic mouthfeel."
1855,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.25,"First SP fruited beer. La Fosse is fine, pretty good even, but it suffers from the overwhelming amount of acidity (reminded me of Upland). I definitely don't think it's worth what it trades for. If you want Apricots, I think nearly every other similar beer is much better (Aurelian Lure, Apricot Bu, Apricot Fruit Stand, Fou Foune, West Ashley, etc)."
1856,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.34,Poured into a snifter. Nearly opaque dark brown with a frothy tan head. Decent lacing in the glass. Huge chocolate and fudge on the nose. Faint soy sauce as well but it worked. The palate followed closely followed. Thick and tasty with no off flavors. Highly enjoyable but not sure it is at whale status.
1857,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,3.4,"First, I was struck by the lack of head on the beer. Then, it was lighter than some of the other beers, but the after-taste had a certain bitterness."
1858,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.64,"Review 5000, holy Shit, never expected to get here, a huge number, incredible. Bottled 8/04/2004, don't remember how I got this Pours light fizzy head that fades fairly quickly, hazy orange slight amber color, and even has good lacing. Nose is incredible, basically the epitome of everything good about gueuze, some horse blanket funk, cheesy funk, big tart fruit, sour acidic funk, aged lactic acetic acid, an acidic citrus grapefruit, kiwi berry fruit, aged funk, just yes! Taste is very tart, tons of grapefruit rind, super bitter funky fruit, big farmhouse funk, horse blanket, cheesy funk, big vinous grape skin, tons of funk, great gueuze typical Drie Fonteinen at its best. Finish is dry big funk, little flemmy and acidic, fruit, grapefruit. Mouth is med to lighter bod, lighter carb though, typical acidity flemmy Overall just ridiculous, I'm so glad I got to drink this. Wish I could make this into a candle and candy to smell and suck on all the time."
1859,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.5,"Tan head. Black color. 2018 vintage. Raspberry tootsie pop dipped in bourbon. Fudgy with raspberries and other berries showing. Light tartness, but not anything that makes it not stout like. On point with backyard and bramble rye. Full bodied. Really enjoyable."
1860,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,5.0,The Gold Standard Gulf Coast IPA 
1861,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.59,"Palette explodes with rich dark chocolate, dates, vanilla, marshmallow, dark berry reduction, molasses, leather, tobacco, seasoned firewood. Coconut is incredibly well integrated and gives an unobtrusive oily backbone. Could be a Jordi Roca Mounds bar riff, but even that would be a short-changing of Fremont. Phenomenal"
1862,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.48,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a stemmed tulip glass. Pours a hazy orange color with 2 fingers of creamy white head. As with most Hill Farmstead beers, the retention on the head is real, leaving a crown of lacing as it ultimately settles into a thick blanket of foam. Gorgeous as always. The aroma is dank and pungent. There's a ton of overripe mangoes, melon, guava, papaya, and white wine grapes. Lots of pine and danksauce on the back end.  The flavor follows the nose. Very dank and earthy up front. What can only be described as coriander followed by mango, grapefruit, orange, papaya and grape skin with a strong cracker malt backbone. Unique, but great. The feel is medium bodied with soft carbonation. Very smooth and creamy with the expected dry finish.  Overall, another fantastic single hop IPA from Hill Farmstead. Whether it's a pale ale, regular NEIPA or double IPA, no one does single hop beers like Shaun Hill. This one is earthy and dank, yet extremely tropical and having that signature grape note that Nelson hops often bring. So, so good."
1863,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,5.0,This beer is awesome! Smoother than regular Black Tuesday. Does not taste like 20% whatsoever. The blend is what sets this beer apart though. Rich thick stoutiness with excellent barrel aged flavors. Thanks Bruery!
1864,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.71,"look: Dark brown, cola highlights when held to light. Modest tan head with messy lacing."
1865,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.59,"Unknown vintage; drank 8/13/15 @ Tap House Grill (Seattle).  Semi-opaque orange appearance.  White head; a curtain of lace.  Mango, apricot & strawberry notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Strawberry, mango & apricot jam flavors; surprisingly, no booze heat.  Amazingly fruity & easy to drink. DIPA heaven."
1866,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.56,Another coconut bomb for sure. Not artificial tasting at all and would love to get my hands on more if I have the chance. Hoping they distribute this up here soon.
1867,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.49,"Medium gold beer with a light haze and a few fingers of ivory white foam... 3/21/18 canning... One can produced a lot of chunky sediment, while the other did not despite being from the same batch... Go figure... Anyway, fantastic brew - right up my alley: a DIPA coming in at 8.5% abv featuring the mighty Mosaic hop and raw wildflower honey... Soft and smooth and fruity, with honey imparting a richly flavored sweetness to the floral, tropical, and orchard fruit impressions... bitterness is very mild, in the typical NEIPA style, although this was not a fruit smoothie sort of IPA, as it did have a very subtle hint of dank resin buried under the soft ripe fruits and honey. Really dug it..."
1868,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,5.0,"Had 2013 Great. This is the best barley wine I have ever had. So thick and tasty, with great caramel taste. Great heavy thick smell. This barley wine changed how I felt about barley wines."
1869,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.72,"This one pours a nice looking brown/ruby with a thin head that breaks into a cap and collar. The cap doesn't last long, and the collar leaves some minor lacing in its wake. The smell is divine. Sweetness leads the way, with brown sugar and dark fruits. Then you get a touch of barrel notes, and it finishes off with mild hops. Taste is like the nose, being led by the sweetness. in spite of a strong sweetness, there is a nice balance with the barrel notes, which is quite subtle, and then the hops finish. This is a real enjoyable sipper. Feel is full with lower carbonation. There is a sticky coating finish to this one, and the sweetness lasts. While I can only assume a high ABV this is a well hidden aspect. Wow, what a great beer. I mean this is top ten for me. Such a beautiful sipper, I was very sad when it was all gone. The flavors are so nice, and they meld so nicely. If you are a fan of English Barleywines run, don't walk, to try to get a bottle."
1870,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.04,"16oz can dated 3/19/19. Pours murky gold with an inch of white, whipped white head. Retention is good with dense lacing. Pithy citrus in the nose but subdued. Hints of grapefruit and hard peaches. Medium bodied with a chaulky, chewy mouthfeel. Grapefruit pith with bitter citrus skins on the palate. Finishes with plenty of bitter pith and minimal malt. Certainly my least favorite Treehouse so far."
1871,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.1,Pours amber golden a little chill haze but fairly clear. 
1872,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.21,"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Tree House snifter glass; canned on 11/18/20, code THIS IS THE WAY."
1873,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.19,"16oz can, dated 05.20.21, poured into a stemless wine glass. The beer pours a nice orange color, amber hues, very hazy and cloudy with a firm finger of white head, moderate retention and nice lacing. The aroma is pleasant, dank and weedy, lots of grass clippings, pine, grapefruit peel, pineapple juice, orange juice, wildflower, sweet yeast, mineral water, and pale dough. The flavors are good, grassy, a little herbal, fairly floral, piney, resinous, green and earthy with melon, pineapple, orange juice, grapefruit peel, hearty dough, mineral water, and sweet yeast. The mouthfeel is nice, coating and creamy with a lively medium body, on the heavier side, that finishes easily with a dry bite. Verdict: A nice NEIPA from Tree House. Bright, tangy, earthy, fairly juicy, with a distinct Tree House minerality and yeast profile."
1874,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.89,"It's pretty perfect. The barrel delivers, creates multiple tones of creaminess, boozy, balanced, some years are better than others, but all around a must try!"
1875,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.71,"Tasted from can. Pours black with beige head. Aroma of sweet milk chocolate and vanilla. Taste is creamy and sweet. Lots of milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and coffee. Top notch milk stout."
1876,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.67,"Notes from a recent bottle share. Per my notes, ""fruity as hell on the nose."" The nectarines are crazy juicy and strong with some light tartness and a decent dose of dry oak on the back end of the scent. The pour is your basic Side Project fruited sour pour, light a fizzy with little to no lacing or head. This one is a beautiful, full golden to moderately light orange in color. On the tongue this one stings with a strong sour right up front. The tartness is quickly subdued a bit with the emergence of great nectarine fruit flavor. The stone fruit is still tart, but juicy as hell to go along with it. The back end mirrors the back of the scent with a very drying, oak tartness. The fruit lingers on the tongue well after the drink has ended. Just like the scent being typical Side Project, the mouthfeel is as well. It is highly carbonated and sticky with the fruit on the palate. Overall, this is probably my favorite of Cory's fruited sour small bottle series. It is sour of course, but not so bracingly sour as to outshine the fruit addition. If you like any peach/apricot/orange sour beers, this beer if definitely for you."
1877,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,5.0,"2021 version on draft at the Rev taproom. All the great aromas of caramelized dates, leather, sweet raisins and maybe some vanilla. Lots of barrel notes but exceptionally smooth with a long sticky finish. World class for sure."
1878,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.58,"Pours pitch black color with 2 finger foamy light brown colored head that faded very slowly and left excellent thick foamy lacing coating the glass after each sip. Smells of fresh brewed coffee, ground coffee beans, espresso, burnt coffee grinds, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, hot fudge, brown sugar, molasses, bakers chocolate, brownie batter and faint piney notes. It is rich smelling with so much chocolate and coffee that they battle for attention.  Tastes like it smells but a tad bit sweeter, with dark chocolate, fresh brewed black coffee, espresso, cocoa powder, ground coffee, bakers chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, milk chocolate, vanilla, a chocolate ice cream shake with hot fudge and Hershey's chocolate syrup, roasted nuts and chocolate milk. This is more chocolate than coffee in the flavor, which is the opposite of the aroma. It was incredibly smooth drinking with a creamy texture, mild carbonation and very little alcohol bite, all while staying complex and not crossing over to cloyingly sweet. I love coffee beers and this was another treat from Tree House."
1879,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.58,750 ml. bottle.
1880,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.76,"Goddamn, thanks for the pour Darren! This one pours dark black, with no head or lacing. This smells so strongly of sweet toasted coconut, high quality dark chocolate fudge, bourbon, and vanilla. I get a lot of vanilla from the barrel here, it's so creamy, like cake frosting on this decadent German chocolate cake. There is just a ton of coconut here, none of that sun-tan lotion garbage- authentic, toasted coconut, slightly sweet, with a really nice deep dark fudgy character. This really does approximate German chocolate cake quite well. I've had the base beer before, and the barrel-aging just brings this beer all the way to completion. This is thick, creamy, and velvety, with still a high level of drinkability despite that. I almost don't want to like Bottle Logic, but I kind of have to. They make some absolutely baller pastry stouts."
1881,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,5.0,"The perfect beer. Don't drink too cold! Once it warms up / reaches ~50F it opens up and balances perfectly. Tons and tons of fruit in the nose. Super jammy, starts as a sour, when warmed opens up as a saison. Fantastic brew."
1882,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.54,"Pours black with tan head. There's some barrel aroma, vanilla and booze. It really is super balanced, delicate, and well finessed. The honey seems to subdue the barrel character or at least keep it from being as heavy handed as some other BBA stouts. There's some chocolate in there too. It's super smooth to the point where the bourbon punch is a pinch. BoT is just a phenomenal porter."
1883,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,5.0,
1884,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.38,"11/17/18 (Chicago): 2 oz 15.0% ABV pour at 2018 FOBAB into taster glass. Dark brown pour, puffy tan head, leaves nice lacing, very good looking pour. Balanced aroma, chocolate the most prevalent with a hint of cinnamon. Malt has light roasted coffee aroma, rye whiskey well masked. Exciting bold taste, chocolate, cinnamon and very smooth rye whiskey worked great, very balanced offering. Nice creamy smooth mouth feel. This was a great offering, glad I had a chance to sample my first Dark Lord, this variant is an excellent offering and I look forward to trying future Dark Lord offerings."
1885,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.58,"Has anyone ever said, “I cannot wait to drink this glass of what looks like boiled motor oil?” Well motor oil comes out of the container looking more like an IPA so that adjective (oily) never seemed correct. Dirty motor oil, I guess. "
1886,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.98,"Figured if I was gonna solo a bottle, the least I can do is write a little something Look: Not the darkest beer ever but pours with a good head and the bottle has one of the more elegantly designed labels imo.  Smell: The smell is true to the name with chocolate and coffee featuring prominently. Smells like an understated mocha Taste: I immediately taste loads of chocolate but before it becomes overly sweet it is balanced by strong coffee notes and then I think I detect some dark fruit notes as it finishes smoothly. This bottle is only ~3-4 months from bottling but the alcohol is on the 12-14% level by taste which is astounding as always Feel: I just had Abraxas 2 days prior to drinking this and I think that the mouthfeel that perennial puts out is just completely out of this world. If I hadnt just had a perennial stout this would be a 5 but clearly mouthfeel could be improved since maman + variants exist Overall: Favorite weekday beer so far. Looking forward to trying PB Thursday"
1887,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.75,"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a small tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with no lacing. Based on the pour this one seems pretty low in carbonation,"
1888,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.13,"L: A dark brown to black with a reddish hint at the fringe. A near equally dark half finger of fizzy head that disappears quickly and leaves no trace. S: Primarily fudge but some earthy roasted peanuts in there and a dark fruit tart note. T: Follows the nose. Mostly fudgy but the tartness, while I expect it is coffee, is coming off as dark cherries in the way you pick this up in a Belgian Dark Ale OT black ale. A little more Eastern European and not my thing. Very sweet - nearly cloyingly and not balanced by enough bitterness. F: Syrupy and a touch oily, with a heavy medium weight. Could use more carbonation. Still inline with many of the same style. O: Personally shocked that this is ranked #2, with all the other amazing milk stouts that Tree House has made, I would put several others at that ranking over this."
1889,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,3.51,"Batch 2017. Bottled splited 4 ways. Very pale golden slighlty hazy liquid with a white head diminishing fast. Shy nose, winy, white grape, slight funk, tartness. Taste is quite disappointing, light body, light floral taste, some citrus sourness, white wine, I lot of hype around this one that I think doesn’t deserve it. Florence in my opinion deserves more respect for the taste vs price."
1890,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,5.0,"I couldn't have been more impressed with this beer. Loved the sweetness from the maple and the spices came through very well. Of the Cakes I've had, this is 2nd to the Double Barrel version from a couple years ago but not far off at all. Would be happy to try this one again."
1891,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.85,Almost a full 5! Extremely complex with all kinds of fruit/spice/earth. No adjunct beer but lots of aging in barrels. Bravo! Enjoyed a bottle at the brewery in tillamook. 2019 vintage!
1892,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.8,"Used motor oil black with a short but intensely dark burnt mocha head that fizzles out quickly to reveal a few brown floating speckles on the surface. I haven't had a pastry stout with floaters in it for a minute! The nose exhibits insanely luscious chocolate fudge brownie batter with a deep characteristic of softly gooey vanilla bean sabayon and hints of coconut pudding accented by cinnamon peppered barrel.  I'm tasting German chocolate cake that is more forward of fudge and rich vanilla cream elements, but sweet yet savory coconut adds accents throughout. Here again on the palate, the barrel adds a unique flame-awakened cinnamon sort of character that is quite unique, and actually brings forth a semi-bitter charred oak aftertaste. Fairly viscous thick, its fine yet cutting carbonation brings a little heat with it, lifting a touch of stinging peppery whiskey back up the esophagus. Leading up to that mature finish is a decadence fitting of a celebration, and on this day it was indeed quite the celebration for us, 2 years post craniatomy."
1893,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.58,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a perennial wine glass. pours the color of ruby red grapefruit juice with some soapy white head which dies down to form a white collar around the glass. smells of fresh plums, lemons and grapefruit plus oak and a tinge of white wine. it has a much livelier acidic nose than most HF. taste is citrus and plum with lemon and oak. not really sour at all. refreshing and super easy and enjoyable to drink. mouthfeel is full with a nice amount of carbonation. not overly so but enough to give it a lively spritziness. overall, the best fruited flora i’ve had and one of my favorite HF saisons."
1894,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.75,"Enjoyed side by side at a share with Beer: Barrel: Time. My expectations were sort of turned on their head as BBT was the clear loser between the two... and for some reason, I'd expected Maman to spiced in some way. Not so. Maman features a very nice, prominent display of barrels. It's also very sweet and had a pleasant, rich nose and mouthfeel. It's a delicious beer, but one that doesn't lend itself well to casual drinking. That should probably be obvious - but by the time I was done with Maman, my pallet was a bit wrecked and ready to move on to something a little less intense. It's still well-balanced and delicious - but it's an intense experience. Don't sleep on Maman (it was my second favorite of the evening in a big, big whale share), but don't expect the world of it either."
1895,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.52,"Bottled 6/19 Poured from Cellar temp on 3/20  Pours a peach with a white fuzzy head. Nose is pure Nectarine and a little dG funk. Taste follows the nose - nectarine up front, some dG funk, and oak, mild acid on the back. Feel is crisp and light, clears the palette well, good carb. Overall this is very fruit forward with a little of the traditional dG flairs. Not their most complex beer but sure flavorful!"
1896,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.75,"Look: The beer pours a cranberry juice color. Light pink head that leaves no lacing, but a thin film across the top of the beer and a thick ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Crimson. Dark, but translucent. No visible carbonation.  Smell: Sweet cherry pie. The fruit compote and flakey crust. Slight cherry acidity. Cherry skin. Floral aromatics. A slight mustiness. Flares of manure seem to come and go. Touch of melted plastic.  Taste: Upfront the beer has a cherry sweetness and manageable lemon acidity that hits the tip of the tongue. As the beer washes over the back and sides of my palate the two cherries truly fight it out. Cherry pie sweetness competes with bracing and gritty cherry acidity. All natural flavors. It reminds me of randomly pulling a sweet or tart cherry from the plastic container and being surprised. You get both here. The finish is very dry, and as the beer lingers on my palate I get some C. Howard Violet Chewing Gum. Quite floral and a bit powdery. A faint hint of herbal, earthy bitterness on the very end. Mouthfeel: Carbonated, but softly. Feels highly carbonated but the sting and bubbles dissipate immediately. Fluffy on the palate.  Overall: This beer is delectable. One of, if not the best cherry sour beer I’ve had, alongside Belgian comps. Very happy and satisfied with the chance to have finally tried this beer. I submit that this beer is a world class example of the cherry sour ale."
1897,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.42,Thank you TimG_0913 for this
1898,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.93,"Thick, black pour. No head, negligible carb. Smells like rum and coconut... taste is similar, with a healthy dose of chocolate. Big body, just dripping with flavor, but composed perfectly. Outstanding"
1899,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.5,Pours a hazy orange. Full hop aroma. A explosion
1900,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.27,"Canned 7/14/20. The lyrics to Queen’s Don’t Stop Me now stamped on the can which gave me a good chuckle Another one from the mixed case I grabbed the other day, but this is my first time trying this one Pours a murky pale gold with 3 fingers of seemingly everlasting white head and leaves nice lacing Huge notes of orange and vanilla, backed by dank piney hops, pineapple, mango, and crisp malt The start of the sip brings bright citrus and tropical fruits, mostly papaya and mango. After the swallow, the dankness is dialed up to 10, tasting straight up weedy and grassy, more bitter than I expected but it’s a wonderful hop profile to balance out the creaminess Medium full bodied with very soft carbonation, this finishes off dry and sweet, which seems to be like most of their IPAs. Creamy and refreshing This was damn solid. It didn’t blow me away, but it was still really good. Got a few more cans of this but I suspect they’ll be gone soom"
1901,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.77,"This was a long time want, generously shared by Shyne. 2009 vintage. Drunk in May 2012 to get warmed before the epic Sour&Bitter festival. Reviewed from notes."
1902,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.87,"500ml bottle sent to me by a friend that works at RR. Poured out a clear, golden amber color with a good-sized, rocky head of foam. It smelled dank, fruity, piney with a caramel sweetness. Orange and grapefruit taste with a sharp piney bitterness. Rich caramel and toffee backbone."
1903,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"Side by side at a killer whalez share, this was incredible.... can't rank anything equal to Bake Kujira but this is definitely in the top beers I've ever had. Huuuuuuuge body - thicker than any body with no adjuncts that I've ever come across, barrel so well integrated into the chocolate-forward base. It's the best non-adjunct stout you will ever come across and was a completely different monster from that of a fresh 2016 Assassin, we had right before this one."
1904,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.91,"12 oz can, born on 11/6/2020, poured into a snifter at 55 degrees F:"

1906,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.65,"Pours jet black. No head, very little carbonation. Aroma is dominated by the bourbon with a bit a vanilla. The taste is amazing. A combination of strong bourbon flavor, chocolaty fudge with hints of vanilla and malts. Mouthfeel is medium. Incredible stout."
1907,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.99,"Pours a jet engine oil dark body with a mocha-hued head. The cacao and spice come aromas are strong, along with the booziness from the brandy and rum barrels. The taste is like no other stout I've had. Brandy and rum blend together nicely to add some complexity to the richness of the nibs. The chiles and cinnamon are very noticeable as well, but are balanced out by the chocolate and alcohol so it's never too overpowering. The chocolate and vanilla thicken this beer, and the heat of the chiles and brandy/rum leave a nice heat. Phenomenal beer that deserves the praise it's received."
1908,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.27,"L: Dark gold color with a good amount of off -white head. The lacing is crazy on this thing, it clings to the glass for days."
1909,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.43,"Pours a hazy glowing golden color with a fresh white head.. Smell is tropical,fruits berries,melon and earthy notes. Taste is fresh citrus with pineapple ,melon and passion fruit ,super fresh. Mouth feel is soft smooth and pillowy with medium carbonation ABV well hidden a fruity and not so dry finish. One of the better DDH 2IPA’S I’ve had."
1910,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.39,"Served in a snifter glass from a bottle. Aroma- Limited coffee, mostly bourbon Look- Black in color, medium brown head with some foam retention  Taste- Roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon Feel- Full body, somewhat sticky texture with decent carbonation Overall, really well made stout, smooth, and well balanced with awesome flavor"
1911,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.5,"On tap at the recent HOTD fredfest event. The beer pours a somewhat murky orange chocolate brown color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose, it's apparent this has seen some pretty serious barrel aging, as I pick up considerable vanilla, caramel, light bourbon, molasses and light coffee. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this sweet, rich beer, and I appreciated how well integrated the alcohol was in this beer. You can definitely tell the abv. is up there, but I would never have guessed 17%. The sweetness wears on your after a bit, so a little bit goes a long way, but this is otherwise a very impressive BA barleywine from Anchorage brewing. Mouthfeel is very full, soft and long on the palate.  Excellent beer for sure, and one that reminded me very much of the Fremont Brew 1000 from a couple years back. Not as much bourbon as the B1000 I suppose, but pretty similar otherwise. Definitely a treat to see this fine beer at Fredfest this year."
1912,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.23,Bottle courtesy of acurtis. 
1913,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.33,"Black in color with no penetration to light. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering nearly all of the top. Moderate lacing. The aroma is of smoke, roasted barley, molasses, and figs. I’m tasting smoke, roasted barley, tobacco, and leather. The mouth is dry, oily, and assertive."
1914,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.36,"Poured from 750ml bottle into Chimay goblet. L - Hazy apricot pour. thin to non-existent white lacing. S - Brett, stewed apricot, wet straw/grassiness. T - Tart, grassy, vaguely salty, hops on the back. F - Juicy at the start, dry finish. Finely carbonated, but not stinging. Complicated, but well balanced."
1915,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.55,"Orange with a cream-colored, large head with lots of little bubbles wanting to waterfall over the edge of the glass. Opacity is somewhere between clear and cloudy. Head settles down quickly, light to moderate lacing. Nose is pine, melon, peach, citrus, grassy notes. Big flavors...there's grapefruit, mango, pine, mandarin orange, peach, lemon, and a sticky honey sweetness.  Body is medium, the carbonation lending an aggressive and tingly feel which matches and complements the intensity of the flavors.  This is exceptionally well done. Would buy this regularly if I could. 96"
1916,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.37,"Having had all Armand'4 last week, plus various other 3F goodies, I was curious how i would feel about a 2010 LPG this week. Looked beautiful clear and gold, poured with moderate carb and a bit of head. Smelled like tart Cantillon, rather sweet and a bit fruity. Taste followed suit. Delicious tartness, a bit more tart than apple cider. Perhaps some wine barrel. I didn't find it as bitter as the classic bio gueuze. Fairly sweet and the mouthfeel was incredible - had nice body and quite sufficient balancing tannins. But...very little depth or funk. Found the drinkability high, but the complexity lacking. Perhaps, as others have stated, it needed more time. I plan to never open a LPG this young again (I believe it was the 2013 bottling of the 2010 vintage, opened July 2016)."
1917,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.26,"To me this will always be the beer that started it all. Delicious, dark cherry and cinnamon taste. Perfect carbonation and mouthfeel. Tried it with some older folks who never had a craft beer before and they were sold!"
1918,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.56,"drank from 12 oz can poured into tulip glass, a little over 4 weeks old--- no sign of weedy old hops, still very fresh tasting....delicious brew---nice balance of upfront fruitiness, pineapple mostly w a little grapefruit, followed by balancing mellow bitterness...Nice!"
1919,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.6,"Cutting Tiles (mosaic) pours a hazy, golden honey color with a well formed, tight knit, one finger head that sticks around. The smell is backed by a big floral note and juicy citrus fruits with a scant sweetness. The taste has an excellent mouthfeel, soft and smooth over the palette with citrus and tropical fruits shinning through. There is a rich sweetness from the wild flower, raw honey and just enough hop bitterness to balance this double out."
1920,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.56,"Poured from a bottle (2018 vintage) into a sort of chalice (2020 BBT glass)  L: pours a dark caramel brown with a mild dark khaki head that fades after a bit less than a minute. Abv-appropriate legs  S: tons of dark fruit, sweets, some abv heat but not much. Get figs, raisins, dates, dried cherries, toffee, caramel, dark chocolate. A rich but somehow lighter nose, not overpowering and certainly not cloying. Fruit notes and caramel led right out of the fridge, chocolate coming out more as it’s warmed T: follows the nose well, great fruit with a good amount more chocolate than the nose. Rich notes of raisin and fig open, with waves of dark chocolate close behind, those cherry notes as well. Get less of that caramel/toffee sweetness on the swallow than the nose suggested. That dark chocolate/baking chocolate comes through very well, builds and carried through the long finish. A moderate bitterness that I figure is combination of the hops working off of those chocolate notes. For the abv this is very drinkable - no burn, some warmth F: medium- body, medium- carbonation. Don’t have much barleywine experience but this fits what I know - drinkable, lighter body with a bit of heat O: still getting aquatinted with barleywines but this is certainly delicious. Bold aroma with a swallow to back it up, rich fruit with a combination hops/chocolate malt bitterness"
1921,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.52,"poured from a 12oz can into a willi becher pint glass. pours a hazy, milky orange with a thin layer of head. smells of grapefruit and a bit of pine. taste has strong grapefruit flavors with some piney bitterness to back it up. feel is heavy, lower carb and full. this really is alcoholic grapefruit juice in a can. it doesn’t get overly fruity though as the combination of hops compliment each other to a balanced and citrusy yet dank & resinous DIPA."
1922,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.24,"Murky medium blonde forming a modest white head with good retention. Moderate carbonation. Nose is dank with pine, grapefruit, pineapple, marijuanna, cat pee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit chewy. The taste is a recap of the aroma. Firm bitterness. I had this back to back with the Haze and honestly I couldn't tell the difference even with my eyes open. The smell, flavor, mouthfeel seemed the exact same to me."
1923,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.25,"Bottled 4/8/16; drank 4/21/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Opaque yellow appearance.  Small, noisy white head; strong lace.  Pineapple, mango & faint ganja notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Pineapple juice flavor up front; dry grass & soda water bite on the finish. No booze heat.  Refreshing & simple; this would be perfect on a hot summer day."
1924,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.75,"This beer is very interesting. I would say that from Side Project I prefer Smooth and from Casey I prefer Family Preserves Peach, but this is still very good. Maybe a touch too acidic, but I'm not going to complain."
1925,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,3.48,"Deep cloudy orange with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of orange cream soda, lemon skin. Tastes of orange cream soda, grass, lemon skin. Heavy body with light carbonation."
1926,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.34,"375 ml bottle from December, 2016. Obtained in a trade. Hope it's still good as it certainly was well cared for. L: Maybe 1F head poured into Behind the Veil Teku glass. Not much retention, no lacing, only a thing ring. Beer is a very attractive clear deep copper. S: Definitely getting a lot of the wine barrel (guessing chardonnay) and brett. Some grapefruit and lemon, maybe. T: Tart wine and wine barrel up front, with slightly sour citrus in the form of lemon and grapefruit along with the brett. Intense flavors, for sure, so the name is apt. Still has a spicy crispness even with some age, so I'm guessing the taste is as intended. Finish does linger despite the crispness and it comes close to running away on the tart side. ABV not really evident. F: Light to medium bodied, mediumish carbonation. Crispy but palate doesn't dry completely, allowing for a long tart finish. Good construction. O: Would like to try fresh for parallel tasting, but for now this falls a tiny bit behind Brother Soigne on my list of HF Saisons. As always, I believe the water is what makes all of their offerings so good."
1927,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.31,Slightly opaque golden yellow with 2 fingers of course chalky white head. Fruit is very apparent on the nose along with some back ground funk. Taste is dominated by minerality but the apricot is apparent on the back. Moderately sour that works extremely well with the fruit. Very clean finish.
1928,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.3,An OG and one of the best go-to bourbon-barrel aged stouts out there. I have had 2016 - 2020 and all have been solid. My wife likes these as well!!!
1929,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.6,"750ml bottle, 2017 release. Bottling date of 08/16/18 etched on the neck of the bottle. Bourbon and oak dominate the nose with more moderate notes of cinnamon and peppers. The smell definitely gets better as it warms with the bourbon barrel notes dominating and also the cinnamon, chile peppers, and cacao nibs that make the regular Hunahpu’s so amazing are hiding behind the barrel notes. The taste is all the great flavors of Hunahpu’s with a slightly spicy and warming finish."
1930,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.25,Look - very high carbonation and a clear pale yellow/straw color - stays quite active. Smell - decent amount of funk from 'spontaneous fermentation' - slight vinegar hint. Taste - pretty powerful blast of sourness and tart fruit - slight yeast and bread - some malt - mostly sour but backs off and other flavors come through then. Feel - medium bodied (which is a bit fuller than a typical barrel aged sour) and stays at a higher level of carbonation than expected. Overall - this is a great beer - I picked up this bottle in the original R.R. tap room in March 2019 - not as sour as I expected with a spontaneous fermented beer - a bit more complexity in this one as well - very enjoyable
1931,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.72,"Pours a hazy orange with thick, fluffy head. Smell is juicy and clean with notes of mango, pineapple, oranges and orange sorbet. Taste is juicy and soft with notes of mango, peach, pineapple, citrus and a floral hint. Soft, but distinct bitterness and remarkable balance. Some sweetness on the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect, soft, pillowy and well carbonated. Overall, a truly outstanding beer, regardless of it being an APA or IPA."
1932,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.26,"Pours a nice translucent ruby red. A finger of rocky head appears and quickly fades. Nose is strong flowery fragrances with tart raspberry and cherry underneath. Like a garden of flowers and fruit. Taste is definitely more complex. Getting cranberry now, almost overshadowing both raspberry and cherry. The tart and funk strong initially but quickly fades to a savory note almost. Reminds me of the aftertaste of olives. Very interesting. Getting very mild notes of oak. The finish is smooth and graceful. No flavors lingering and overstaying their welcome. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. A really good sour. Don't think I've had a Flanders Red, so I'm a little out of my element with this one. This one would be great with a nice meal. Perhaps a steak dinner or chicken marsala or chicken cordon bleu. A nice treat."
1933,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.71,"Enjoyed at the SP cellar. Nice treat for a tourist. A. Hazy golden color - similar to the base Foedre. Moderate but gentle carbonation that slowly dissipates to a coarse head. S. Sour MO bugs on the front. Major notes of neutral oak, nectarines, and lacto.  T. Moderate to high level of sourness - similar to the base. Sour bugs are dominate but give way to a nice balance with the nectarines. Mild oak. Not extremely complex which serves it well. M. Super smooth, tart, light body, moderate carbonation. O. Very impressive fruited sour. Nice balance. Great flavors. Nice sour kick - Highly recommended. It is fairly simple which certainly works in this situation. Nice structure from the base combined with a balanced addition from the fruit."
1934,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.07,2017 bottle 10/5/17 - drank 7/26/19
1935,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.49,"750ml waxed bottle, served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pours a darker brown body, one finger offwhite head, one finger white head, good retention, nice lacing. Smell is rich caramel, earth, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanillin. This is very much the barrel-aged barleywine. Flavour follows, heavy oak, caramel, toffee, vanillin, oak, slight earth, nice complexity, fairly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, nice toffee and barrel on the finish. A very nice and heavy barleywine with a lot of sweetness; it doesn't seem to offer more oomph than say, Revolution Straight Jacket for example. I feel like this is a bit overhyped despite this being an excellent barrel aged English Barleywine."
1936,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.04,"16 oz can, dated 7/11/19, been in my fridge since then hazy, mostly opaque medium yellow color, foamy white head. aroma is nice well rounded fruity hop aroma - orange, papaya, mango. taste is similar, somewhat sweet, but with an underlying medium bitterness. medium bodied."
1937,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,5.0,"Hands down the best stout I've ever had. Might be a bit biased because I had it while at HF and in a perfect scenery but the mouthfeel is unbelievable. As silky as can be, plus the nose just bursts with coffee notes. Glad I was able to get this vintage bottle on site."
1938,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.35,Color is prune juice or really murky apple cider.
1939,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.68,"Poured a few oz for a look, hazy yellow pour, decent white head which dissipates quickly. Aromas of citrus, tropical fruit, mango. Taste follows with a nice layer of that dank grassiness I got from Heady. Weedy tendencies here that I don’t mind at all. Excellent beer!"
1940,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.63,Got this in a trade last winter and have been saving it for my birthday. Worth. The. Wait! Wow! Perfect BBA Stout. The bourbon is present but not overwhelming. Wish I had more than just this one!
1941,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.73,"2013 vintage. Honoured to share this with JLindros in honor of his newborn son. Review 2800. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice slightly hazy blueberry juice hue with a light pink head that fades to leave sticky lacing and a thick blanket.  S - Aromas of incredible blueberry, berry skin. Excellent light funk, basement and cheesy funk, soft lemons. Really really fragrant.  T - Taste is similar to the nose, tons of blueberry skin and tannins, loads of funk, cheesy basement. The acidity is nice, but the tannins are a bit too over powering.  M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, crisp, very clean with a good funk.  O - Overall this was a very good lambik. Excellent blueberry notes with really good funk. Excellently crafted.  Serving Type: bottle"
1942,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.62,"Alan, I cannot thank you enough for this bottle.  375ml bottle - 2018 vintage - poured into a wide tulip at 44°F.  Pours a clear, yet ever-so-slightly foggy true gold hue, with all but a loose ring of white foam forming, that sticks around permanently. Some lazy effervescence is visible.  Nose: In classic Hill Farmstead form, the aroma is beautifully delicate and fragile, beginning with subtle notes of malt and wheat, with a rustic sort of grainy note about it. Atop this, gentle acidity and beautiful minerality act as a conduit for a melange of bright vinous fruits in the form of lemon, pear, apple, nectarine, white grape, and gooseberry, and then this subtle, yet spectacular dark fruit note that is quietly jammy, sweet, and plummet, almost evoking a hint of grape juice and grape pixie stix. Finally, threads of oak, hay, grass, attic, leather, parchment, wet moss, and petrichor stitch it a together. Absolutely spectacular.  Palate: Immediately, the defining notes of the base beer - Florence, are beautifully showcased here, rounded by maturity. She greets the palate with the most restrained acidity with a hint of lemon-lime, and then that unique floral, fresh coriander-eucalyptus note peaks through. Bright fresh fruity notes of pear, gooseberry, white wine grape, underripe plum, and tart plum skins all play together, surrounded by a racey, vibrant minerality that sparkles over the palate. There is a subtle thread of funk, lending damp earth, moss, hay, wet oak, white grape pomace, river stones, and a whisper if dusty brett, before the lemon-lime and exotic fruity floral notes resurface. A slight minty/camphoraceous element cools the palate, and then the oak comes in to dry out the fruity bits. Flora Plum finishes dry and clean, with a faint hint of grain, and zero acidity.  Mouthfeel/Body: Delicate, light, and crisp, yet managing to avoid being watery or lacking in any way. Perfect gentle acidity, which is complimented by a zippy, sparkling minerality, and lively, but delicate effervescence. Perfectly dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness and plum-skin tartness. Subtle drying oak, and as clean as you could imagine.  Overall: This is a truly spectacular farmhouse ale. I thought blueberry was divine, yet I believe this exceeds it - and I'm a sucker for blueberry. It's just so delicate, elegant, and tasteful, while truly conveying all the character of Florence, softened by oak and time, and delivering this subtle, but beautiful fruity plum influence. There's a reason this beer is so highly revered. Practically flawless, and utterly Hill Farmstead."
1943,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.08,"Quite sweet - maple tastes just a bit granular and overly saccharine. But, it tastes natural all the same. An odd conflicting mouth-experience. It's just a bit thinner than I'd like, but drinks very easy. Barrel isn't all that present, if at all - my palate had trouble discerning any wood, bourbon, or dryness. It's just sweet! A good beer, but up against the likes of Canuckley or Mornin' Delight even, this beer doesn't really shine. Again - good, but showing some age."
1944,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.18,"Opaquely hazy yellow-orange with a fluffy, lumpy white head that displays good retention and clings in ridges. The medium full body has a firm carbonation that brings a not unwelcome but decidedly stronger than usual bitterness of citrus rinds, also accompanied by some mild booze. In a way it's still well balanced, particularly by some herbal dankness and a little white pepper, but still, this is the most syrupy, woody and resiny IPA I've had by Hill. Just before the semi-dry finish, some mango, Cuties and pear characteristics surface. It's solid, to be sure, but not even close to my favorite Hill IPA. That this is the highest Hill beer on the Top 250 is beyond me."
1945,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.65,"A - Pitch black and motor oil viscosity, huge tan head that continues to cling to the glass the entire long journey. S - Vanilla, charred okay, bourbon, caramel malts, maple syrup, toffee, cocoa nibs. Smell gets better as it warms up.  T - Loads of decadent chocolate, cocoa nibs, bourbon, oak, pure vanilla really comes through. Really an amazing and truly world class beer. You need to savor every sip on this bad boy. O - A work of art from the look, nose, and each sip all the way through."
1946,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.86,"Really wonderful. Nice golden pale orange in the glass, minimal head. Smells great, like a nectarine peach orchard, deeply savory, almost like bacon. Tastes so great, just beautifully bright and tart and like eating a nectarine, incredibly juicy, so rich and savory, feels amazing, I could drink this endlessly."
1947,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.43,"Picked up a 12 oz bottle from the Craft Beer Hop Stop7-24-19 for $12.99. No bottling date visible. Consumed 10/7/19. Beer poured black and with an aggressive pour a nice tan head materialized before dissipating quickly. Nose is light roasted malts and an ample amount of coffee, some vanilla, and a faint trace of bourbon. Taste is very well balanced between roasted malts, chilies, coffee, chocolate, and a kiss of bourbon. Hopping and adjuncts are just to the right degree to offset the huge sweet malt base. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very smooth. Overall this was a fun splurge. The bourbon and chili help balance the sweetness of the huge malt base very well. IMHO this is a one and done given the ridiculous pricing as there are many choices out there anymore."
1948,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,3.92,"Pale yellow-orange with a fuzzy white surface leaving random fluid arms of lace. Smell is blue cheese, wood, funk, hay, and lemon. Taste is tart lemon with a nice frothy crispness, as well as really sour grapefruit, with a semi-dry finish, but also a little stickiness."
1949,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.53,"Abricot Du Fermier, Batch #3, is beautiful. It's what you hope for based on its name. Glowing bright yellow, smooth and even soft looking. A fluffy white cloud is perched above the bright sunshine from below, and it's making me thirsty. Cracked wheat and an acidic sour aroma is complimented, not overpowered, by wonderful levels of oak and the star of this show, the sweet, juicy apricots. Cut grass, hay, and more sunshine, as if wet wooden panels are being steamed by it in the morning. It's complex, yet beautifully simple. And the flavors are even better. I can almost say they are identical, but the texture must play a factor here as it is velvety soft, and carries them remarkably. Everything you could ask for in a rustic wild Saison. Tart, but not puckering, light, but not something to guzzle, and full of all the right flavors of wood, hay, wheat, bread crusts, barn funk, and in this case the simple introduction of apricot. This is a delicious beverage. One that I never even knew I wanted to try, but couldn't be more excited once I laid eyes on this bottle. I knew it was something special, and it is. I want more. If you can get it, consider yourself lucky and do so. Cheers."
1950,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.29,"Dark black, decent tan colored head. The initial aroma is delicious maple syrup covered pancakes, wow. Flavor is sweet syrup and chocolate, tasty. Actually it tastes like candy a bit. Almost picked up a tad of bitterness on the end. Nice."
1951,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.58,"Awesome beer, very reminiscent of HF Sue--one of my all time favorites.... Nice Funky Saison with citrus and grapefruit bitterness on the finish, with a kick of dry hops, very concentrated and delicious!"
1952,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.5,"Pours pitch black, quite viscous and thick. Great chocolate aroma accented by some coffee and coconut. Tastes great. For 15%, it isn’t as sweet as I thought it would be. Loads of chocolate, sweet vanilla, light coffee, heat is light in the background, rum barrel aging works some coconut into the finish. Full bodied and delicious, a little pricy but worth trying once... 10/12/19"
1953,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.65,"look: amber to almost full black, very foamy,  smell: banana and cacao and the refreshing Belgium smell taste: intense chocolate and banana - which is super awesome! with some iconic Belgium taste that I don't know how to describe, also some cherry and raisin and toffee! feel: not that great, too plain, as if all the air has go away overall: awesome quad! and it's a little pricy, I got it $19 for 4*11.2oz"
1954,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.52,"Pouring this from a 22 oz. bottle into a snulip glass, this beer pours out like a dark brewed coffee, with little wood like highlights running throughout. It forms a thin crown of bubbles that are khaki in color and dissipate quickly. 3.75 The nose carries a stinging bourbon before even putting my nose to it. Putting my nose into it brings it with a more toned definition. There is freshly cut coconut mixing with brown sugar and that warming bourbon with a kiss of dark fruit. They achieved a very natural coconut; no suntan lotion smell. 4.75 The taste brings in the brown sugar just tangling with freshly toasted coconut all the way through. Slight milk chocolate, but just as an accent. It’s almost like a coconut pie drizzled with some chocolate. The bourbon is there with some dark fruit accents, but they didn’t let this stray too far away from what the base is. 4.5 The mouthfeel is smooth and doesn’t have a bourbon burn to it, just a nice, balanced warmness to let you know it’s there along with a dryness from the barrels. I would call it medium bodied. 4.5 Overall, this didn’t stray far from the base at all (despite the almost double ABV) but did add a new dimension to it with a few nice layers. After having this and Morning Wood last week it makes me wonder how long they age these in barrels. I would guess minimal aging (3-5 months) just because the way they are more accenting than anything. Which isn’t a bad thing to me, but just doesn’t morph the beer like you’d guess. 4.5"
1955,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.45,"A 2018 release packaged in a 500ml bottle. While filling the teku halfway, it is a viscous stout that produces a fairly frothy, brown head that not only has great retention, it never disappears. There is a constant film on top that tapers up to a thicker, cap sized ring around the glass.  First thing I can smell is definitely cinnamon. Tequila is also noticeable. To me it seems more like a white tequila because I tend to think it gives off more gin like floral notes. Otherwise there is a hint of a sriracha like pepper sauce, and chocolate.  Wow. The flavors really pop. A bit of tequila (aged this time) up front followed by chili peppers that deliver way more flavor than heat, but just enough bite to offset the sweetness and play off the, by far most dominant, flavor of cinnamon that is there throughout. It rounds off into a cocoa powder like chocolate with a touch of smokiness and lingering baking spice. As it warms, there is some vanilla in the finish too. Very nice combination of flavors. My only knock would be the sweetness starting to creep up the ladder as I make my way through it.  The body stands out the most. Which was the case for the very first beer I ever had of theirs. I said at the time that they were in the league of Bourbon County and Firestone Walker. Lush, velvety, and significant, yet so easy to drink. There is some tingling from the peppers.  Personally, I think that a touch more heat would put this right there, if not ahead of Mexican Cake for the best spiced stout I have had, but it is definitely at a level that it should appeal to everyone."
1956,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.91,"The one and only time I've made the pilgrimage to Alpine Beer, this was on tap. I had no idea what it was and in hindsight I consider myself a lucky man for being able to drink a pint of this my first time there. I will absolutely be on the lookout for when they tap it again. Absolutely incredible IPA."
1957,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.25,"11/17/18 (Chicago): 2 oz 14.1% ABV pour at FOBAB into taster glass. Black pour, thin tan lacing. Malt, chocolate and coconut aroma, whiskey faint. Chocolate and whiskey the predominate taste, light coconut, balanced. Creamy mouth feel, smooth. Overall very good offering!"
1958,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.54,"Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a hill farmstead bulb.  Pours a deep black body, pretty viscous with a dark brown head that reduces slowly to leave good retention and lacing that sticks around for a while. Heavy bourbon and dark chocolate aromas, cocoa, molasses, caramel. On the tongue there’s a rich medley of what I’d describe as dark chocolate hot cocoa with sweet marshmallow, oaky bourbon, fudge brownies, heavy roast on the finish and follow through. Moderately sweet, velvety rich body, low carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer. It opened up more as it warmed it. Perfectly balanced and complex, easy to drink and indulgent."
1959,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.63,Quarantine bonus! Armsby Abbey in Worcester selling growlers to go of this legend. Pours hazy dark orange. Creamy mouthfeel. Pine hits me first then subtle citrus. Fantastic dry DIPA.
1960,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.51,"A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap S: Big citrus up front along with some lighter floral and tropical notes T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a wave of citrus and tropical fruit, followed by some lighter floral and melon notes. Light bitterness. Finishes with lingering citrus and tropical fruit M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. On the softer side O: A very good DIPA that still sneaks in a bit of bitterness behind the citrus and tropical waves. Not sure how or why this is (listed) over 100 IBUs or why it would want to be? It’s extremely hidden if that’s the case, so I’ll ignore it. Too easy to drink. Definitely worth checking out"
1961,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.49,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a perennial wine glass. pours a burnt orange. it’s somewhat hazy and has like a cider look to it although not quite as dark. smells of dank hops, oak, white wine. taste almost has a belgian spiciness to it. i get the hops less here than on the nose and the oak seems more prominent. mouthfeel is full. it has a lower level of carbonation than one might expect from this style. overall, it’s a good beer for sure. in the HF canon it’s not at the top for me but still a very enjoyable beer."
1962,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.5,"Who's rating these things? A 99? Come on now. Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream -- that's a 99. It is excellent. Space Diamond is really good. I've had about 8 other Other Halfs. Those other 8… average. No need as far as I'm concerned to get into the details, just head into these giant ratings with a bit of skepticism. It seems like if the ABV is high enough, the rating is less stringent. I mean this beer is fine. It's not objectionable in any way, but it's just an average higher-ABV DDH sweet Hazy NEIPA. Add it to the pile. Don't give it a 99. My can was less than a month old, so it's fresh."
1963,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.93,S: seeet chocolate and coconut cream with a touch of rum
1964,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.76,"Pours a deep flat orange color with a bit of sediment at the end of the poor. Head was thick and bright white. Nose fills olfactory senses with citrus overtones, but none specific. Taste was juicy with a bite of bitterness. No wonder this beer continuously scores 100"
1965,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.65,"P: Deep light brown. Large head which half dissipates  A: Never much. Slight bread and a sweetness.  T: Sweet bread. Raisins. Melted Molasses M: A little thin, but thickens up at the smooth as shit. backend. As it warms fills out and where the good stuff happens. Sweet brown carmalized sugar.  O: Always a great beer and a pleasure to drink. It’s hard to compete with a classic Belgian style with all the specialty malt usage nowadays. Will be forever be a great beer"
1966,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.49,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a pleasant blend of bourbon and coffee. Taste is a smooth coffee and bourbon blend.
1967,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.45,"Really vibrant hop bomb, feels much closer to a west coast ipa than NEIPA, incredibly drinkable, lives up to the name. Great beer. Citrus, white grape, sweet malt, earthy, dank, nice hop bitterness. Crusher."
1968,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.64,"2016 bottle. Pours black with beige head. Huge caramel, hazelnut and cocoa aroma. Taste is still a little boozy but good for its ridiculously high ABV. Lots of hazelnut on the flavor with molasses, caramel, butterscotch, cocoa, bourbon. Delicious huge beer. Definitely a sipper."
1969,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.81,"Poured from a can (02Apr2021) into a Tree House teku #properglassware L: pours a darker orange with a huge slightly off-white head. Fades after a couple minutes, leaving some great lacing as it does. Very green vibes for sure! S: the nose on this is out of control, from the second I cracked a can. Huge waves of enticing tropical fruit, overripe and rich. Get mango, pineapple, great citrusy notes that also provide a bit of bitterness. This just a fruit-forward monster, sweet but balanced and awesome. One of the best noses I’ve encountered in a while T: follows the nose extremely well, man this is world class imo. Tons of rich fruit leading, with a great bitter finish that demands another sip. Serious mango, freshly cut and dripping, with that pineapple/tropical mix close behind. There’s a great citrus note (pithy, acidic) that works so well with that excellent finish, unlike anything I’ve encountered in a NEIPA of late. Sharp and drying, medium+ length F: medium+ body, medium carbonation, nicely drying and just demanding another sip O: I mean, this may unseat Very Green as my favorite TH brew/favorite IPA. The nose is other-worldly, this flavor is great with a remarkable finish - I honestly can’t think of how this is beat. Amazing!"
1970,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.93,"07/2016 - 2015 vintage - This is a perfect, non-adjunct stout - wow! So fudgy, rye, rich cocoa nose; luscious mouthfeel that lingers for days, plus some light smoke, super roasty, lightly bitter, wee toffee, and some vanilla on the back of the palate; negligible booze, roast, dark chocolate, whiskey on the finish. Blown away!"
1971,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.49,"poured from a 500mL bottle into a willi becher pint glass. pours a deep black with mocha colored head that settles into a thin film on top and leaves lacing as the beer is consumed. beautiful looking beer. smells chocolatey and smoky with a hint of hops. taste is similar with a dry, hoppy finish. feel is decent, especially so for a porter. overall, fantastic rendition of the style and extremely flavorful and drinkable for such a dark beer."
1972,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.46,Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. 2018 vintage.
1973,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.22,"Obsidian black, with burnt motor oil brown edges at a closer look, and very minimal visible carbonation, but for a thin dark mocha ring that dies to a silky surface fairly quickly. Smell is potent of cinnamon toast and Red Hots, and lesser of vanilla nougat. The medium to thick body has a crackly fizz that firms up and brings out a more dusty cinnamon than on the nose, while the barrel is splintery and adds some heat to the peppery sassafras of the oak that gives a hint of cola at times. Cocoa dusted dates comes out of the semi-dry, warming finish, as rounding chocolate and a smoky char continue to develop over top of the mild to low presence of spicy chili peppers. Having this side by side a bottle regular Abraxas of the same year, the adjuncts seem like they have ten times the potency here by comparison. It's also not quite as thick or viscous as the BA Sumps I've had."
1974,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,3.8,"This is from a growler, so unfortunately I’m not sure if it pops like the original. Like, there’s no way this beer is a 99 Gretzky style if it tastes like it does out of my glass right now. It poured hella thick like a girl that doesn’t quit, so I was into that. Aroma was ok. A lil spice, but also a lil frigid like a penguin on his morning walk. Taste is ok, but it falls off pretty flat like Paris Hilton during an IQ test. The feel also has a lil too be desired.  Personally, I’m going to rate this one as is, but I think if I buy a bottle it will be better."
1975,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.77,"2017 vintage. I won the lottery! Then we all got our money back! Kane is ridiculously awesome for doing that. For the record, 1 of my 5 bottles ended up with the surge problem. Still tested the same great taste. So this is Morning Bell, which I love as is, with maple syrup, cinnamon, and chili.  L: 2F tan head with moderate retention. Leaves little lacing, but a cap and ring. Beer is jet black. S: Coffee, dairy lactose, cinnamon, maple, cocoa explosion. Just off the hook. What perfect scores were made for. T: Generally speaking, follows nose. Coffee, cinnamon, and roasted malts up front, cocoa and maple through middle along with creamy dairy, and slight chili heat in finish along with some burned malts and caramel. Full of flavor. F: Medium to full bodied, not much carbonation. Construction superb, balance of all these things strong, but tiny dock for heat lingering maybe longer than it should. O: Just ridiculously good and Kane deserves so much credit for or how it handled this year. And now to find Sunday Brunch to complete the journey."
1976,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.5,Very solid gueze beer. Pours orange with a white head of foam. This is an unadulturated lambic beer and is truly a pleasure to drink this beverage. Honts of citrus as well and very crisp.
1977,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.72,"2019 vintage purchased recently online from HOTD. One beautiful thing about beer with no carbonation, you can swirl and sniff as much as you want without affecting the mouthfeel. I could not keep my nose out of the glass, I did more sniffing than sipping. Aromas of smokey wood, vanilla, honey, chocolate, and booze soaked fruits, apple, cherry, figs, and grapes. Maybe a little marshmallow in there too. All of it mellow, unobtrusive, and seductive. Tastes almost as good. Sweet, but with a lot of layers. Chocolate cake batter up front quickly joined by cherry and apple notes. The finish adds honey, vanilla, and a wonderful smokey bourbon note. So much more going on here beyond my ability to describe. The body is sticky and thick. Overall this was a unique, magnificent treat, gonna need more."
1978,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.31,"2018 release.  A: Pours a very dark, chestnut brown with a half finger of sand-colored, foamy head. Decent retention, receding quickly to a long-standing ring. No lacing.  S: Dark chocolate, vanilla bean, oak, with light roast and cola. T: Prominent okay presence from start to finish, providing some structure and cutting directly through the sweetness endemic to regular BT. Also, dark chocolate, roast, vanilla, cola, and plum. A long oaky, slightly tannic/roasty finish. More roast than I remember in regular BT. M: Moderate and assertive alcohol heat without the burn. Full bodied with medium-light carbonation. O: An oaky version of BT. Certainly an interesting take. The lower sweetness is an improvement, but the oakiness is a toe over the line."
1979,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.44,"At last, I got to try this one. The hallmark of this one is the complexity. There are layers upon layers of sour fruit, wood, mineral earthiness, dank funk, and acidic fruits. The smell is a fruity horse blanket, with plenty of musk and funk to go around. Carbonation is a little high, but otherwise wonderful in the feel until the very acidic finish, bring the tums. A well made beer that stands the test of time"
1980,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.75,"Had a cellared bottle. Been hunting this one for awhile, and it did not disappoint! Smell has rich bourbon barrel character that compliments all flavors. The booze, wood, coffee, chocolate, slight vanilla, licorice, leather and charcoal in the smell. Taste is much the same, woven together in rich creamy layers. Add some earthiness, dark fruit, and molasses, and notice the depth of the coffee flavors, and the taste is complete. Feel is creamy, super rich, the right amount of booziness, and chewy."
1981,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.75,"Deep amber with a surprisingly thick, white head. Smells like coconut, caramel, oak, a hint of tobacco and a not so subtle hint of whiskey. Tastes is sweet, like raisin sweet, but not at all cloying; like a fine sherry. Thick and sticky, but easy to drink. One of the best."
1982,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.83,"This was a truly delicious and nicely dry and tart Lambic. Look: dark red, slightly purple, with a one inch off-white head Aroma: cherry, citrus, oak.  Taste: tart and dry cherry followed by a little bit of yeasty funk and oak barrel as well as delicious citrusy bitterness. Body/Overall: light to medium body"
1983,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.67,L: Sunburnt orange and goldenrod hues with an ample white head
1984,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.31,"Bottled on 5/22/20 Pours a translucent, deep golden orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, rocky white foam; a spectacular head retention, nearly beyond reproach, yields a mountainous cap along with a fluffy, soapy collar and wild smattering of chunky, soapy lacing. Aroma opens with a tropical twang of tangerine and orange oils before moving towards a progressive, dank sweetness; floral and delicate across the middle, notes of mango and papaya add nuance to an airy, clean malt backbone as a platform for an ultimately delicate and prodding piney edge, dirty hops, and bitter citrus toward the close is established. Taste features tones of grapefruit zest and pine needle upfront, with light pineapple and mango developing steadily; fresh grass and a raw hop tone meshes with melon rind, lemon zest, and peach on the back end, even displaying a soft creaminess evolving and lingering past the swallow. Mouthfeel has a medium body, pillowy slick with hop oils, and a moderate-high carbonation peaking beautifully through the mid-palate; a semi-crisp flow refreshes the palate over time while paradoxically inviting a steady intensity of hoppy grit and ultimately, a soft, lingering bitterness easing into the finish. Exceptionally rounded and fervently balanced, the purely plush hop expression is partly simplistic (though satisfying), and partly an exploration of the essence of these softer flavors; an ultra-harmonious brew that nears the pinnacle of IPA approachability."
1985,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.28,"Appearance - The beer poured a very dark brown color with an off white head.  Smell - The beer had a big bold roasty color.  Taste - The initial taste was the big bold malts accompanied by coffee. Toward the back, there were nice hints of burnt sugar and perhaps caramel. The malts stayed strong throughout  Mouthfeel - The beer was smooth in mouthfeel with tiny carbonation bubbles.  Overall - This is a really nice porter, but I don’t really think its a Top 250 beer."
1986,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.44,"12 fl oz bottle sealed with silver pressure cap. bottled on 10/10/2015. poured into HF wine stem. Appearance: Opaque golden bodied beer with an orange hue. 1 full finger of white head. Head drops down to a thin cap and eventually no head at all.  Smell: Great nose on this beer. Big white wine aroma. Juicy hops just like the name implies.  Taste: Very white wine forward; white grapes, lots of oak, and lots of white wine tannin's. Light tartness. Light bitterness from hops; melon rind, lemon zest, lime zest, green apples, and pineapples. General fruitiness from the hops as well. Earthy character from brett most likely. Hill farmstead's signature funk is present. Lots of nuances and layers here in this beer.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low carbonation. Finish is moderately dry and this easily makes up for the low levels of carbonation. The beer does feel a little heavier because of the low levels of carbonation, but the beer also saw extensive time aging in wine barrels (two years according to the label).  Overall: Glad to have finally tried this beer. Been a long time want. While this bottle of Juicy is two and half years old it was still an enjoyable beer. I usually do not care much for hoppy wild beers, but Hill Farmstead made this a beer that is very enjoyable. The white wine character is so big in this beer and it pairs quite well with the flavors of the hops. This beer has several elements about it that remind me quite a bit of an authentic Belgian lambic, but Juicy definitely has an American spin to it."
1987,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.36,"Canned 20 Nov. Thanks, Rick.  A clear copper with a dense off-white head with good retention and lacing this looks great. The nose is boozy, bitter, pungent and unabashedly over the top. Sweet? Yes. Pine? Yes. Candied grapefruit? Sweet pickled watermelon rind? Orange? Honey? Are you done asking questions or do I have to hold you upside down and smack you? Yes, maybe, yes and yes. Sweet pineapple and melon are present along with some lychee. The palate opens sweet, boozy and brash with pine and grapefruit bitterness with a lot of sweetness, candied orange, sweetened orange peel, orange marmalade, a little honey and a simple malt sweetness. Honey and mild caramel are present. Sweet, bitter and boozy on the finish. As the carbonation dies down, this takes on a pine like syrupy feel. Tasty, enjoyable, but not the best triple IPA out there. I definitely enjoyed this more than my friend John did."
1988,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.19,Review 1544
1989,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.99,"Super strong fruit aromas. Really nice punch of bitterness that quickly disappears into the sweetness of mango, pineapple, and guava. It is a pretty thick mouthfeel that coats your mouth. Just a fantastic beer. Actually preferred it to max headroom."
1990,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.9,"Old checkin. Had b1 alongside several derivations and TG stouts and it stole the show. Huge bourbon aroma, thick mouthfeel, complex chocolate and stout flavors, along with malty caramel and raisin sweetness. Had b2 a year later and it was great, maybe less bourbon forward than b1."
1991,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,3.44,Canned 3 weeks ago. L -- Golden straw body with near total clarity and two fingers of solid white head produced with moderate pour. Good retention and some lacing
1992,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.35,"Pour like most cloudier ipas but it isn’t murky at all, which is nice. Has a lingering opaque head, no lacing but that could be the pour since this beer usually has some nice lacing. Smell is fruit, mainly citrus lemon and orange to me. Taste follows same, sweeter citrus tangerine, Clementine, sweeter orange (cara cara, if you haven’t tried one do it you’ll thank me.) It finishes with a grapefruit bite. What separates this beer from other hazy beers is that it is not thick and cloying or heavy at all. It finishes pretty dry too and has a soft bitterness that is very pleasant and goes well with it. Glad I get to drink this guy once a year, always an enjoyable experience."
1993,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.49,"Poured into a snifter. A motor oil viscous opaque dark brown color with a small tan head that stuck around for a while. The taste and aroma were as billed with a big coffee presence, maple, chocolate, and faint bourbon. I didn't get much coconut as it seemed to blend with the maple. Thick but not cloying and not boozy. A real treat."
1994,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.53,"Purchased from a private collector for $17. This is 2016 vintage. Comes in a ridiculously huge 19.2 oz can. Pours out deep dark brown, gorgeous color. The head rises up a full 2 inches, but subsides to a quarter of an inch after about 30 seconds. The remainder stays for quite a while, a dark tan. Smell is a nice blend of burned caramel, toffee, chocolate, nut, and bourbon. The taste is rather incredible. Notes of raisin and cherry are present. As well as the flavors apparent in the smell. The bourbon presence is huge and rather dominates this brew. There is also quite a bit of bitterness in the wash on its way down my throat. Mouthfeel is lively and medium-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation present. Overall I'm quite pleased with this. It's a very sticky beer, but not overly sweet. Perfect for a nice night of music making."
1995,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.4,"Rating for 2012 Vintage. Booziness was totally gone and it was smooth, chocolatey raisany goodness. A little sweet, but overall a very enjoyable smooth as F beer I would drink again in a heartbeat."
1996,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.23,"330 ml bottled, blue cap stamped best by 12.07.21, so about a year and a half old. brought back from Belgium about a year ago and cellared since pours a dark brown, with big foamy khaki colored head. pretty good head retention, eventually fades down to a thin covering, but that stays to the bottom of the glass. aroma is earthy, leathery, some dark rum, burnt sugar, and tobacco. taste has similar flavors, but very dry. medium bodied, carbonation is fairly high when I first start drinking, but it mellows out.  now I swirl the yeast from the bottom of the bottle and pour in. the aroma is a bit more estery and herbal. and the taste is a bit more bold and a touch spicy."
1997,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.32,"Canned 1 month ago. Pours medium-hazy orange with two fingers of white head. The nose is orange, melon, bread, and skunky weed. The taste is orange, melon, lemon, passionfruit, onion/chive, crackery malt, and medium bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium for the style. Opens juicy and finishes dry. Overall, very good. I like this more than Heady."
1998,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,5.0,"Thought I’d never score one…much less three…thanks Michele! Poured cold to a champagne coup…closest to a chalice I have. Nose is light floral, with a strong funky bready yeast. Thin effervescent head that maintains throughout. Color is a dark amber, with a few floaters. Taste is a solid crackery malt, with a constant hit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, with an earthy heaviness, and a ton of carbonation. As it warms, there is a stone fruit vibe that really overtakes the tongue. Alcohol doesn’t bite, but brings on some warming fairly quickly. I’d say it’s a great representation of the style, but hell, isn’t this that misleading? This is OG for the style, from which others should compare. I should let the next half of the title warm, as that seems to really bring out more complexity. The flavor lingering is really satisfying. The wife asked if it was worth $50 a bottle? Is any beer “worth” $50 a bottle. Yes. Plus it’s a story of history, with a present day support of a simpler lifestyle and dedication to higher purpose."
1999,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,2.71,"Beer looks okay, but it tastes kind of like old garbage hops that someone forgot about and tried to use. I was excited to try this, but it was a huge let down."
2000,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.35,"The last bottle from a beautiful trade with That_Bearded_Guy this summer, which I was saving to pop on our twentieth wedding anniversary. Split with my marvelous wife! The 750ML bottle has one of those handy tags that rips a hole in the wax big enough to get a bottle opener in, which my oft-punctured fingers appreciate. Silver wax sprays off & we’re into a big, black beer with minimal visible carbonation. The nose is Willy Wonka bar, coffee, & light, warm malts. Nice.  Sump – Barrel Aged Coffee Stout is an odd breed of coffee stout. The coffee shows as roast in the nose & only faintly in the taste, which leans into herbs & dark fruit. Slotting in next is plenty of cocoa, char, lovely shot of whiskey, vanilla creamer, & what tastes like good old Wesley’s Maple Syrup. The Finnish is all NIN bass, dark, driving, tasty. Old school big stout thick (not pastry chef thick), which raises the drinkability level.  This is a beer that is in no way, no form, no how worth the price of admission. It’s Sump plus a bit of char & whiskey. Still: Sump = Excellent, & the BA version continues that trend of excellence. Happy to have it in my mouth."
2001,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.75,"Did this and the 2020 version back to back, because quarantine. Dark clear brown, no head. Smells strongly of booze, wood, toffee, raisin, brown sugar, barley, vanilla, coconut, and caramel, cognac gives a sweeter complexion. Taste is rich, cognac booze, wood, with rich toffee/caramel, molasses, and everything from the smell, especially dark fruits and a hint of candied cherry lingering. Much sweeter than the 2020. Feel is velvet smooth, very warm, rich, and boozy. The wife loved it"
2002,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.75,"Had no idea what I was getting with this one. Loved the can, seen it was a pale ale and grabbed a six pack. Really love the comic book style artwork on the can. "
2003,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.74,"Liquid dessert!! Awesome notes of coffee .. cinnamon adds a creamy feel, Chilies come forward as it warms . Very balanced , i appreciate how this doesn’t go over the top sweet— it has the right amount of fudgey notes, followed by a bitter bite while"
2004,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.17,"Enjoyed much more than I expected to. I'm one of those rare people who's not in love with the standard Oude Geuze, but found this to be much more approachable. That being said, I'd take the Golden Blend over this in a heartbeat."
2005,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,5.0,2019 Bottle poured into Brandy Snifter L: Dark and beautiful as a porter should be. Great tan head with good lacing throughout the entire (short) life of the beer.
2006,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.37,"2018 bottling. Poured from fridge temp on 7.13.2020  Pours dark, minimal head. Nose was well blended ancho, mild cinnamon, chocolate, and bourbon barrel. Taste was well blended between the ancho, cinnamon, and got more tiquilla than bourbon on the taste. Slightly thin for style but made it easy to drink. Overall solid Mexican stout from bottle logic"
2007,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.5,"The beer pours a golden yellow with minimal head.  The nose is like a funky apricot pureed.  The taste is a very sour apricot and vinegar blast with a heavy touch of wet hay funk.  As the beer warms, it becomes...not as good. Stronger on the fruit, but stronger on some of its flaws, too.  The beer finishes very dry with a lingering apricot note remaining on the palate.  Overall, another beer good beer from Side Project. Given what I traded for it, though, I think there are similar sours that can be attained for less than the asking value on this beer. Glad to have tried it, though in no hurry to repeat it."
2008,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.33,"Pours a murky yellow color. Tons of citrus hops and tropical fruits, medium body and no bitterness at all. Very easy to drink. Overall a very good pale ale; not as hoppy as their DDH IPA’s but very good."
2009,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.5,"Black color with dark brown head. Aroma has slightly acidic coffee, even a bit green with some bourbon in the background. Taste is sweet at first, fudgy, continues with sweetened coffee and bourbon, a hint of green coffee bitterness on the finish. Full bodied, medium carbonation. Really nice variation of the base beer, adds a nice flavor complexity."
2010,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.8,"Pours motor-oil black with minimal head. Nose is seriously off, like a cross between an ashtray and burnt sesame candy. Booze is there, too, but largely overpowered. Taste is extremely muddled. Peppery spice, smokiness, minimal barrel presence, with a lot less sweetness than expected from the rum/apple brandy combo. Flavors blend much more pleasantly in the taste than the smell, the mouthfeel is pleasantly thick, but overall this was a real letdown."
2011,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.1,"Blend 40 Season 17/18. Bottled on March 22, 2018.  Look: The beer pours pinkish / light red from the bottle. In the glass it’s translucent cranberry juice / raspberry tea color. An ever so slight haze to it. Lots of carbonation. Light pink head disappears with no lacing. Smell: The fruit is sweet, tart and acidic. Sweet and sugary cherries and raspberries and tart, fresh berries. Then the funk. Plastic-y and band aid notes are most prominent. There’s a faint barnyard manure note. Some bitter and herbal earthiness. The fruit and funk come together as a little cinnamon spice. Really nice nose. Complex. Taste: Tart, acidic and dry. Sometimes the fruit jam sweetness comes through on these beers, but not here. The acidity is manageable and pleasant. Barely hits the jowels and never really goes full lemon juice / vinegar like some sour beers do. There’s a very slight bitterness but sour and faint sweetness are the main flavors here. What I’ll call a musty note that pops fresh and seems to subside as the beer warms. I find it difficult to exactly describe this flavor in lambic. It leans toward the plastic-y note mentioned earlier, but it doesn’t quite go that far. It’s more musty and earthy. I wish I could find a single word to describe the flavor, but I can’t really find anything yet. Feel: Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Very dry. Overall: An enjoyable lambic that showcases the fruit while offering a medium level of funk. A solid A, 4 out of 5 in my book"
2012,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.9,"Pours a gorgeous honey gold with a beautiful white head that retains well and leaves ample lacing. The aroma is delicate and enticing. Light tartness, lemon grass and rind, honeysuckle, wheat, funky brett, honey, and much more! Super complex! The flavor follows the nose, with a nice light lemony tartness to open, followed by wheat, honeysuckle, and honey. It finishes with delightful brett funk. There are many layers of complexity, and it is super delicate! The mouthfeel is just straight up perfect! Divinely soft, with pillow like carbonation, and a delicate dry finish! Essentially perfection of the wine barrel aged saison style! It's hard to imagine it being better done!"
2013,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.77,"500ml bottle, dated 01.06.2021, poured into a stemless wine glass.  The beer pours a hazy and turbid orange color, amber and straw hues with a foamy finger of white head, good retention and lots of soapy lacing. The aroma is lovely, bright tropical fruits leap from the glass, tangy orange, grapefruit and pineapple with an excellent burst of earthiness, pine, hop spice, raw and green hop leaf, grassiness, light floral bouquet but this is super dank. The flavors are great, super dank, piney, resinous and sticky with lots of green hop leaf, grassy, floral, prominent hop spice leads to bitter grapefruit peel, tangy orange juice, pineapple with some sweet yeast and pale cereal grains. The mouthfeel is good, coating, lively medium body that finishes with a very dry bite. Verdict: A superb IPA from Toppling Goliath. Really reminiscent of the very early batches of King Sue, just bone dry and super bitter yet offering the bright tropical flavors and the typical juiciness of the New England style. Just excellent."
2014,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.28,"Dive Bar, Worcester, MA. A- Draft into a goblet with a hazy golden yellow body and a inch creamy head. Good retention and tons of lacing in sheets. S- Big hop quota in the Trillium way. Fresh citrus and stone fruits stick out with tropical, herbal and floral. Ripe mango, apricot, peach, grapefruit, zesty oranges, creamsicle and pineapple. T- Very much more zesty and citrus forward than expected compared to the other Trillium DDH I have tried. Ruby red grapefruit, zesty fresh oranges and tangerines saturate the palate leading into hints of pineapple, apricot, mango, clementine, lime zest and melon. A bit of sweetness and a strong bitterness. Insane amount of grapefruit juice. MF- Medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Somewhat creamy and frothy with a sharp bitter finish. A ton of grapefruit and citrus hops with fair representation of tropical, floral and dank flavors. Delicious grapefruit juice."
2015,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.5,"Another really nice offering from Tree House. Compared with its relatives, I enjoyed this more than Alter Ego, but less than Aaalterrr Ego (sorry if I missed a few letters in there) or Alter Ego w/ Peach. A nice balanced NEDIPA that's got a good amount of hop bite and plenty of juicy character to balance it out. It's easy to get blasé about Tree House's IPA-style beers because they're so darn good - this really is an excellent beer, but there are also 10 or 12 TH beers in the same style that I prefer."
2016,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,5.0,"2016 vintage. Had on draft at Lost Abbey 10th Anniversary party, May 21, 2016. Writing review on notes I took that day."
2017,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.8,2017-08-22
2018,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.73,"Pours rich gold color, opaque with a silky, soapy biscuit two finger head. The aroma has dense earthy orange notes with a touch of juicier tropical notes. The flavor is also dense with lightly sweet orange and pineapple notes. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick with a light to moderate bitterness in the finish. No real alcohol burn i can discern. This a fantastic NEIPA, richly flavored but wisely less sweet so it comes across more subtle. Has some substance to it, so feels malty. Well done."
2019,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.66,"Like a liquid mounds bar. The aromas are subtle, but definitely there from the glass. The magic really happens on the palette. The chocolate and coconut come through perfectly and are backed up by the smooth base beer. Barrel comes though, but only just enough to complement the beer and bring everything together."
2020,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,3.9,"A: Medium haziness of orange for coloring with a white soapy foam composition of one inch. Sticky strands of lacing. Strong carbonation factor. S: Really sweet sugary peaches, watermelon and guava. A bit of strawberry-lemonade. Good strength. Has a bit of juicy Gatorade flair.  T: Dry flowery hopping, citrus, and orange grind with a bready malting.  M: Bready malty consistency for mouthful.  O: Overall loved the nose, fruity and berry like, fresh, wet and Gatorade like. The flavor was a bit less impressing, less complexed and basic."
2021,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.82,"Poured into a snifter. Like most other big Prairie stouts, a black pour with a minimal tan head which fades to a ring. There is a pretty strong aroma- the Ancho chiles jump out at me, but chocolate and whiskey are there in the background. The taste is complex: there is a hint of coffee present, but whiskey and chocolate are most prominent, with caramel malt, vanilla, oak notes, and a touch of cinnamon following. The whiskey is extremely well-melded with the rest of the beer, and is present mid-palate through the finish. The chiles are somewhat muted, compared to the standard Bomb!, but provide a nice warming heat at the finish. The beer is full bodied, incredibly smooth the entire way through, and a touch boozy on the finish. Pretty incredible. Huge fan of Prairie's stouts, but this one surpassed my expectations and blew me away."
2022,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.2,"Nice looking stout. Smell is of bourbon, sweetness, and coconut. Taste follows the nose, nice rich flavor with bourbon and coconut dominating the palate. Some roastiness. Coats the tounge nice but slightly thin and is a little over carbed. Overall good coconut stout. The coconut could be stronger"
2023,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.75,"Can. Little head. Dark brown/black color. Massive oak and bourbon. Is this bourbon or beer? I can’t tell. Vanilla, toffee, caramel. This is barley wine vs stout vs bourbon. Warming, smooth, boozey all in one. I don’t know how it’s possible. Dark dried fruits, molasses, and wet oak. Just wow. This is unlike any other deal with a devil."
2024,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,3.9,First time I had this it changed my perspective of fruited American sours. Explosive peach juice and perfect lactic balance. THe 2017 has been overtaken by brett.
2025,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.91,"Back when OH used to brew smaller batches, this was easily the best beer in the world. Today, less so, but still packs a powerful punch. Absurdly drinkable for an 8.5% DIPA. Candy crush pineapple dreams. RIP OH before they scaled up."
2026,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.5,Twice tried and twice enjoyed! One of the best Barleywines made in my opinion and worthy of the cult status and the high scores. Need not be aged but will stand up for at least a few years.
2027,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.38,"Growler into pint glass. Pours a dark dark brown with a minimal darak tan head. Initial impression is expresso, chocolate, booze, vanilla, maybe a touch of molasses, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth; carbonation is minimal. Finish is oily-smooth and yet conveys a warning note of the substantial ABV. "
2028,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.71,"Pours an opaque orange with two fingers of frothy, dense white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is a blast of tangerine, papaya, lemon and mandarin oranges. Grassy hops and a light bready yeast at the back rounds out the aroma. Flavor profile is tangerine, papaya, mango, lemon, mandarin oranges, and bready malts create a soothing hypnotic experience. Balance is sublime, never coming off overly sweet or bitter. Mouth feel has a consistent siltiness to it with a medium-thick consistency that adds power to each sip. Overall, a delectable brew with big tropical fruit notes, and a well-refined balance.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz can."
2029,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.52,"2014 vintage Appearance: Very dark brown with medium-sized dark beige head, which dissipated fairly quickly. Noticeable legs on this one. A nice looking BT variant. the head stuck around which is notable for a beer 18.9%. Smell: Rum and brown sugar aromas are the prominent aromas followed by some raisin aromas. I also pick up faint alcohol aromas which is very nice in light of the high ABV. Taste: The rum and brown sugar notes from the nose carry over to the taste, along with the raisin notes. I also pick up some moderate vanilla and coffee/roast malts notes. This particular variant is sweet like other Black Tuesday (BT) variants I've had but it dries out quicker than the regular Bourbon bal-aged variant. The beer dries out nicely with a touch of rum sweetness in the finish. I sat on this for 6 years but how little alcohol presence this beer has for it's listed 18.9% is amazing.  Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a modest level of carbonation appropriate for the style. Very restrained alcohol presence for the listed ABV. Overall: A very nice BT variant, The complex tasty palate of regular BT with Rum bal-aging rather than Bourbon bal-aging. The subdued alcohol presence is deceptive to the point of being dangerous if someone doesn't respect the 18.9% ABV. One can only hope this is rebrewed."
2030,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,3.63,"Pours black with a brown head (maybe hints of pink in the head or could be my imagination). Smells like any other stout with the malty/chocolate aroma. Taste is a little chocolate and vanilla a little lingering strawberry. Kind of just a novelty beer, made by great stout brewers."
2031,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.5,What has become a standard to which others are compared for American Wild Ale. Too bad it's so limited as it should be enjoyed by all. A world class beer.
2032,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.63,"Deep gold hazy peach juice color with clarity under rocky three fingers of white foam that receded slowly rendering a mousse-like dome; excellent cap retention to bottom of glass, heavy ring, heavy lacing. Nose is pineapple and orange. Taste follows nose with bitter orange rind, sweet tangerine/malt base. Smooth feel; medium full body; somewhat juicy; moderate minus carbonation; no tongue fatigue, no astringency, no warmth from 7.5% abv. Overall, the beer smells and tastes more tropical fruit juicy than Very Green; I’m enjoying this beer a little bit more, but not by much, and on a different day I could have swung dank. World Class."
2033,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.35,"Batch 5, bottled January, 2019, drank over two nights in September, 2019 first from a Hill Farmstead stemmed wineglass, then from a Tree House Teku. A beautiful looking beer that hit all the right notes from the look, feel and smell departments, same as others have described. The taste, again, hitting on those same descriptions, was good, but for me it ended up being just too acidic; I even had to ditch the last couple ounces as my stomach had had enough. Usually I'm ok with excessively wild wilds, etc. but the acidity for this version of BT (only one I've tried), was off the charts for me - it didn't actually taste ""overly"" acidic; the taste was really pretty good, it was more the effect that the acidic component had on my stomach. I have read this in a couple other reviews so not sure if this is typical of all BTs, or if it was more isolated to this batch. Or maybe some more time in the bottle would have helped? Either way, it was a bit of a disappointment, especially for a beer that I had waited so long to try and so eagerly anticipated."
2034,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.83,"Parabola pours black, with a small, tan head. Aroma is big, huge, whiskey notes, oak, and black licorice. Flavor is sweet, and a little bitter, aggressive, whiskey and oak flavors, warm, hints of smoke and black licorice, a tad of tobacco to finish. Good body and feel. Overall, an increasable, perfectly put together stout."
2035,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,3.94,"Slightly hazy unpolished gold with a fizzy white blanket settling to a thin spotty film. Having this side by side with Smooth, this is more sour, sharp and sweet, and also slightly firmer of body with a crisp fizz. The oak is almost vinegary in the swallow, and oh yeah, it's acetic. Funk and oak are less present here, but there's still a complexity of oak. However, it's less wine-like and more neutral. There are hints of yellow apple, mango and biscuit, but it's just way too acidic."
2036,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,3.25,"Pours dark brown, almost black in color with a big, spongy beige head, vanishing fast. Smells of all the advertized adjuncts, foremost highlighting the beer‘s coffee, which gets even more pronounced by the sweet maple syrup, inheriting an additional blueberry quality.  Has a slightly creamy, medium body with just enough finely integrated carbonation to add a refreshing note to the beer. Tastes of toasty, earthy coffee beans, entangled into melting toffee and balancing, sweet maple syrup. Turns even sweeter then, with a smoky hint of sugar glazed bacon, finding a well working antagonist in the multi facetted coffee. Finishes with a coca-cola sweetness, which overpowers everything else, even the coffee, introducing an additional note of rock sugar and no creaminess prevailing. No real complexity to be found in this, nor does the taste itself make up for the higher abv. This is mediocre at best."
2037,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.12,"Thanks to a local for swapping fluids with me & knocking a long, long time want off my list. 375ML classic Jackie O’s bottle while watching Merle die & celebrating another Twins win.  Inky black with no rise even given a hard pour. The nose is barrel & a sweetness that leans hard into molasses & chocolate. The unholy trinity.  Appervation could be presented as a Black Tuesday variation & I wouldn’t bat an eye. The mouthfeel is decadent AF, as the kids say, thicker than grandma’s fudge batter & almost as appealing. Bourbon booms out of the glass, along with most of the malts harvested in 2017. Sweet, dripping sweet, oak, maple, fudge, black silk, black licorice. No booziness present except when I stood up to go relieve myself. Bed is two flights of stairs away.  Not quite sure what the hype was about. Jackie O’s makes better BA stouts, but I understand that having Derivation in, or rumored to be in, its DNA brings out the hype beast. Still an excellent BA stout."
2038,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.5,"16oz can. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a good-sized, off0white head of foam. It left sticky rings of lace on the glass. It smelled of pine, orange juice, mango and pineapple. Big juicy taste with tons of tropical fruit, sweet caramel and a piney bitter punch."
2039,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,2.93,"Batch 2, pours brown into the glass, not overly thick, small lighter brown head on the top, 1/5"". Aroma and appearance both look and smell like cognac. Massive amount of fusel like alcohol waft from the glass. Wow, this is just like smelling rubbing alcohol. Taste, man the alcohol is the dominant thing going on. A little bit of french oak like notes from the cognac barrel up the senses and probably get the alcohol burn pairing with a drier astringency, thereby totally dominating the mouth in a non consensual way. It just burns the entire way through. Some toffee aspect to it, but it still tastes like burning. At this point, I just have to reconcile the harsh fact that I don't like anything aged in a cognac barrel, Eclipse cognac masterpiece or whatever was limited for the same reasons. Or maybe cognac barrel aging just needs to be for far less time to contour itself to my palate limitations. A lot of raisin bitterness too, despite a very mild set of carbonation and decent amount of sweetness (coming from where, I don't know) to it.  I like so much Anchorage stuff, but this is my least favorite of anything they make, no doubt because of the heavy amount of Cognac influence."
2040,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.6,"a 2010 vintage generously shared with me after quite literally years of anticipating this bottle together. its incredible stuff, worth the wait, and as good as anything i have had from these guys really, every bit as good as the lou kriek or the fou. deep dusty brick red in color, dense with fruit here, not as electric and bright looking as a lot of raspberry beers, and with a fizzy lazy head, not super robust there. the nose is mind melting for me, pure raspberry and insanely mature lambic funk and tartness, turbid wheaty aged hop base, tons of oak and brett, a well developed wild acidity as well, this is rather piquant, and then of course all the berry, as natural as it gets and like stuffing an entire handful of them in my face, as intense as can be. i smell it for awhile before i taste it, so complex and mouthwatering and inviting. great sourness up front in the flavor highlights the fruit right from the start, with the sturdy wood and mature wildness right there with it, tart and red winey towards the finish, a little sweet from the fruit, still malty in a lambic sense, and really brightly acidic and interesting. the complexity of the yeast elements here is as good as it gets, and why cantillon is so well regarded as far as i am concerned. the raspberries are perfect with it, and really bold in this beer. the maturity is unrivaled and the flavor is just incredible. beautiful lambic, famous for a reason, and probably even more striking to me now in terms of quality because there are so many lackluster fruited sours out there in the world. this is the cream!"
2041,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.33,**
2042,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.34,"2016. From bottle into chalice. Very little foam on pour. Brown/amber in color. More of an appearance of a barleywine rather than a stout. Barrel character here is huge. Loads of bourbon and oak. Chocolate was present on the nose and in the taste, along with some mild vanilla as the beer warmed. But make now mistake, this is hot and this is barrel boozy. If you don't like the heat, you might want to sit on this for a few years."
2043,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.19,"I finally had a chance to try this East Coast IPA and compare it to the West Coast Pliny The Elder, as it is now being sold in the San Francisco Bay Area. Look: Pours a cloudy golden color. Doesn't quite have the had that Pliny does, but a tasty looking beer. Smell: Fresh hops, pine, and maybe light hint of grapefruit. Taste: Hoppy. Maybe a little too hoppy for my personal taste, though not nearly as strong as others I've had. Feel: A very easy drinking beer, with a light carbonation.  Overall: Overall, I'd call this an above average IPA, but perhaps a bit hoppy for my personal liking. I prefer Pliny, though my personal favorite IPA is Dogfish Head."
2044,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.4,"Overall pretty epic, it takes everything I expected West Ashley to be, but much more mellow and deep in flavors. After this and Fou I am a believer in apricot sours!"
2045,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.68,"2013 vintage drank in a snifter 4/12/2016 L-rich and dark, dark brown with a minimal head and thick lacing S-scotch, caramel, and a little sweet booze. The Belgian candy sugar is noticeable here for sure. T-this is where it becomes exceptional. super complex. this mainly is the rating at about room temperature because it kept getting so much better as it warmed that i saved most of it after about sitting 45 minutes. Smooth apple brandy mixed with rich caramel, bourbon, oak, some fig and other dark fruits as well. F-smooth, no heat, minimal booze. goes down really nice. the richness doesn't make it super drinkable but i wouldn't want that in this type either. really enjoyable O-a highly unique and complex beer that is done about as well as I could imagine. Really exceptional. The apple brandy barrel does overpower the bourbon barrel but who doesn't love apple brandy?! Not as much smoke as expected but that's nitpicking. This is exactly what I want in a barrel aged strong ale."
2046,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.6,I had been wanting to try this one for a long time and finally got to during FoFA weekend as on on-site offering at the brewery. Tremendous. Not too sweet - perfectly balanced.
2047,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.46,"12-4-18 - I’ve had this one many times before, but never on my bride’s 55th birthday. 5/1/18 bottle date in the RRBC caged and corked bottle. Yes, I poured slowly into my RRBC tulip glass and left just a bit in the bottle."
2048,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.67,Very dark appearance with nice light brown head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is a very rich slightly sweet chocolate. Taste is a very smooth slightly sweet and rich chocolate.
2049,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.37,"Brewed on 12/7/18, picked up at TreeHouse on 12/8. Tasted on 12/11 Cold straight from the fridge in a TreeHouse Teku glass it looks good not an overly frothy head once it settles down, has a good rich look, no light gets through, not as flavorful as other TreeHouse stouts I've tasted and at 7.9% alcohol you can begin to smell the alcohol esters like you would an Imperial Stout even though they call this one a Milk Stout."
2050,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.8,"This one is unique and a special experience. I took my time and with each sip got lost in a medley of vanilla, roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel, charred wood, and bourbon. My only regret was that I was tasting this one solo, and not sharing the experience with a friend. Will have to save a few bottles and share post covid....or maybe not ;-)"
2051,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.55,"Review #1500!!! A massive thanks goes out to cmrillo for bringing this one out during his own 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Can’t believe I FINALLY got to try this one!!! 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, dark chocolate, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, sweet alcohol, and milk chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. This was another one that I was shocked to see come out at the birthday party. This was sampled directly after Stormaktsporter. There was a pretty good difference in this one from the base brew. There was a lot more presence of the vanilla with an addition of various chocolate aspects. The cigar aspect I picked up on in the base brew had disappeared, but what replaced it in both the flavor and aroma was just plain excellent. So glad I got the chance to finally try this one and would love to do so over and over again."
2052,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.81,"MAPLE! Bourbon, maple, chocolate and vanilla goodness. For how high the ABV is, it did not taste boozy in the slightest. It certainly packs a punch but its pretty sneaky about it. Big fan of BL (when I can get it) and this did not disappoint at all!"
2053,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,3.88,"Looks and smells nice, but I find the taste, eh, lacking something. Seems like the odd carbonation/mouthfeel is hiding the hop character this beer wants to have. Can dated 3/22 - maybe it was much better fresh...or maybe TreeHouse is overrated"
2054,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.49,"Thanks to JLindros for sharing. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice darker brown with a thin head that fades to leave a very thin halo.  S - Aromas of juicy bourbon, chocolate fudge, light barrel, almost nutty, sweet candied nuts. Interesting base beer. Smells like a stout was blended with a barley wine.  T - Taste is much more barleywine like. Great caramel notes and light toffee. Nice sweeter malts lead way to great chocolate. Like a chocolate covered caramel. Candied walnuts, fudgy brownie, nice almost candied fig thing going on too. Starts off barleywine and ends a stout.  M - Mouthfeel is lightly bodied, could be thicker. O - Overall this beer was rather tasty, just not really barleywine like. Delicious beer though! Serving type: bottle"
2055,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.53,"Tastes and smells like biting into a citrus fruit on a freshly cut lawn beside a copse of pine trees. Great mouthfeel, very drinkable. Enough bitterness to balance out the juiciness nicely. A stalwart in Trillium’s awesome lineup."
2056,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,Look: Pours an opaque but bright orange with good head retention and lacing.
2057,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.23,"2017 vintage. Pours jet black, small-medium head. Aroma is full of roast. Taste is roast and chocolate, with a bit of barrel hanging on. The beer is still smooth, but if you have any left from '17, drink them now. They won't age any better, in my opinion."
2058,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.35,"750 ml bottle into a tulip snifter. Best by 2/19/18, had 11/21/18. Shame on me for missing by that much. Pours a purplish amber, cloudy, with a one inch foamy head and some foamy lacing. Aromas of cherries, raspberries, some cranberries, malt, some vanilla. The flavor is similar- cherries, raspberries, malt, some cranberries, light vanilla. Not picking up the oak or caramel. Lightly tart and sour, fairly sweet. Smooth, a solid medium body, well carbonated. It’s all about the fruit and it’s very well executed. The tartness of the cranberries is a nice balance to the sweetness of the cherries and raspberries. Undoubtedly, missing the best by date by 9 months has had some effect here. Very enjoyable and well worth a purchase."
2059,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,5.0,"Drank season 17/18 blend no. 49. This is by far one of the best lambics on the market. Well balanced, flavorful beer. Our bottle had some carbonation and and great complexity."
2060,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.71,"Enjoyed on draft at Smoke and Barrell bbq joint. Juicy, creamy, smooth...enter any adjective here and it applies! Throughly enjoyed this even though smoky bbq might not be the best pairing!"
2061,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,"This is the most ridiculously well-tasting beverage I've tasted in my entire life. Lots of massive chocolate, non-synthetic marsmallow, vanilla, bourbon- thick body. Insane! Both 2018 and 2015."
2062,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.75,"2018 version poured from the bottle into a snifter. Drank this beer on 4/19/2021 in remembrance of dad's birthday. This beer is wonderfully creamy, smooth and filled with chocolate. Just a touch of bourbon sweetness."
2063,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.3,"Poured into a snifter. Viscous and opaque on the pour. Midnight in the glass. Minimal head with wisps of tan foam. Whiskey, vanilla, oak, cocoa, and roasted coffee on the nose. Not boozy-smelling. Tasted like rich fudge dipped in bourbon. The flavors played very well together. The whiskey predominated, and there was a tinge of sour on the finish, but overall it was balanced. Full-bodied but not overly sweet. Better than the non BA version."
2064,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.47,"Beer #1600 on BA is another beauty. Brew #8 from the Hop Culture Juicy Brews box, a 16oz can poured into a glass coffee mug. A: Moderately thick black pour; certainly dense and opaque but not the thickest stout ever. Capped by a creamy mocha head. S: Delicious, decadent, rich coffee and maple syrup character. Chocolatey notes as well. The coffee isn't acrid or bitter, just smooth and rich and plays well with the maple syrup sweetness. T: Yeah, so easy to drink - this is literally my wheelhouse. Just enough sugary maple syrup to be rich and decadent without being cloying; roasted malt profile bolsters up that sweetness, and the fresh coffee shines through with a breakfast-y feel to it. MF: Again, not the biggest stout I've seen or tried but big enough, and the body stands up to the adjuncts. O: Just delicious and darn near perfect for a maple syrup coffee stout."
2065,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.09,"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed tulip. Pours black with a decent brown head that fizzes away quickly. Mostly rum on the nose. Faint hints of chocolate. Even as it warms the taste is mostly rum, tobacco, leather. Some chocolate and very slight vanilla sweetness at the end. A subtle warmth from the chilies and a little harshness from the alcohol, which is steep. Light to medium body. Would like a bit more balance as the barrel overpowers a tad. Great if rum is your jam."
2066,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.6,"This 2021 release tastes a bit young when compared with prior years. Some 'heat' from the alcohol is evident in the first sips, and the overall taste is not as rich as I remember in prior years. Maybe this one needs some aging to reach its potential., but it's a very good beer now."
2067,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,5.0,"On premise pour while picking up bottle from 2020 oznr lottery. Thick, spicy, sweet. Couldn’t be happier about this. King of Mexican chocolate beers"
2068,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.48,"Sweet and tart, prominent apricot and hint of farmhouse funky nose on this one! Taste follows with a well-balanced, apricot fruity, and hint of funky swallow. This has a fantastic mouthfeel and is just so well done! This is great!"
2069,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.75,"2018 bottle Look: Pitch black and thick like motor oil. Half a finger of thick head the color of chocolate milk. Smell: Very strong chocolate, raspberry, caramel, and vanilla. Taste: Chocolate, bourbon, caramel, cinnamon, and alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, with very mild carbonation. Overall: A monster of a dessert beer, fully deserving of its reputation but challenging to the inexperienced."
2070,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.27,"2020 release. Bottled a couple weeks ago.  A: Pours black with a razor thin ring of head. Looks kinda flat. No lacing. S: Toasted coconut, vanilla bean, maple and brown sugar sweetness, cocoa, butterscotch, and a bit of coffee, bourbon, and roast, and dust.  T: A blast of coconut, which dominates the palate. Supported by moderate coffee, light roast, vanilla, maple, butterscotch, and brown sugar. Moderate sweetness.  M: Thick, mouthcoating, sticky full body. Very light carbonation, bordering on flat, which makes it sort of syrupy. Alcohol very well hidden.  O: Solid, tasty BA adjunct stout. Barrel treatment is light. Needs more carb."
2071,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.31,Tasted this in a flight for black Friday 2020 with a three year virtical. 
2072,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.52,On tap at brewery. 
2073,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.41,"12oz bottle of Batch #3, courtesy of BeerloserLI, that was bottled on November 14, 2016, that I'd stashed and afterwards forgotten about. Kinda wish I'd remembered it earlier. Poured into the glass, this was was an opaque, super-dark brown, virtually black. About an inch of tan foam was present, although it mostly vanished quickly. Not surprising when you consider the abv. Boozy nose, but not overly bourbony, if that's a word. What boozeiness there is actually reminds me more of rum. There's a nutty aroma, with a whiff of milk chocolate as well. The coffee seems to have died out at this point. Dark malts and booze and milk chocolatey sweetness up front, pretty evenly balanced. I'm kinda suprised how much alcohol there still is after 4 yrs. Medium bodied, with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Nice nightcap on this cold mid-November night. While the coffee has faded, it's still a bit of a booze-bomb after 4yrs. Curious how long you'd have to lay this down for it to mellow! Regardless, thanks, Brian, for a shot at this at a time when it wasn't reliably available in my neck of the woods."
2074,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,5.0,"Look: One finger white head, hazy orange body.  Smell : See below. Taste : Barnhouse brett funk, peach, mild malt. Feel : Sour and balanced upfront, dry finish."
2075,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.37,"Pours a reddish brown. Head dissipates. Nose of flowers, followed by strong candied cherry, raspberry. Taste of jammy cherry notes, do get minimal raspberry, cranberry in flavor leading the beer to be dry, oak on the end. Light to medium carb and body. Overall, another excellent flanders red from rodenbach"
2076,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.38,"Canned 8/19/21. Purchased 8/24/21 at Deerfield. L: Pours a deep hazy orange. Short fluffy white head with big bubbles. Decent retention. Pretty lacing. S: Tropical and citrus fruit aromas. Orange, mango, grapefruit, and lemon. All pretty subtle. T: Fruit up front, especially grapefruit, which quickly blends into a smooth combo of tropical/citrus. Finishes dry with a touch of bitterness. F: Soft and smooth mouthfeel.  O: Extremely well done blend of tropical and citrus flavors, topped off with a terrific dry/bitter finish."
2077,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,3.84,"375 mL bottle. Hazy orange without much of a head. Nice nectarine aroma. It smells of very distinct peach/nectarine/stone fruit. The taste is immensely sour up front. Oak. Strong stone fruit. Very juicy. After the sourness dies down, it has a little bit of nectarine sweetness. Standard absurd Side Project sourness. Makes it difficult to drink. Low carbonation. Very flavorful, but overly sour."
2078,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.82,"I had this two days ago on Thanksgiving. The review is from notes. It was aged in 40 year old sherry barrels giving it some sherry flavor. I found it to have a Geuze like tart flavor, maybe too tart for some. However, I thought it was truly delicious and very refreshing as well as complex. If you like Lambics (and Geuze) I think you will agree. Look: hazy golden with a thin white head Aroma: lemon, apple, apricot/peach, sherry Taste: I taste lemon, apple, tart apricot/peach, sherry, and a dry oak finish. Very nice dry tart aftertaste. Body/Overall: light to medium body."
2079,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.82,Covid screwed up Huhaphu last March and I got some perks because of it. Wife and I travelled to Tampa from the Daytona area for a day trip and CC had a small trailer set up with several of their best brews there to taste. I NEVER thought I'd have this but am so glad I was able to try it. Amazingly smooth and apprecibly tastier than regular Imp Stout (which is great). Yay Cigar City
2080,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.75,"Thick pour, nose shows light coconut and vanilla (but no overpowering), taste is not too sweet with noticeable barrel characteristics - well balanced, mouthfeel is smooth and still, a great and generally easy to obtain release from an amazing brewery."
2081,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.17,"Canned on 11/15/17 Opened on 12/6/17 Pours out a rather sexy orange hued gold with yellow highlights. Hazy...practically opaque with a white, bubbly foam matter that fizzles slow. Only the slightest scattering of foam andva minimal but present ring around tge edge of the glasd remains.  The nose is overwhelmed by dank hops....freshly crushed up whole cone hops, very earthy....wet forest on a mid july morning, herbal and spicy, hefty grains of the harvest, lightly sweet fruity notes, grandma's spice rack and a sweet, but light honey bite from the malt. Extraordinary. This Pale Ale certainly gives many ipa's a ""run for the money"" in hop-complexity. A very freshly harvested hop flavor proves to be impressive, green, leafy veggies, mango, starfruit, pineapple juice all seem to be within the earthy and herbal dominated hop affect. Spring water and herbal malty flavor seems rather odd....herbs, veggies and hearty grains make up the pale malt flavor. Tangy wheat malt with seriously sweet and sour fruits and herbs sums it up well. A very low...almost void-of bitterness style hop edge seems just a bit strange. Thr hops seem very fresh, but also mild in the finish, perhaps an effect of tge mosaic strain being the dry hopped choice?  Layers of flavor's from the hops happen in subtle ways, from tropical juice of starfruit and pineapple, to earthy, sour herbs. The layers are also obvious in the mouthfeel, juicy medium body, dry and peppery middle with a long, malty and juicy finish.  Favorite aspect is the seriously fresh tasting hop complexity, with earthy and non-bitter tropucal fruit notes. A very melliw vibe with multiple layers of complexity. Odd and interesting."
2082,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.5,"A: Pours a light orange-yellow with about 2 fingers of white head A: Smells like a nice, ripe, freshly peeled tangerine T: On the first sip, you pick up lots of citrus; grapefruit, tangerine are the first two that come to mind. Very faint bitterness on the end. M: Refreshing, clean, with a nice amount of carb for an IPA O: Very enjoyable IPA; I can see why its highly sought after. Glad I got to try this."
2083,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.18,"12oz canned 9-17-19, opened 10-10-19."
2084,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.91,"2017 bottle stored in cellar since purchase. Poured into a 3F teku. Pours an inky black body with a big brown head that sticks around for a while, leaving rings of lacing.  Aromas are heavenly - cinnamon-bourbon vanilla, dark chocolate. The mouth matches the nose with a perfectly balanced medly of cinnamon and bourbon, vanilla, horchata, a little bit of spice on the finish, leaving a slightly roasty flavor on the palette. Rich mouthfeel. One of the best stouts I've ever tasted. I just opened a bottle of 2019 Barrel Aged Abraxas and this blows it out of the water (although I've heard 2019 BAA is not a great batch)"
2085,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.75,Bottle on-site at de Garde. This one was as advertised and maybe even better. One of the best fruited wild ales I have ever had. Nearly perfect in execution - incredible fruit flavor and just enough sourness. I liked this better than Nectarine Premiere.
2086,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.47,"2018 release. A moderately aggressive pour into a teku begrudgingly produces a finger of cocoa powder-colored head atop a pitch-black, but not super-thick, liquid. Oak, tannins, plum, bitter dark chocolate, bourbon booze, and pepper round out the nose. The front palate is very restrained but quickly blossoms, with warming bourbon spice, barrel wood, vanilla, and fudge. Intense barrel character that I love--strong, with a lot of whiskey character, but without a hot mid-palate. Modestly dry finish that leans back into the vinous notes and adds just a touch of smoke."
2087,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.56,This is my first AB beer and man I'm enjoying it!
2088,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.18,"L — 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals a deep black body that allows barely any light through. Quite surprising given the ABV. Finger of light brown head produced with moderate pour. Good retention and some lacing"
2089,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.65,Poured into a tulip glass via draft Color is banana yellow Smell is dank and pungent pine and tropical fruits Taste follows the nose very nicely..no alcohol burn here at all..very smooth Carbonation is medium  Mouthfeel is creamy Its easy to see why this rates so high..a textbook example of a New England IPA
2090,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.6,"4/22/17 @ MTKATL - Bottle poured into snifter. Thick viscosity, rich dark color. This is full body w/ Coffee on front that blooms on palate at back end. Lovely"
2091,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.31,Poured from a 16 oz can into a Willi Becher pint glass.
2092,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.96,"Pours dark and opaque, with a dark tan head with moderate retention and nice lacing. Aroma is heavy with roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Taste follows, with coffee being the dominant flavor, with just a hint of cocoa. A strong body from the oats and roasted malt make for a delightful experience, with just a hint of alcohol warmth rounding out the silky smooth mouthfeel."
2093,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,2.5,"This beer should come with a satisfaction guarantee! I have had Abyss that was worthy of a 5 and I have had Abyss that was an instant drain pour and Deschutes needs to either get it right or quit making it. The 2009 was infected, the 2014 was infected, I recently had a 2016 which was infected. At the price, I won't take the chance any more."
2094,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.58,"11/2014 - Wow, this is amazing; incredible aromas of peach, dank hops, fruit poppin'! Mildly sweet, hoppy, zesty, fruity too flavors on the palate; so good and balanced."
2095,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,3.81,"12oz can poured into a tulip. Pours almost black; creamy khaki head that fades leaving solid retention and lacing. The aromas are malt forward. Hints of chocolate and cocoa. Some cherries and dark fruits. Mild hints of vanilla. The bourbon is pretty subtle in the aroma department and almost goes unnoticed. The flavors are balanced. More chocolate leading the way. More hints of vanilla coming from the oak. More cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins too. Some molasses. Subtle spiciness. Possibly some hints of rye and black pepper in the mix. The bourbon is subtle but noticeable and blends well with everything. Subtle sweetness. Low bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Subtle alcohol flavors in the finish along with an enjoyable warmth, but it's not hot or boozy at all. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy, velvety, creamy and smooth.  This is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. It's subtle and bold at the same time. I always liked Plead The 5th, but never tried the barrel-aged version so I'm glad to have finally tried it after all of these years. It's simply enjoyable and fun to drink. Not bad at all. I like it."
2096,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.5,"Pours a clear chestnut color, no carbonation. One of the most amazing aromas I have ever had the privledge of enjoying. Tons of burnt sugar, dark fruits, raisins, molasses, dark brown sugar, nutty. I found myself smelling the small snifter well after the liquid was drank. It didn’t taste nearly as good as it smelled, which was fine. A little goes a long way with this beverage. It is delicious, but I would never buy a bottle. But, if a bar is pouring it, I am all in.  12/15/18"
2097,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.67,"2014 Edition, bottle #114.  Black pour at 54 degrees with grey/ruby edges when held up to the light; fizzy grayish tan head with some retention of swirls of micro dot bubbles/cap; solid ring, sudsy lacing; medium thick legs. Chocolate, coconut, molasses, rye nose; bourbon on exhale. Bourbon, molasses, rye, chocolate, oak, vanilla, dark stone fruits - cherries and plums; caramel malt sweetness as liquid warms; molasses finish. Velvety smooth, medium full feel with a dry tongue coating; moderate minus carbonation; face flushing warmth from 13.7%. Overall, very satisfying; no oxidation or off flavors on this 4 1/2 years old stout; the bourbon/barrel notes are somewhat subdued but present; the rye drys the tongue, but not aggressively; nice balance of semi sweet malt and fruit with barrel flavors; tasty long molasses linger; World Class!"
2098,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.51,"2019 edition poured into a tulip glass via draft Color is a milk chocolate brown Smell is light cinnamon, vanilla and bourbon Taste is a more muted cinnamon and chili pepper flavor than i was expecting which was a bit of a disappointment, yet even with the toned down flavors this was still great as everything blended well. Some creamy vanilla was evident and the barrel presence was nice Carbonation was low Mouthfeel was exceptional and the best part as it was thick and creamy and just enough sweetness. I had high expectations for this beer and while it was very good i wanted a bit more spice from it"
2099,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.52,"My long time white whale, we meet at last... As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening, we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions. The progression is beautifully subtle, while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark. Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna, with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body. This has closer to a honey appearance, whereas Anna is a hazier, paler yellow, with a larger, fluffier white head. The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than I was expecting, delivering a delicate experience that is less funky, yet more woody. White grape, riesling wine, and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry, falling off the palate quickly. There's a hint of green olive, and it's only mildly sour, with essentially no funkiness at all. This is possibly the most wine-like experience I've gotten out of a beer. So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare. It even sweetens up over time. Ann is absurdly refined and complex, yet exceedingly simple. It does not have the body of the other wonderful Farmstead beers, and while I love it, I think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is, as well as all the other HF shelfies, which are just so supple, easy to enjoy, and complex in their own right. Bottled 2015, released 2019. Thanks Stanley!"
2100,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.63,"Muted orange haze. Nose is candy peach, pineapple, and whipped cream. Taste is super ripe peach, fruit gummies, melon, and a hint of mango. Ridiculously saturated fruit flavors. Soft but moderately crisp mouthfeel. Super drinkable. Wild!"
2101,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.25,"16oz. can into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. Shared with schen9303.  Muddy but with a nice fluffy head and great lace. Nose is super aromatic. I get pineapple, candied peach, citrus, and cane sugar. Juicy. Beer opens dank tropical fruit hop presence. I get flavors of pineapple, mango, peach, and lychee. Foamy towards the end with cane sugar, more pineapple, and almost a vanilla creaminess at the finish. Really robust. Body is medium with moderate carbonation. Smooth and soft on the palate and goes down prickly and lively. Dry finish. Very drinkable.  This is a fantastic beer and certainly one of the best of the Haze line."
2102,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.71,"Loved this at 2-3 years old but a 5-year old bottle tasted phenomenal. Still well-carbonated and a bit more honey presence than I remember previously. On the whole kind of on the sweeter side but what an amazing bourbon barrel. Loads of flavor and very smooth for nearly 12%, considering the age on it this surpassed expectations on all fronts. Wish I had another cuz the 2015 vintage will keep on truckin for sure."
2103,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.31,"Pours a golden peach with a fluffy fast dissipating head. Aroma is big on mango and pineapple with a piney crackery malt note. Flavor is tropical fruits, slightly bitter hops, and a soft malt backbone. Goes down smoothly with a crisp finish. A well crafted DIPA."
2104,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.46,"Very hazy yellow, little white head."
2105,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.41,"A huge thanks to Nick for this one. You are far too generous.  355ml bottle - no date ('18 or '19 I'm sure) - poured into a balloon stem at 48°F.  Pours a thin, mahogany brown with amber highlights, sitting basically black in the glass. When held to the light, the beer appears clear, deep garnet red, with micro suspended particulate. A finger of very light, foamy tan head forms, and recedes fairly quickly, leaving a nice collar.  Nose: Compared to so many maple beers out there, two things stand out here. One, the maple is strong - balanced, not overpowering, but very forward. Two, the maple is very organic - like a pot with dark maple syrup reducing. Notes of maple fudge, chocolate chip pancakes, fresh, light roast coffee, and a very subtle smokiness underneath it all, that I would attribute to smoked malt. No bacon, but I could definitely see maple sausage. It really does smell like a chocolate chip pancake breakfast with coffee. Palate: The beer greets the palate porter-first. It isn't pastry, and constantly remains real beer. A very nice porter base, too - roasty, but lightly so, with very little malt sweetness, and no char to speak of. A touch nutty, with a bit of cocoa and toffee. The maple is ever-constant, lending a faint background sweetness, while the coffee stays restrained, tasting not like grounds, but a smooth lightly sweetened cup of light roast. The coffee note opens up towards the finish, as the maple slowly subsides, letting a bit of meaty emptiness come through. It isn't quite *bacon*, but it's a nice touch, and I can pretend. The finish is light coffee, subtle cocoa, a trailing hint of maple, and a kiss of smoke.  Mouthfeel/Body: It's a 6.4% ABV porter. There's no reason to assume this will be thick or chewy, and it isn't. It's medium-bodied, fluid up front, but with some of that porter heft to it. It isn't thin, nor thick. It's right where it should be. Drinkable, not watery. Effervescence is medium - gentle, with fine, soft bubbles. Semi-sweet, with a moderately dry finish with lingering maltiness. An iota of stickiness.  Overall: This takes everything that the breakfast stout has made famous, and delivers it in a smaller porter format. The maple is beautifully integrated, the coffee is top notch, albeit a bit restrained, and there's a nice subtle smoky element threading through. The porter itself is fantastic, with the perfect malt bill and great attenuation. It's bold, balanced, and deviates from the norm. All of the breakfast stout qualities in a smaller, drier, drinkable package. Simply put, it's really a great breakfast porter."
2106,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.61,"Canned 1/5 drank from fridge on 2/6  Pours a turbid orange with a white head that lingers. Nose is fruit - orange, pineapple, mango, grass/earthiness/mild dank. Taste follows with fruit salad and bitter hops, with dominate tropical fruit (pineapple), and orange/tangerine. Nice bitterness to add some earthiness. Feel is medium of the pallet with nice carb. Overall, great IPA that has excellent NE vibes, but enough hops to balance the beer."
2107,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.5,"On tap at HF FOFA 2015. HF Taster glass. Clean, a hint of tartness, some oak, a little pepper and yeast. Endlessly drinkable. My favorite offering from HF at FOFA."
2108,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.44,poured into a taster glass via draft at Other Half's Pastry Town (3/16/2019) jet black color with minimal foam smell is a heavy punch of coffee and bourbon taste follows the nose low carbonation mouthfeel is full and creamy
2109,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.48,"2020 vintage opened on 11/22/2020  Pours a think used motor oil color with minimal coffee crema head. Nose is of barrel and vanilla, roasted malts, milk, minimal umami/soy. Taste of sweet milk, chocolate, vanilla, warm barrel character, finishes with a balanced soy flavor. Feel of 2% milk with mild carb. Overall, what a nice treat, great base beer that is exemplified by the barrel."
2110,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.71,"Bottle shared by Daniel. Thank you! Bright pink body with a thin, off-white collar that fades immediately to nil. Aromas of passion fruit, guava. Grandiose fruit character leaps out in the aroma. Tart, hard candies of assorted tropical fruit. Absolutely delicious."
2111,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,5.0,"Might be my favorite beer from Trillium, along with DDH Congress St and a few others I've enjoyed throughout the past few years, it's the perfect installment of Fort Point - DH Galaxy WINS. Smooth and balanced, Creamy Citrus and Pineapple is accompanied by gentle mouth feel. Mild finish, the daily drinker, and will impress any beer drinker."
2112,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.18,"Bottle at share. Dark brown, oily pour, tiny ring of head. Aromas and taste bring brown sugar, molasses, sweet. Slick and sticky.More roasty malts than coffee."
2113,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.18,"On tap Mission Dolores, Brooklyn. "
2114,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.46,"Good head production and decent retention. The body is wonderfully dark, as is the dark brown head, while it lasts. The aroma on this is powerful and decadent. From the moment of the pour, to sitting in the glass feet away, I'm getting strong notes of chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Up close, it's even sweeter, with vanilla, syrup, honey, and brown sugar joining the mix, along with cinnamon and chilies. The nose is, quite simply, wonderful. Despite the sweetness of the nose, the brew is quite roasty and bitter up front. Light but noticeable pepper heat. Tons of dark fruit flavor, blackstrap molasses, oak, and bitter chocolate; slightly vegetal. Lasting prune and raisin, along with bourbon, on back third, leading to chocolate and cinnamon on the finish. Thick and full bodied."
2115,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.88,"Had onsite at Anniversary 2017, and it was amazing. So different than regular Dorothy, wouldn't recognize the association. Barrel Dorothy was golden and slightly opaque, fluffy lasting head, fruity, mild barrel tones, and smooth. Unbelievable, must try!"
2116,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.58,"750 B1. Huge thanks to Matt for opening this one. Incredible raspberry nose. Amazing. Taste is mildly sour for a SP, raspberry and lemon. Very balanced. No harsh acidity. Truly amazing stuff."
2117,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.25,"Thanks for the share Bryan! This is just another in a long line of Tree House IPA I have thoroughly enjoyed. Flavor, aroma and mouthfeel top notch!!"
2118,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.59,"4 oz. onsite, ""2015 Aaron"" Nice deep maple-syrup color in the glass, small ring of foam clings where the liquid meets the edge of the glass.  Nose isn't huge but I'm getting primarily caramel/burnt sugar, dark stone fruits, something resembling maple syrup, but couldn't find the bourbon. Each sip starts with toffee, rock candy, sweet syrup, ending on something I wanna say is almost like black tea, with a little smidge of alcohol to cut through the sweetness. Again to my surprise not much in the way of bourbon, but I honestly think it was better for that.  Little carb, sticky and coats the tongue but nothing big or overwhelming, and sweetness is always pleasant and never cloying. Overall can't think of a single better barleywine I've had. Held in especially high contrast against a very bitter/medicinal/cough syrupy barleywine I'd picked up from a bottle shop the day before. Finishing this pour only renewed my efforts to try to land a bottle, definitely don't pass this one up if one comes your way."
2119,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.55,"Broke this treat out for beer 4,000. Bottled Sep 13th 2016, opened Mar 11th 2017. A - Golden hay body with one finger of bright white, loosely bubbled head. Low retention and lace. S - Barnyard funk with a fresh, crisp white peach. Really clean. T - Fantastic fruit character. Sweet raw peach, tart peach skins, soft wheat, tart lactic acid, and old wood. M - Wonderfully dry with a medium frame. O - An outstanding fruited saison. Leaner lives up to the hype."
2120,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.88,On tap at Lyon Bière Festival #4 off nights in La Crafterie. Amazing purple colour. 
2121,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,3.99,Growler. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Tangy citrus hops dominate the beer. Straight forward with minimalistic malt presence. Clean and refreshing. God body and mouthfeel.
2122,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.6,"Pours a hazy golden yellow with thick head and sticky lacing. Nose is full grapefruit, other citrus, floral, and hops. Flavors are very good, a lightly bitter hops with light grapefruit and other citrus notes, minor floral sweetness, and a very minimal pine, the finish is a little sweet malt and dryness, overall a complex mix that just eases you thru this beer, very impressed. I want to say for me this has a little west coast feel."
2123,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.5,"Look: beautiful, opaque garnet red. Soft white head evaporates quickly; no lace. Ring of tiny bubbles along the glass.  Smell: subtle sour raspberries. Some funk. All gorgeous. Taste: sharp, tangy, sour raspberry with some funk and vinegar. Beautiful rich fruit with sharp notes taking it up and up.  Feel: Lots of sharp, active, elevating tiny bubbles. Sharp on the tongue in the best possible way. This is a magnificent beer. All angles, sharpness, acid, funk, and fruit. And bubbles. It's alive..."
2124,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.59,"Batch 3 poured into de Garde shooter glass. Pours semi clear with minimal head that dissipates quick. Aroma is funk and oak. Flavor is an explosion of funk and oak...lots of barrel in this yet so perfectly balanced. Feel is high carb, light on the palate. Champagne like. Overall, outstanding wild ale. Funky, tart and oaky."
2125,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.53,"Pours a bark brown almost black. Thick and viscous looking as it pours. Finger of dense khaki colored head. Strong lacing.  Nose is smooth warming bourbon. Sits graciously rather aggressively. Roasty coffee. Rich, complex, detailed. Nice malt profile as well. Complimentary to everything else going on here. Very relaxed brew. This brew knows it's the most important one in the room and it doesn't have to announce its dominance. The waft of alcohol coming from the glass has no problem shouting it's presence on the other hand.  Taste follows the nose. Smooth, woody bourbon. Nice sweetness mixing with mild dark fruit notes. Big coffee providing a layer of bold, roasty bitterness. The coffee in this is very nice. Something that wasn't present on the nose was a little bit of chocolate. Mouthfeel is fullbodied with mild carbonation. Velvety smooth. I love the consistency of oatmeal stouts. Amazing stuff.  "
2126,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.94,This is an excellent A+++ premium Beer all the way!
2127,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.5,Blend 3. Nice cinnamon to the nose - slightly unexpected in a cherry beer. Rich and thicker than most cherry beers - none of the thin cough syrup that I've come to expect from cherry fruit beers and sours. Light barrel notes. Quite good. Really bucks expectations - I like this beer as much because of how it surprises me as how genuinely good it is!
2128,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.71,"12oz bottle of 2019. Coffee so well done as complimentary accent. Nose was far more dynamic on the bottle, and the taste was exquisite. More coffee presence than the previous batch. Loved it!"
2129,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.62,"16oz can poured into a tulip A- pours a slightly hazy orange color with a one-finger foamy white head that reduces to a ring around the edge S- herbaceous and loaded with tropical fruits on the nose; mango, guava, pineapple, passionfruit, cantaloupe and grapefruit zest. Undertones of milk sugars and vanilla T- bold tropical fruity hops up front with flavors of mango, pineapple, passionfruit and ripe melon, followed by a zesty citrus note of grapefruit and tangerine. Mid-palate brings out some herbaceous notes, along with a hint of milky lactose that adds an element of vanilla. The finish continues with a onslaught of tropical fruity hops and lingers of citrus zest, mango and hint of lactose sweetness M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns into a creamy, crisp finish O- an outstanding showcase of the mosaic hop that explodes with tropical fruits throughout"
2130,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.17,"Another one of the beers picked up from Treehouse during the late October trip to New England. This review is written after having the beer three times, once as an extra, once fresh, once 70 days after purchase. Pours a moderately yellow haze with 3/4"" white head. Has the basic proprietary dry hopping, Mosaic and Amarillo, two heavy hitters dropping plenty of nose candy in the form of citrus, hay and passion fruit.  Taste is another winner. 50ibu levels of bitterness saturated in aroma hops keep the notes of orange and grapefruit coming. Body is light pretty much just some pale toasted malt and 2 row. Might be a mild flaking of some alternative (non barley) grains. Slight green hop burn on it, far from problematic. Can still drink multiples of it. Its good stuff but it seriously has so many equals out on the left coast that aren't hyped to the same degree. I guess when you split stuff like this between 4 breweries versus hundreds in a geographic region, its bound to happen. In the end, a good beer done thousands of similar ways by different breweries in your local area."
2131,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.38,"2019 series. Bourbon, maple syrup, chocolate and coffee. This beer truly is world class. I would compare the mouthfeel to drinking chocolate milk. It is that creamy and delicious."
2132,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.15,750 into snifters. split 10 ways as befits a BT Pours dark brown and oily but translucent
2133,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,5.0,"Well there’s a lot of hype surrounding this beer. Big brew that “sold out” to anheuser Busch but people still flock to get it. The original bourbon barrel aged stout that so many others have copied. I finally found it in a local shop I’ve never been in before and they had six on the shelf. $15. I am drinking the regular flagship 2020 vintage so the bottle isn’t very old. Poured out into a snifter as suggested a deep dark brown with very little head retention. Smell is absolutely delectable. One of the best smelling beers I’ve experienced. It’s very richly bourbon, sugary, maple syrup and molasses. Just wonderful. Really makes me want to drink it. So I do. And it’s fanfuckingtastic. Rich fudge, maple, chocolate, vanilla, smoked out leather. And a huge chord of warming bourbon that fills the mouth a good half minute after swallowing. And mouthfeel is thick and juicy, moderate carbonation. Overall I’m impressed, and I love big stouts like this so I’ve had a fair number to compare it to. This brew is like an old rich guys high backed leather chair sitting in front of the fire wearing an ascot and smoking a fine cigar kind of delicious. I’ll definitely be returning to this again for special occasions."
2134,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.53,"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Aroma is tropical fruit with lemon. Taste is moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of lemon, mango, melon, pineapple, resin, caramel. As almost all of Trilliums beer very well done."
2135,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.29,"Canned 8/20/20. Tasted 9/17/20. Surprising that it's taken me this long to procure an Alter Ego. This is a really yummy beer, but it's not as rich or flavorful as many other Tree House offerings. Some folks really loved the smell of Alter Ego, but I found this to be the weak spot in this beer. It was a little murky and sour for my nose. But the taste was delicious, with a nice balance of dank bitterness and sweet/citrus fruit flavors. The feel, while a touch on the light side, was very smooth. The look was a slightly hazy orange - hazier than Bright, but less hazy than most other TH IPAs."
2136,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.44,"2018 release. A: Pours a very light pale, hazy, kind of berliner-like, with a cap of bright white head which quickly fizzles out to a sharp ring. Nicely effervescent. Minimal retention and no lacing. S: Moderate sour plum and grainy wheat, hefty amount of barnyard funk and a hint of spice. T: Rich juicy plum and wheat, light earthy funk, finishing with a crisp medium-light tartness on a fairly lengthy finish.  M: Medium-high, somewhat sharp carbonation. Light bodied. O: Tasty, refreshing, drinkable, and exceptionally well balanced. The sourness is restrained and the fruit is delicious."
2137,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.49,"(From a 4 oz. tasting of batch 3.) Cloudy but representative apricot color, and the fruit comes through on the nose in a nice reserved way, and then the taste stays right in step with the pace and expectation of the lead-in. I'm not a fan of sours and citrus-forward beers, so this sweeter fruit theme is more to my liking and is a beautiful offering for the type."
2138,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.1,"16 ounce can in a beer glass. It looks like a glass of peach juice. Modest white cap, decent lacing. Citrus, tropical, dank, alcohol, wet dough malt aromas. Taste follows the brewer’s description. Tropical fruits, citrus in the form of lemon rind, mango, earthy. Juicy medium body. Evidence of alcohol. Bittersweet. Not bad, though If I’m going for DIPA, I’ll look elsewhere."
2139,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.35,Thank you CanConPhilly for this
2140,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,3.99,"On tap in an Imperial style pint glass. A nearly clear golden colored brew with pure white cap, 1F, light sticky lacing. Tropical and citrus fruit aromas. Some grapefruit and tangerine with mango. There’s the obligatory onion smell common in an IPA of its abv. A bit dank. Mango and tangerine, pine, citrus rind. Some caramel sweets. Medium bodied, minimal hop bitterness. Mellow drinker with no alcohol burn. Citrus rind is present in the finish with some malt backbone. At 8.2% abv, it’s pretty clean. Good enough, but didn’t come close to the hype."

2146,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.99,"A - Dark muddled brown and red coloring with minimal small tan head that recedes back into the glass. Nice retention here. S - Cinnamon, Cherries, and whiskey dominate the nose followed by notes of funk and sourness.  T - Taste follows the nose with a blast of cherries that integrate well wight he tartness followed b notes of cinnamon whiskey oak and chocolate and vanilla all blend together from the 2nd use BA Abraxas Barrels M - Mouthfeel is spot on here with a medium bodied crisp mouthfeel and finish. Can't ask for much else here O - I am just astounded at what Corey has put out.... this and Oude Fermier and truly masterpieces that deserve the hype. This is comparable to a VSB type quality beer and perfectly executed for the style that it resides in. If you can get this, seek this out with confidence Re-review with a much larger pour. This beer is one of the most complex interesting beers that has ever touched my lips. "
2147,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.71,"Pours vantablack in color with a somewhat thin espresso head with decent retention; bitchin legs on the side of the glass. This beer has a lot of complexity... Smells rich of roasted malts, vanilla, dark chocolate, dark fruits, bourbon, oak, fair amount of hops, sweet, boozy. Taste very much follows the nose, has almost a spice like warming aspect to it, the booze is all there. Full-bodied, low carbonation, super warming, syrupy, thick, oily, chewy... Really quite phenomenal. A stout worthy of a celebration."
2148,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.77,Pours only slightly hazy with a good carbonation. The overall taste is smooth and slightly sweet. it has a slight lean toward orange and mango with good mouthfeel. It defies the 8%.
2149,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.46,"2014 bottle poured into a bulb. Beautiful color...deep ruby red. Smells of funky raspberry jam. Taste isn’t as expected as I was expecting more fruit. There’s fruit there just not as jammy as I had hoped. Still outstanding though. Feel is nice. What you’d expect for this style. Overall, excellent beer. So happy I got to try. Thanks Ray for sharing."
2150,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,5.0,"Not a beer, but an experience. Got my hands on a 2019 bottle. Don’t know if it will last out the year. I’m not going to describe it terms of flavors, more of what it reminds me of. It’s like a finely aged twenty year old port or a cognac without a big alcohol burn. It’s smooth, it’s rich, it’s bold and big and boozy and thick and just all around amazing. This was a long time want, and it lives up to everything I’ve wanted it to. Simply one of the best beers I’ve ever had."
2151,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.58,"Season 17|18 Blend No. 16 - drank on February 17th, 2020. Not quite the fruit-forward framboise that I'd expected, Framboos has quite a lot more oak and sourness than the tart berry that I'm accustomed to. The nose is wonderful, and the barrel plays well with the tartness. Beautiful pour, though not quite so dark as the krieks and framboises I'm more experienced with. Quite good."
2152,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.43,"12.7 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy burgundy wine color with a large effervescent pink head. Little retention or lacing as expected of the style. Bubbles for days. The aroma is fresh raspberry jam, blackberry yogurt, lemon zest, grass and hay, and a good amount of funk. There's a bit of oak and vanilla as well. The flavor definitely brings the tart: Lots of raspberries, black cherries and red wine vinegar, with plenty of lemon zest, pears, blackberries and lime juice. There's a wave of funk and grassiness before the oak chips and vanilla notes finish things off on a sweet and earthy note.  The feel is medium-light bodied with an exorbitant amount of effervescent carbonation. Very crisp and exceptionally dry on the finish. Overall, this is a fantastic...lambic? I suppose that's the proper style but I wouldn't bat an eyelash if this was labeled as a wild ale. Regardless, if you're looking for a fruit beer or a wild ale, this one is going to be right up your alley."
2153,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.33,"650ml bottle, snifter glass. Thick and opaque black body, one finger mocha head, good retention. Minimal lacing. Lots of coconut flakes. Smell is sweet, damp coconut water sweetness, big bourbon and oak, whiskey heat, vanillin, milk chocolate. Smooth and creamy milk chocolate soaked in bourbon, slight vanillin, sweet coconut water throughout. A little bit of toasted coconut as well. Full bodied, creamy and thick, viscous and chewy, good carbonation, coconut and bourbon heat all the way through to the end."
2154,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.74,Hazy yellow color without much head. Nose is like wild peach with fresh picked peaches. Taste is a lot of tartwith a lot of peaches. Feel is very full and enjoyable. This is a fantastic beer.

2156,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.77,"P: deep brownish black with a slight brown head which dissipates, stayed a bit stronger in the draft Bergson  A: Strong maple syrup goodness with French toast. Draft was pure French toast T. Sweet maple syrup up front followed by a strong roasted coffee and then gets more mapley on the back end. The coffee was a bit lost in the draft version but I did not miss it.  M: nothing bad, nothing great.  O: this is definitely a quality beer. It’s pushing to be overly sweet but the coffee works to balance it well. This definitely would be superb in a barrel."
2157,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.18,"Canned 11/27/19, “cause if I were here & you were there, I’d meet you in between” This is a seriously sweet and chocolate-heavy beer. It tastes like tootsie rolls. Delicious roasted malt and obviously a ton of dark chocolate added, which makes this a special beer that’d I’m glad to have tried but won’t buy again."
2158,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.36,"Canned on 02/09/18, 10:07:39. Pours an awesome orange color, hardly any head, it dissipates quickly. The nose is sweet and tropical. Lots of mango, hints of passion fruit , citrus throughout. Not getting any bitterness or booze. Very aromatic. A great balance of flavors hits right away. Lots of bitter hops upfront, earthy piney focus. As it settles your get more citrus flavors, namely grapefruit. While I do wish it was just slightly juicier, I love the contrasting profiles of the nose and flavors. Maybe having had this just a little fresher would have given me that fruitier presence. Pretty thin body, very crisp with a sharp, effervescent carb. Smooth finish."
2159,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.23,"Pours a hazy yellow orange color with a medium bodied white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet toasted malts then a big floral/piney and then mainly grapefruity hops. Tastes of sweet toasted malt and then mainly grapefruity hops and a hint of melon in there as well. Smooth, velvety, nice amount of carbonation. Overall, excellent beer!"
2160,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.49,"look: light orange, just a little hazy smell: floral,  taste: piney and bitter on first sip, some apricot and honeydew after a few more sips,  feel: smooth, medium body, finish is bitter overall: I feel disappointed, this beer is overrated I think"
2161,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.18,"This was a significant improvement on the base beer. Like the base, it tastes of licorice, raisins, and almonds. Some chocolate comes through as well. Its very rich on the nose and flavor. The base tastes course and artificial to me, but the bourbon barrel helps to smooth that out. I get a little vanilla from the barrel and I really like how the bourbon integrates with the base beer. The bourbon flavor is pleasant without excess booziness. The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium and there is a little chalkiness that detracts from the feel. Overall, its a very good beer with a few flaws."
2162,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.57,"Unsure of vintage. Poured into a HF bulb. Bright golden orange/yellow. Small head. Smells of oak and subtle funk. Some wine characteristics there as well. Flavor is so damn good. Some funk, tartness, white whine characteristics and oakiness. Amazing. Feel is spot on for the style. Lots of bubbles and very refreshing. Overall, a fantastic HF beer. Thanks George for sharing."
2163,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.9,Had this at a share in line for BA Chainsmoker....had been meaning to track it down! This beer was heavy on the coconut! Very impressive! Needing more!!!!
2164,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.5,"Pours a very hazy (ha) orange color with a very tall head on a gentle pour with long retention and clumpy lacing. The smell is tangerine, grapefruit, and citrus peel. The taste is very tropical forward with some dank, earthy hops. The finish is bitter with a nice malt presence. The mouthfeel is like a pillow - low/medium carbonation and medium/thick body. The finish lingers. Overall this is excellent. It has a beautiful mouthfeel and a great blend of flavors."
2165,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.9,"Appearance - The beer poured dark color with a creamy mocha head topping off the pour.  Smell - The sweetness of Dark Lord met with bourbon. The nose was sweet, but not cloying. Taste - What made this beer great was the sense of balance. The cloying, soy sauce-like, sweetness that many associate with regular Dark Lord is balanced with bourbon. What became of the combination is smooth sticky heat.  Mouthfeel - The beer was silky smooth with light carbonation and a slick sweetness. The body did not seem as thick as some of the other variants.  Overall - It is amazing what a plain bourbon barrel will do to Dark Lord."
2166,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.91,Need this again soon! Amazing dry hop that Alpine is known for. Smooth double ipa that starts with an amazing smell and ends with the perfect finish. My favorite double ipa!
2167,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.45,"I'm a coffee lover and I don't think I could last a day without it. I usually drink four or five coffees a day, and oftentimes, it looked as like my coffee grinder couldn't keep up. I was surfing the internet during my work break and I stumbled across a coffee-related site, [url]https://www.linlin.in.th/coffee-grinders/[/url], I saw they have a big plethora of coffee-related products so I ordered a small bag of coffee beans to see if my coffee would taste better. I was satisfied with the taste of the coffee and now I'm thinking about buying a coffee grinder since the pricing is decent."
2168,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.31,"Pours a hazy orange juice color smaller off white head, leaves some good sticky lace. Aroma is big citra notes just like you would imagine. Grapefruit, pinnapple, orange light herbal /pine bitterness. Taste is big citrus pinnapple, grapefruit, orange with light veggy bitterness with some herbal hints. Good malt base petty good testing IPA even if it's not as yummy as the hype led me to believe, still a solid IPA with a great nose. Mouhfeel is medium with medium carbonation. Overall an aromatic IPA, that's pretty damn solid."
2169,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.24,"Vintage: 2016 Appearance: Pours mahogany with a one finger beige head; dots and a few streaks Smell: Dark fruit (plum, cherry, and raisin) with toffee and Bourbon tones Taste: Toffee foward with the plum, raisin and, in particular, cherry emerging; there is an unusual herbal tone that is also in the mix; hints of Bourbon barrel, through the middle), with the sweeter fruit tones driving home the finish Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation; a touch of warmth in the gullet Overall: I get the reputation of Hill Farmstead and I have had some very good beers from them; I just don't think this is a top notch English barleywine; I like the dark fruit element (and that is creative) but this needs some hop tones to balance the sweetness - not American over the top hops; just some English hops and toffee to be more authentic to the style"
2170,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"Pours a little oily, pitch black in color with a small dark brown head, which recedes to a thin layer of lacing almost instantaneous. This smells of wood enriched dark chocolate, fudge covered molasses and toasty coconut. Additional aromas of flowery, ice cream sweet vanilla bark waft into the the nose, together with cinnamon, old, burned oak and a lighter, meaty smoke. This drinks thick, showcasing the beer‘s decadent body in a marvelous way, with almost no carbonation to speak of, but a creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Tastes of sweet coconut bark, and a melange of even sweeter vanilla and toffee, effectivly toned down by balancing bitter chocolate and an uprising Bourbon barrel presence. The oak barrels become more resounding then, joined by notes of black peppers, spicy licorice and molasses among a handful of ash. Finishes a little warmer, maintaining its intriguing interplay between the powerful barrels and the spicy, sweet adjuncts, topped off by brownie batter and well made, boozy pralines. This beer hits the spot. Its mouthfeel is simply smooth and decadent, revealing layers upon layers of whipped cream. This highlights especially the vanilla in this beautifully, which manages to gain a fantastic, sugary and floral depth which then gets balanced by the dry, oaken Bourbon barrels. The result is simply a truly complex and fulfilling imperial stout which leaves nothing else to desire."
2171,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.53,"16 oz can split with a friend, poured into a snifter. An OJ and tropical fruit bomb with a noticeable but not cloying malt backbone. Just a hint of pine to add complexity. Impeccably smooth and pillowy mouthfeel with no trace of alcohol despite the 8.2% abv. Overall a truly stellar (D)NEIPA from TH."
2172,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.46,"Pours a deep red with low, pinkish foam. Smell is tart with huge notes of cherries, backed by notes of almonds, raspberry jam and cherry marmalade. A hint of grass and lemon as well. Taste is sour, with controlled acidity and just a ton of cherries upfront. The back is balanced out with notes of almonds, raspberries, lemon, cherry marmalade and just a smidge of lemon peel bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated. Overall, a terrific sour, great balance and all the cherries you could ever want."
2173,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.46,"2020 vintage enjoyed in January 2021. Pours a dark brown color with beige edges and over a finger of tan head. The nose has notes of roasted malts with a touch of smoke. The flavor is complex - cherries and raisins meld nicely with the roast, dark chocolate and mild coffee. The body is NOT thin but also not as thick as I imagined it might be. The mouthfeel is creamy."
2174,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.36,"L - Nice translucent cherry red appearance, almost no head that lingers"
2175,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.12,"Drank from a 1 pint, 6 fl. oz bottle purchased at Cambridge Wine & Spirits, Cambridge, MA"
2176,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.88,"Look: oil black, thick khaki head with gorgeous lacing"
2177,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.63,"This is an extremely good beer. Drank it back-to-back with a 2018 Victory at Sea and in no way does this take a back seat. Dark brown, half-finger head with an aggressive pour. Perfect roasty nose. Not coffee, not shoe leather, not chocolate, maybe a combination of all three? Not sure but a very pleasant and unique aroma. I love this beer. Medium mouth feel, equally superb after an hour in the refrigerator as it is as close to room temperature. Easily sessionable. goes great with semi-sweet chocolate. My can was about 4 months old. I've also consumed this extremely fresh, loses nothing with age although the can recommends to drink fresh. Recommend highly and also recommend a trip to the brewery. Superb value at six 12-ounce cans for $16."
2178,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,3.99,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery tulip glass. A: Quite black, nearly opaque – though it looks fairly thin during the pour. Forms a thin tan head, and almost no visible carbonation. S: Rum, spices, wood and vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts, and ethanol burn. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from this. Maybe a bigger chocolate aroma. T: Rum, spices, chocolate and sweet sticky malts. Vanilla and woody dryness with ethanol heat, leather and mild dark fruit. Ethanol and rum spices with mild chocolate in the hang. M: The body seems a bit thinner than expected. The alcohol burn is significant, but not as much over-the-top heat as you might think given the listed ABV. Still, it's very “rummy”, and some sips just seem like chocolate-flavored rum. Low carbonation sensation. O: Good, but I'm not sure I like it as well as the regular bourbon version. Very rummy, and sweet. I’ll file this under the long and growing list of beers that I don’t think the rum barrel treatment was the way to go."
2179,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.29,Brewed 1/25/2018. Had trouble removing the cork and had the resort to a corkscrew. Poured most of a 500 ml bottle into a DFH tulip. The body was as dark as Rasputin's soul with an ample tan head. Drinking in a 58 degree room everything got better as it reached room temperature. At first everything seemed thin with the char dominating but eventually the other flavors prevailed. Never specifically noticed the anise in smell or taste but lots of dark fruits and barrel were present. Mouthfeel was fine for a big stout. Maybe I've been spoiled by BCBS and Jackie O's barrel aged stouts but this just didn't deliver what I was hoping it would. Maybe I'll try it again to see if this was just a subjective one time thing. It wasn't bad by any reasonable criteria but just wasn't the knock it out of the park experience I was hoping for.
2180,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.45,"Draught pour at The Smoke Shop. Nose is mute (opens up a bit once warm) , but the taste explodes with tropical fruit, papaya, guava, passion fruit, mango, kiwi, and some faint citrus. Creamy feel on the tongue and swallow, some ABV burn that drys the palate. Damn delicious brew, just wanted more from the nose."
2181,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.19,**
2182,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.74,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing. This one smells like roasted malt, caramel, coffee, oak, bourbon, vanilla, smoke, leather, maple, and dark chocolate fudge. This is just about as good as it gets for non-""adjuncted"" barrel-aged stouts. There's a ton going on here - it's primarily deep and fudgy. There's also caramel and maple sweetness, a bit of smoky bitterness, heavy roast, barrel vanilla, oak, toffee-heavy bourbon, and a little bit of coffee. This is hard to beat. This is silky, but not super thick, with a very high level of drinkability. It just feels good in your mouth, you know...nothing weird? I can see why Shaun thinks this is one of only a small handful of beers that he has nailed completely. It's really quite amazing. I bet Damon was a really loyal and excellent friend - to inspire a beer this well-crafted."
2183,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.64,"2019 vintage poured on dec 19, 2020  Pours a viscous used motor oil color with a mocha color head that leaves minimal lacing.  Nose is of dark fruit, vanilla, leather, dark chocolate, and faint oak. This is culmination of great barrel and base beer.  Taste follows nose with subtle dark fruit, dark chocolate, lingering vanilla and barrel character. The taste once again really showcases the great use of barrels and base stout.  Feel is where this beer falls short. It is slightly over carbed that thins out the beer more than desired on the pallet. However, beer is still medium body. As this sits for 45+ mins, the carb starts to dissipates and leaves a more velvet mouth feel.  Overall, excellently crafted barrel aged stout that showcases the use of great barrels and stout recipe. Unbelievable that this is non adjucted. I think the beer falls short on feel(but gets better once it sits open) but I would gladly drink another! I also do not think it is worth the price of admission, unless you are able to get it directly from the brewery."
2184,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.13,"Can from the brewery in Fort Point in Boston, MA, whilst in town for EBF. Pours a hazy bright orange with a white fluffy head and soft lacing, smells like guava-peach grape must and pine resin dipped citrus candy, taste is biscuity malt sweetness with hints of nectarine and tangerine, finishes with a mildly bitter white wine mustiness, light bodied. A dry and fruity pale ale."
2185,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.43,"From a 16oz can dated 9/29/20 into a pint glass. Props to Bissell Brothers for one of the coolest cans I've seen in a long time. All black with silver lettering and logo and with a beautiful black can top. Pours an opaque pale yellow with about one finger of thick, foamy white head. Amazing retention and decent lacing. Smells of tangy oranges and tangerines with a bunch of grapefruit and pineapple mixed in. Picking up some mango as well. Taste follows the smell. Juicy! Tropical and citrus fruits. Also a decent tangy bitterness that shows up well after the swallow. Soft mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation. Surprising bitter aftertaste. Overall, this beer deserves it's place on the top 250. Great brew. Thankful for a friend who visited Maine and was able to snag some of this."
2186,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.34,"Pours out as an opaque yellow color with a nice sticky white head on top. The smell of the beer has a nice pine and fruity aroma to it. The taste has a resin pineapple flavor going on, subtle sweetness up front and finishes on the sticky dry side. The feel is creamy up front, very soft overall and lingers in the finish. Overall it’s a very impressive beer. Definitely a fan!"
2187,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.74,"Fresh batch released on May 2017. Bottle splitted 4 ways. Black as night liquid with a foamy dark beige head. Nose is coffee, some notes of acidity (cherries or simply coming from the coffee?), chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, lovely! I can’t stop smelling the beer. Astonishing taste of well dosed coffee, residual sugar, milk chocolate, vanilla and bourbon, everything is so balanced, the glass clearly doesn’t last long, I would grab another bottle and drink it all! Abv% is hardly perceptible, medium to full body. One of the most amazing imperial stout I had the chance to drink!"
2188,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.51,"Canned 6/8 This isn't shy, but it isn't a palate crusher either. Hugely flavorful without being abrasive. Dank overall, some pine, overripe tropical fruit, and little citrus rind at the end. Some sweet caramel as well. Top notch."
2189,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.15,"Blend #3. A: Pours a pale orange, nearly opaque, with a half finger of bright white head. Pretty good retention and a bit of lacing. S: Juicy stone fruit (apricot), horseblanket funk, oak and a bit of spice (clove), light white wine and tropical fruit. Pretty appealing. T: Medium-high sour dominates the flavor, with a decent dose of apricot, a bit of vanilla, funk, and rounded white wine. Medium length finish. M: Medium-light body with medium carbonation.  O: The fruit is a nice addition to Saison du Fermier, but the sourness is a bit high. I definitely prefer the base."
2190,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.46,"Pours a hazy medium straw color, abundant foamy head that lasts. Huge hoppy aroma, loads of overripe mango, massive pineapple, dank guava. Some citrus as well. Remarkable. Very flavorful. Loads of ripe tropical fruits mix with pithy citrus notes. Very juicy, semi sweet with no bitterness. Good carbonation. Overall an excellent DIOA. Would buy again.  4/30/21"
2191,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.35,"Bottled 20/10/16, Blend No 2 of 16/17 season. Poured at refrigerator temp from 750ml bottle to tulip glass (ps, watch the cork when opening) Look: Slightly hazy and medium golden in color, nice white head with initial pouring, but dissipates quickly to a lace. Smell: Nice bright acidic smell up front, slight woody and hint of barnyard. Taste: What a geuze should be, refreshing, acidic, and with a good amount of barnyard, more than the initial smell suggested. Barnyard increases as bottle warms up. Feel: High amount of carbonation, overall a nice and light and easy to drink Overall:. Very enjoyable, tempted to get another and age it even longer, can be up to 20 years aged in bottle."
2192,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.13,2186
2193,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,5.0,"Beautiful rum soaked brownie batter. No booze. The best beer ever, even though it doesn't taste like beer. Truly sublime. The absolute best liquid I have ever tasted or smelled, and it's not even close."
2194,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.48,Mar 2021 Siesta Key Spring Break
2195,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.34,"Poured from fridge temp into a snifter. Pours a dark murky brown with quickly dissipating tan head. Nose is very bourbon forward, with notes of nuts, grapes, toffee, brown sugar. Taste is amazing. Feels like a 15 year old English barley wine laced with bourbon. Has those amazing bourbon notes, along with caramel, brown sugar, maple, cherries, and figs. Has a syrupy feel to it. It tastes great, but I must say it is not my favorite BA barley wine. That's not to say this isn't amazing - just didn't live up to the hype. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Overall, a great BA barley wine and worth seeking out if this is your style."
2196,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.5,"A: Pours a golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing S: A good mix of citrus and pine up front along with some lighter tropical fruit notes and light malt T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a wave of citrus and candied hops and then picks up the tropical fruit and pine. Moderate but aggressive bitterness that is balanced by some malt. Finishes with lingering candied citrus M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation O: A very good DIPA that is simply a classic, must-try brew. Aggressive, but still on the easier side to drink. Again, a must-try"
2197,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.71,"Purchased as a 4 pk from a chilled case. Consumed about 1 month after brew date. Nice gold color with moderate haze/no floaties, beautiful white voluminous head that lasts a awhile and leaves some nice lacing. Smell was more muted than I expected given the advertised emphasis on the hops, but the flavor was very nice and complex with no single flavor dominating. This is like a whole bunch of ingredients mashed up together, but in a good way so that nothing slaps you in the face as a single ingredient carrying most of the load. Yes, I did drink some from the can but no big difference from the flavor in the glass, and this one looks so nice it is a shame not to take in the visual pleasure. Overall really nice but the cost ($18/4pk) is off-putting since other darned good IPAs can be had for significantly less."
2198,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.15,"22oz bomber poured into a tulip glass. thanks Ray for sharing this Pours a orange lightly hazy body with a small white head that leaves a ring of retention. Smells citrusy, sweet, piney. Taste is lightly bitter with citrus zest and piney hops, a tad bit of honey with a sweet malt backbone. Medium body, easy going down for 9.5%."

2200,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.01,"From a tall aluminum can m this brew is a hazy, dark straw color with a thin white head. The aroma is very fruity...citrus and melon....orang and lemon peel and some fleshy grapefruit. Full bitter and aggressive flavor. Some alcohol warmth. Full body. Satisfying."
2201,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.57,"A: Pours a pitch black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing S: Roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, and a touch of vanilla T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the roasted malt, coffee, and cocoa. Picks up the dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and some dark fruit. Finishes with lingering roast, coffee, and chocolate M: Full bodied with low carbonation. Definitely on the heavy side O: An incredible coffee beer that makes for a great sipper. The coffee is front and center and gets complimented by the chocolate. A great dessert beer. Definitely worth checking out"
2202,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.29,"Canned on 8/5/21; consumed on 8/24/21 Pours an opaque, dark golden orange body capped with multiple fingers of rich, fluffy, eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a finger of creamy cap, large, frothy collar, and layers of dense, webby lacing almost entirely frosting the of the walls of the glass. Aroma bursts with attenuated fruit cocktail notes, devolving into peach gummies and leaning into greener tones of eucalyptus leaf and fresh aloe; a catty dankness and peppery spice sees scrapes of a hard minerality over the middle to orange zest and grapefruit peel with edges of bubblegum and moss closing. Taste opens with peach ring sweetness into nectarine and a citric twist of orange peel; grapefruit zest eases into a semi-earthy twang of crushed-vitamin minerality before revisiting tropical nectar capped with candied guava and accents of dry grass finishing. Mouthfeel shows a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation; a hoppy twang integrates a crushed-vitamin minerality with a taut bittering over the mid-palate and through the finish, while the overall consistency continues to highlight a minor grit, subtle resin, and underlying juicy quality throughout. Familiar fruit saturation with a distinctly dank, cooly herbal twist; this is Tree House nearing its eccentric best, merging their almost inimitable drinkability with a refreshing deviation from ripe fruit overloads in favor of a rawer, resin-focused hop integration. A deceptively diverse, intriguing winner."
2203,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.74,Great barrel. One of the best of the style. Love that smokey smell. Not much like regular expedition; this one is definitely focused on the barrel character. Amazing.
2204,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.9,Appearance:
2205,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.07,Look: Pours a vibrant pink color with minimal head
2206,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.21,"Pours a hazed red with a brownish hue. The fat finger of raspberry-tinted, light tan head quickly fizzes away to a wisp and a crown. The big, fruity aroma smells “pink,” with fresh, juicy berries, cherry, some solvent and light oak. More of the lovely vinegar acidity characteristic of Grand Cru shows up front in the taste, pairing nicely with the juicy cranberry, raspberry and cherry. The oak touch is refined, smoothing out both the juice and acidity in the finish. The aftertaste is only lightly puckering — a mixture of sweet and tart. Medium bodied at most with a slight oily slickness and light carbonation fizz. Almost shockingly juicy, while maintaining Rodenbach’s classic character. Makes for a delicious special-occasion treat."
2207,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.68,"Bottled on 1/6/2021. Poured into a snulip glass. It pours a murky, pretty, pastel color with a thick fluffy, milk-white head and abundant thick lacing. It's a beautify appearance. The strong, aromatic nose features lemon, orange, grapefruit, pineapple, ripe melon, and pine needles. I love the original King Sue but this blows it away. The lemon is tart and the grapefruit rind bitter but those flavors are perfectly balanced by the sweetness of the pineapple and melon. As it warms there is additional tropical sweetness on the back of the tongue and the resinous pine is more pronounced. It finishes with a hint of pepper and astringency. The mouth feel is thick and creamy with near perfect carbonation, and it's surprisingly quaffable for 7.8% ABV. I usually not a fan of the 500 ML bottle format but it works well here. Overall, it's wonderful to be able to purchase this gem locally and less than 3 weeks old."
2208,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.79,Much darker than your average barleywine. Dark brown almost black color that seems to split the difference between barleywine and stout. Nose and taste are pure cinnamon. Coffee takes a back seat but is still there. Barrel really shines as well. Great beer.
2209,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.56,Canned 7/14/20
2210,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.71,"So far, the best beer I've had from Three Floyds. Pour is just beautiful. Great head retntion and thick lacing. Taste and aroma are bright and tropical, some melon, stone fruits - lots going on. Feel is perfectly carbonated with just the right amount of body."
2211,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.49,"A- Hazy golden body. Two finger creamy cap with good retention. Small sheets of lacing form after each sip. S- Oh peachy beast. Great whole fruit, flesh and skin and pit peach authenticity. Stone fruit full on and in your face. Some lactic, funk and oak. Not much cognac here. Peaches and sourness are the driving forces. T- Sour peach saturation. Beautiful ripe peaches with tart and somewhat bitter skin notes. Strong lactic acid sourness. Peach pith and juice bordering on nectar level. Vinous oak with a slight touch of cognac. A bit of Brett funk as time goes on. MF- Crisp and light-medium bodied overall. A very high level of carbonation and a fluffy and foamy texture. Very sour and somewhat oily slick finish. Fresh peach nectar with a ton of sourness and a bit of funk/barrel character."
2212,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.75,"It has a signature scent of Belgian yeast, dark fruits and a hint of wine. There's a dark depth of roasted malts in the initial flavor that then brightens to a fruity sweetness. It's thin with a lot of bubbly carbonation. The finish is dry, funky and fruity, then finally a little bitterness. It's like a dark, funky champagne. Really fantastic. I give it a 5.7 out of 6."
2213,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.63,"Poured cold into a tulip glass and allowed to warm to cellar temperature. Dark brown in color (I'm guessing around 40 EBC), with a thick tan head that left some nice lacing as it settled. There's nothing subtle about this one. Huge aromas and flavors of caramel, molasses, dark fruit, and licorice, accompanied by notes of bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Very sweet and quite boozy, with a little sweetness lingering on the palate. These FW BBA barleywines are truly something special, and this one is well deserving of its lofty ratings."
2214,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.58,"Pours a very hazy, cloudy orange body with a two finger white head that reduces to a layer and leaves spotty lacing. Aromas are heavy citrus and pillowy clementine, fruity and Inviting. Taste is lightly sweet honey and pulpy citrus, tangerine, pineapple, almost no bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel - very soft and easy, I can’t believe this is 8.3%. This is a real winner. Delicious and so flavorful, yet balanced and delicate."
2215,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.34,Pours like orange juice with a finger of white head.
2216,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.68,"So excited to obtain one of these to sample, let’s give er a try! Hazy and deep golden with a fading white head, certainly looks nice for the style. Honestly, typical mosaic tropical nose is nice but nothing overwhelming here. Ok, wonderful flavor here! This is where this brew really rises above the rest of the hazy lot that’s all over the place now. Tropical and dare I say “just the right amount of sweet” with the perfect blend of gentle bitterness on the end. The feel on this beer is also top notch, prickly, creamy and just the right thickness. I’ve rarely been blown away by a highly rated brew, this one deserves it."
2217,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,5.0,"Pours glowing red in color with a foamy white head, receeding to a fluffy, small head. This smells of candided cherries, inheriting an utmost fruity and flowery composition, together with a lusciously fruit ripeness. Got a marzipan peak to it, revealing toasted cherry piths, as well as a subtle, funky leatheriness. The nose on this is simply phenomenal, revealing an intriguing complexity which is hard to find in a beer. Has a soft, vivid carbonation, which leads to a great refreshment in this light bodied, smooth drinking beer. This tastes of an initial, complex funkiness consisting of green apples, blue cheese and old basement, blended together with some additional leather, complimenting the uprising cherry fruitiness in this. The fruits got an intense ripe- and sweetness to them, featuring the unique marzipan flavor from the nose, as well as a gentle, subtle smokiness. Finishes rich and juicy with an underlying, balancing tartness, toasted cherry piths among a stony mineral quality, entagled into wet hay and lime zest, creating a refreshing, long lasting aftertaste. This is a perfect Kriek to me. The cherries in this work their magic in an astonishing way, they‘re incredibly prominent and complex, at the same time this drinks easy and simply enjoyable. The mouthfeel is velvet, yet sparkling during the finish, the funk is there too, together with a very well working tartness, which makes this quite unique, as far as cherries can define a beer."
2218,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.5,"Bottled on 9/18/2013 - consumed on 7/18/2021. Poured from a caged-and-corked 375mL bottle into my Drie de Fonteinen tumbler.  Cloudy cinnabar body supports a thin layer of very pale pink foam which dissipates to a vague collar pretty rapidly; poor retention, no legs.  Intensely, flamboyantly aromatic - suffused with bright berry, cherry, and fine aged red wine vinegar notes. Wild and complex. Bracing acidity, with pepper and mild cheese notes quickly overwhelmed by tart fruit. Perfectly blended lambic with nuts, peppercorn, wildflower, honey, and foraged greens emerging occasionally beneath the raspberry and barnyard notes. Some minerality but not too many tannins in the finish, which while dry, isn't puckering.  Milky, smooth mouth-feel - could do with a tiny bit more carbonation perhaps, but it isn't bad for the style.  A fitting tribute - one of the best examples of the style I've had in quite some time."
2219,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.55,"Black color with dark mocha head. Aroma is really spice forward with lots of cinnamon, rum and booze. Taste is desserty with fudge, chili, cinnamon and some heat on the finish. Full bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Quite nice but not such a huge step ahead of the regular."
2220,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.44,"2015 Vintage, 12oz waxed bottle L - Appearance is a deep dark brown, nearly black."
2221,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.85,"Pours an oily, night black color with a small beige head, receeding immediately to a small ring of lacing. Smells of toasted coconut, spicy licorice and warm oak. The nose isn‘t too pungent in itself with just a hint of vanilla hovering atop. Drinks utmost thick, oily with a decadent, smooth mouthfeel. The body on this is huge, heavy and complex.  Tastes of sweet milk chocolate, together with toasted, sweet coconut and a lighter, spicy, warming barrel appearance. Has an almost extreme oiliness to it, quite possibly from the prominent, flowery coconut in this, resulting into a decadent smoothness with loads of whipped cream. Finishes with even more chocolate covered spices, heavier on the licorice than on the barrel, leaving a longer lasting milk chocolate and licorice aftertaste on the palate. Yepp, this is sweet and decadent. Its standout aspect is its supersmooth, silk mouthfeel, highlighting unfortunately nothing in particular. The coconut is well integrated in this, while the bourbon barrel only plays a minor part, wasting a lot of potential to overcome the simple number of adjuncts in this, potentially creating a truly complex stout."
2222,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.58,"A: Pours a hazy golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a decent cap that leaves good lacing S: A mix of tropical fruit and citrus up front along with a dose of dank and earthy undertones T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the tropical fruit and citrus, quickly followed up by the dank, herbal, and earthy tones. Moderate bitterness. Finishes with lingering tropical fruit and citrus M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth O: A very good imperial version of Alter Ego that really hits with both the juicy and dank notes. Very easy to drink. Definitely worth checking out"
2223,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.74,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours motor oil black with quickly dissipating brown head. Nose is amazing. Spicy peppers, bourbon, tequila, molasses, cherries, chocolate, lactose, and a touch of wood. Taste is insane. Peppery spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, tequila, bourbon, brown sugar, blackberries, cherries, chocolate milk. It's definitely sweet, but not overpowering at all. The aftertaste is really nice - a touch of spice and bourbon. Mouthfeel is super creamy and robust. Overall, an amazing BA stout."
2224,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.6,"pours out a dark brown - black color, deep brown tinged brown head, sort of fizzy but hangs around for a while.  aromas are mellow earthy coffee roast, slightly bitter, slightly acidic, hinting at fruity quality. mellow chocolate in there as well.  palate is subdued coffee roast, earthy, slightly bitter, fruity notes of blueberry, bittersweet and milk chocolate, sugary roasted nuts, mellow brown sugar, hint of cream. as it warms the bitterness becomes a bit more harsh invoking an espresso like quality, some caramel sweetness presenting as well. the coffee flavors and sweetness become more robust as it warms, bringing a coffee whipped cream flavor, coffee candies, soft caramel, and melted brown sugar. mouthfeel is medium, sort of light for the style perhaps but i find that enjoyable as it makes it easy to drink, still has a nice creamy texture to it. overall very very nice coffee stout!"
2225,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.85,Poured from a three hour old crowler. 
2226,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.43,2016 release consumed 5.1.18. Amazing express of the style. Drinks soft and smooth for 20% abv. More like an old ale look but drinks like a stout. Heavy booze and chocolate.
2227,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.67,"One of the best barrel-aged barleywines and as a bonus, it's somewhat easily available in the Chicago area. Big bold flavors at every turn. Huge boozy nose. Much smoother finish than the smell would indicate. An excellent entry into the #BIL catalog."
2228,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,5.0,"poured a deep dark color with a coffee creme brown head. Nose is coffee,bourbon, oak, chocolate, roasted malts. Taste is everything in the nose with hints of dark fruits, molasses and some balancing hop bitterness. Hints of soy sauce as well. The aftertaste is full and round, creamy even. The best i ever had in a stout. Mouthfeel is thick creamy and smooth. Overall: even better than the regular, the best out there."
2229,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.94,"batch 2 drank in a snifter on 3/15/2018...bottle split two ways, so a massive pour and wow what a way to drink this beer look - pitch black, surprising 1/2 finger light tan head, tons of lacing, absolutely coating the sides of the glass and just stopping on the sides of the glass barely sliding down smell - tons of coconut and maple in the nose, barrel and chocolate and vanilla and way behind in the race, bold and lovely taste - barrel pops through a ton but maple and coconut holding strong. bitter dark chocolate coming through more and more with the vanilla still trailing a lot. Not a ton of vanilla. This is really incredible. Uniquely balanced. Bold and exquisite feel - elite. massive thickness. no booze whatsoever. drinks like its 10%. just mindblowing overall - worthy of the hype. Would love to try this again. Really an incredible beer and I will seek out more from JWB"
2230,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.94,Tasted from a crowler. Pours a super murky orange. Looks like orange juice. Thick white head. Aroma is big time citrus. Super juicy taste with citrus and some tropical notes. Minimal bitter bite. Very crushable. Excellent.
2231,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.74,"Bottle No. 26308 Best By: 03/2022 Notes of bright fresh peaches, pear, apple, lemony citrus, apricot, banana, peppery clove spice, wildflowers, barnyardy farmhouse funk, hints of leather, horse blanket, toasty hay, straw, caramelized bready crackery malts, vanilla, oak, with earthy herbal floral hops"
2232,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.61,Thank you BartS for this
2233,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,"This review is for the 2019 batch. It was bottle number 43, tasted as part of a dinner at Toppling Goliath. Poured as dinner was served, thick and almost black, allowed to warm and enjoyed as dessert. On the nose, bourbon and maple syrup. Thick mouth-feel, and full of flavor. I have had the 2020 version on tap, so comparing the two is difficult, however I think the 2019 aged nicely and was, in my opinion, the better of the two."
2234,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.53,"This is a lovely looking brew. Golden liquid with a considerable amount of haze. Firm white head with a decent size, good retention and lots of lace.  Nose is a delightfully malty, hoppy and enticing combination. Malt has lots of toasted grains and light sweetness. A light bit of sharp alcohol is the only hint of the abv. Hops are healthy and dank. Tropical fruits abound. Citrus cuts across and makes it quite hop forward. Taste is super. Big malt core wraps itself around my tongue. Pilsner like and lightly sweet.Then BAM! Citrus and tropical hops flood the mouth. Hop oil and pineapple, bread and mild grain sweetness. Finish is clean and dry and shortish with lingering oil and grains. No trace of alcohol in the flavor.  Feel is superb. How a beer this big can be this light and creamy. The malted oats really shine here. Silky swallow, crisp carbonation. Just top notch.  This is a such a great beer. Quenching and easy drinking. You could fool yourself into seasoning it until you fall on your face. So tasty and satisfying, I can go for another, and another, and another,"
2235,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.9,Had this at a share with a few friends as we continue our quest to try all of the top 250. It is really good no doubt. I personally think it is better than Fuzzy.
2236,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.7,"Poured a thick black almost like oil with very little brown head, Smell is maple, bourbon, coffee, and chocolate with some booze. The flavor is more of the same with a smooth feel. An amazing beer!"
2237,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.53,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a KBS snifter. Canned 12/19/19. Pours very dark, some light still visible through the pour. Very small head, maybe the width of a pencil that fades quickly and leaves a tad bit of lacing. Smells of coffee, maple, roasted malt, slight notes of chocolate. Taste is other worldly. So much complexity. I get chocolate, coffee, and maple notes. The mouthfeel is decadent. One of my favorite beers to date with how thick and creamy it is. Overall, I think this is the best non-BA stout I’ve ever had."
2238,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.35,"Bottle. 5/1/18 bottle date. Appearance: Crystal clear, golden, with a low lying white head. "
2239,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.71,"375 ml bottle poured into a teku at a share.  Pours slightly golden with a pinkish hue. Minimal head that dissipates quick. No lacing down the side. Champagne like bubbles.  Aroma is funk, tartness and sweet plums. Smells absolutely fantastic.  Taste is amazing. Super balanced. Fruity and funky but not overpowering in the funk area. Subtle tartness to balance out the plum. Simply delicious. Feel is thin and light as expected for this style. Bubbly with lots of carb.  Overall, this is an amazing Flora variant. Maybe my favorite. The addition of plums makes this super delicious."
2240,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,3.45,"Grey Monday '14 on 181225 Pours an oily almost black color with no head at all. Smells of honey, scorched malts, spicy molasses, toasty oak and a faint hint of heated hazelnuts. Offers no carbonation at all, the beer itself has a thinner mouthfeel with a relatively well working boozy edge. Tastes of alcohol soaked praline, caramel and a touch of toasty hazelnuts. Brings a huge rock sugar impact to the palate, effectivly dissolved in the licorice and scorched malts. Offers a pleasnt milk chocolate flavor, covered in caramel and maintaining, dry, not sharp oak.  This is pretty good for a liqueur and very strange for a beer. Drank it with five persons, none too many."
2241,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.74,"Pours as black as ink with a 2 finger thick foamy brown colored head that made crackling sounds as it dissipated in average time, leaving minimal spotty lacing. The smell is really complex and rich with woody notes, dark rum, coconut, chocolate syrup, vanilla, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, piney accents, molasses, chili peppers and more sweet chocolate aromas. Wonderfully put together, the rum and extra vanilla notes kick it up a notch and make it a better version of the original Bomb!. The taste is where this one really excels. If you enjoy the original Bomb! and appreciate rum, then like me this brew is for you. The extra vanilla, cocoa and coffee bring more flavors and deeper components that let the sweet coconut and roasted malts tie it all together without actually being cloyingly sweet. This masked the ABV perfectly, but there was a little heat from the chillies. Like the nose the combo was dynamic, with dark rum, coconut, dark chocolate, woody notes, chocolate syrup, vanilla, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, piney accents, molasses, toffee, espresso, chili peppers and some minor metallic aspects. A world class stout."
2242,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.63,Pours more like a west coast IPA with a dank nose. Surprising mild flavor with super smooth finish. This is really a nice beer and super juicy. Very good.
2243,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.51,"2020 12 ounce bottle poured into a DFH tulip. Inky dark brown body through which no light travels topped by a small dark tan head which quickly dissipated to a thin ring. Smell is of vanilla, bourbon and malts; can't detect any coconut. Taste is very full and complex with shifting tastes blending together including a hint of coconut on the back end. Really a rewarding sipper and typically of Prairie stouts nothing is out of balance. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style. A home run."
2244,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.57,"I'm normally not the biggest fan of traditional American IPAs; however, this is one of the most balanced and flavorful. Poured from 12 oz can to a traditional pint glass. L: Clear and clean amber color with a short head. Not much head retention, but looks great in a traditional pint glass S: Fairly aggressive smell that lets you know exactly what you're in for. Aroma hits you without a deep sniff in the glass. Most of the aroma is a resinous hoppy smell with some more subtle tropical fruits T: So balanced! For 100 IBU, the beer is not overly bitter. The beer is packed with fruit on first taste which transitions to a piney resinous finish that balances the tropical fruit flavors. I was really surprised how the bitterness hides within the beer, but is still present throughout. This made my drinking experience extremely pleasant. For such an aggressive beer, it's extremely approachable. F: Clean and moderate mouthfeel. Carbonation is moderate. Lives up to the hype! Great beer, and my new go-to American IPA!"
2245,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,5.0,"Picked-up a few cans at Tree House Brewery in Charlton two weeks ago. My one hundred and tenth brew from these guys. Have been wanting to try this for a long time. I actually had one in my possession last year, but ended up trading it (& a Very Green) for a PTY. This lives up to the hype. Nice to see TH making whales available more often. Very Hazy?"
2246,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.46,"16oz can, date stamped 09/24/19. Hazy copper colored ale with a a foamy beige head that slowly fades into a thick foam. Rich hoppy aroma with plenty of caramel malt, tropical fruit, and citrus. Nice sweet start on the palate with caramel, grain, and honey, followed by some more bitter flavors of pine, orange & grapefruit zest along with tropical fruit notes of mango and guava - great complexity! Full body, resinous, ample carbonation, alcohol is well concealed, bittersweet finish. Exceptional beer! I might have to get another can if I come across it again."
2247,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.49,"Lp kriek '13 vintage Pours a vibrant ember to lilac color with a fizzy, bubbly head, leaving back a thick film of lacing at the rim of the glass. Dusty, leather accompanied, funky cherry from the very first smell. Produces a ripe, dark sour cherry impression, while ensuring an intriguing complexity, due to wood bark, dried oak and heated cherry pit among a fermented tartness. Drinks soft and perfectly balanced, while adding a subtle dryness to the uprising, associated tartness during the finish, exhibiting the beers flavor richness perfectly well. Amarena sweet cherries among a pleasant, earth coated funkiness, showcasing the fruits ripeness with a sugary peak to them. The beer produces a prominent stone quality among a dusty, pleasantly pungent funkiness. Utmost fruity in the finish, featuring almost overripe, juicy cherries in all its facetts and layers. A different beast than their regular Kriek, way more complex and fruitier. The sherries establish a fantastic characteristic between lusciously ripe, and already fermented fruits, tied together by a crisp, citraic sour punch."
2248,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.03,"Poured from a 750 growler into a snifter. Thanks Rich for hooking me up with this. Pours an amber slightly hazy body with a big frothy white head that reduces to leave heaving lacing and retention. Aromas are floral, resinous, light citrus, dank, piney. Taste is very floral, herbal, grassy, finishes dry. Medium body with medium carbonation. Glad I got to try it. Delicious DIPA from HF."
2249,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.78,L: A thick black liquid with a small off white head.
2250,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.83,Glorious! This hits every sense in a magical delightful dance. Smell of salted roasted peanuts. Sip the chocolate and I feel home.
2251,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.45,"Black color with a ring of brown foam. Aroma has lots of roasted malt, some umami and boozy bourbon. Taste is roasty, savory, chocolatey with some dark fruits on the finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Quite nice but not as spectacular as expected."
2252,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.43,"L -- Pours a lovely mahogany-brown body with a massive, pillow, three-finger off-white head produced with gentle pour. Fabulous retention and good lacing"
2253,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.27,Brown appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a pleasant chocolate malt. Taste is a slightly sweet also a pleasant chocolate malt.
2254,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,"A huge thanks to GrumpyOldTroll for this one.  12oz. can into Night Shift stemware.  Nose is pineapple, kiwi, pear and apple. There's a slight citrus fruit zing with copious amounts of cane sugar and a touch of creaminess. Nice and balanced with a great fruit bouquet. Beer opens dank papaya, pineapple, lychee and pear. Some mango in the middle with an awesome pulpiness that finishes cane sugar, more lychee, pear and apple. Absolutely delicious. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Soft and pillowy on the palate and goes down bone dry with a dry, lingering aftertaste. It doesn't get more drinkable than this.  I'm actually surprised that Hill Farmstead finally started to can their IPAs. That being said, I'm glad because it really is a gift to the masses who are able to get their hands on this."
2255,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.5,"Pours a classic treehouse cloudy yellow orange color with a light white head that fades to a thin layer over the beer and laces nicely down the glass. Smells of sweet cut grass and some citrus and melon notes at the end. Taste is grassier than the citrus/melons but still nice since it is an IPA. Feels a bit crisper than other Treehouses with as always the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, a great beer,"
2256,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.42,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 8/20/20, so 7 weeks old. Looks very good in the glass somewhat hazy dull pineapple juice colored body. Decent white head shrinks to a ring and solid covering. Excellent lacing, a feature of TG beers. Pleasant dull tropical fruit aroma. On tasting, it's one of those beers that you want to drink way faster than you should. Sweet, hoppy, lightly bitter, abv nigh on invisible. Citrus noses ahead of non citrus. Mouth closer to full than medium, finish fruity bitterness, and finally a little warmth confirming the presence of alcohol. Overall, just another great beer from these guys. Happy to have another 3 cans in the fridge."
2257,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.44,"I've kept this aging in the bottle about a year I think. It needed aging because it first tasted somewhat raw, not as good as the regular Plead the Fifth. Appearance: brownish black with a very short head, hints of copper and dark red when strong light is shined through the head. Aroma: sweet light molasses and sugar Taste: pronounced molasses and malt notes with counter-balancing, almost appropriate bitterness."

Settles into floating small bubbled island and thin collar of bubbly foam. Aroma is bright tart fruit mixed with a layer of overripe/fermented apricot. Minor but persistent funk, a hint of white wine grape and some earthy/grass/wood notes. Moderate carbonation and lighter side of medium body. Overall a beautiful representation of apricot. Perfect levels of fruit/funk/tartness"
2260,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,5.0,"I am not always a big fan of barleywines, but this one absolutely knocked my socks off. Everything about this big boy is, paradoxically, in your face, and yet, very nuanced. Lots of candied molasses, toffee, caramel, drambuie, cognac, orange and lemon zest, kiwi, strawberry, dates, vanilla, oak, and even a touch of the kind of tartness one might find in a world class lambic. I paid around fifty for this bottle of Batch #1, and I've seen them selling on the internet for at least twice that (and it would still been well worth the experience."

2265,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.19,"2017 vintage. I have had this one sitting around for a while. Pours a dense jet black color with no light coming through. Surprisingly good size (medium) dark tan head. Filmy tan lacing on the glass. Rich malty aroma and flavor. A little a coffee, some chocolate. not much of the bourbon, but definitely some oak that adds a touch of bitterness to he mildly sweet flavor. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Some warming alcohol presence but no ""bite"". Goes down very easy. This is a top shelf stout!!!!"
2266,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.6,"OGV 2016  Poured from fridge. Straw color (orange wine) with a white head that leaves slight lacing around the circumference. Nose is strong mineral with white wine and oak, barnyard, lemon, pepper, some funky cheese. Taste is mineral vinous and oak up front, barnyard funk, lemon peel, orange, slightly peppery. Dry on the palate, slightly over carbed - gin fizz like. Overall, very complex and substantially better than the 17/18 A&G I had less than 24 hours before. Excited to see how this cellars"
2267,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.5,"I've nearly managed to try Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake stout on two or three occasions now - this time, it did not elude me! I also had the pleasure of trying this side by side with the non-barrel-aged bottle - and while this experience certainly hurt my teeth a bit, it was a pretty great time to be alive! I've had my fair share of sweet, sticky, dessert beverages, but there's just something about Angry Chair's dessert stouts that surpasses everyone else's attempts - the beers are practically simple syrup in consistency and taste, but then they're also quite high in ABV, and don't taste it for a second. BAIGCCS is like a bucket of fudgy chocolate cake batter goodness - it coats your glass and it's absolutely opaque. The carb is so minimal that it's like drinking a light viscosity glass of motor oil. A delicious one, obviously. The nose is rich and warm, and that chocolate is just excellent on the nose and in the taste buds. I really liked this beer - but as I told my friends, I think this will be the only time I'll ever drink it, and I'm honestly pretty okay with that. It's just too much - there's no moderation to this beer. It's a bottle that you essentially need to share, because the flavors and syrupyness of the beer is just unrelenting. In all, like many of Angry Chair's beers, it's a tremendously compelling novelty - I really enjoy, and would certainly recommend it... but I can happily live without it ever again. Yum and done, basically."

2270,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.21,"2017 vintage, served just above fridge temp in a warm room, got a pretty wide variety of tastes and smells as it warmed up. Pour is dark, not viscous or oily. Dark brown, not opaque. Some light around the edges. Minimal dark tan bubbles that fade quickly. Alcohol legs on the glass. Smells of pipe tobacco, dark chocolate, raisins, plums, licorice and bourbon. Hints of burnt carmel as it warms. Taste follows the nose, not too heavy on the tongue, though it definitely lingers. Dark chocolate and fruits dominate the palate, with caramel and bourbon notes rounding it out. Excellent beer, I've heard other vintages were far more viscous and intense."
2271,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.75,"Can dated 4/5/21. Poured into a spiegelau glass.  Look: Pours a deep orange with some slight murkiness. Thick fluffy white head that leaves significant lacing. Perfect haze.  Smell: Tropical fruit right up front but much more earthy, almost hoppy on the nose. The malt is apparent. Not a standard juice bomb by any means.  Taste: Fantastic to put it lightly. Citrus, passionfruit, some peach and mango. Finishes with that perfect blend of flavors throughout with almost no bitterness.  Feel: Perfect, pillowy mouthfeel. Creamy on the back and and incredibly smooth. Dangerously easy to drink.  Overall: Easily apparent why Julius is an all-tiem great for the style. Other beers have definitely caught up a bit but this beer is still a good ways ahead of the majority."
2272,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.65,"Black color with brownish head. Aroma is a bit spicy with chocolate notes, bourbon and some booze. Taste has roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, bourbon in the background. Medium plus body with soft carbonation. Overall it's a really nice, well rounded imperial coffee stout."
2273,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.8,"Commonly regarded as the best barrel-aged English barleywine in the U.S., hopes are extremely high. Aroma is a tad overwhelmed by the high ABV, as I’m finding it difficult to find complex characteristics through the alcohol burn. Pull the glass away a bit, and you can pick up aromas of sweet, caramel malts, coconut and vanilla truffles. After the first sip, I understand the reputation. It’s so incredibly balanced, with flavors dominated by oak-derived coconut, old leather, booze soaked raisins and creme brûlée. This base beer was brewed for barrel-aging. It spent years expanding and contracting into the American oak staves, wading through the spirits that previously resided there. It lets the barrel shine, but maintains its own identity. Finishes with mouth-numbing alcohol, but the slick coconut flavors last for minutes after. It’s absolutely epic, and outside of 2016 Whiskey A Deal with the Devil, it’s the best barleywine I’ve ever had. Unreal."
2274,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.16,"12 oz bottle from Total Wine in Bradenton, FL.  Pours a beautiful tar black into my Funky Buddha snifter with a fingernail of brown head that dissipates as soon as it forms.  Rich aromas of toasted coconut, chocolate, coffee, and winter spice. Slight peppermint.  Flavor is spicy coffee, coconut flakes, then a fudge-chocolatey flavor extending towards the finish and stays on the palate.  Feel is a bit too carbonated but has a slick feel and a medium creaminess. Overall, while this isn't nearly as good as its barrel aged metamorphosis it's a good beer nonetheless. This is a perfect instance where bourbon barrel aging (Last Buffalo In The Park, one of my top 10 favorite beers) takes this beer and completely elevates it to a different level. Last Snow is a phantom, a shadow, a whisper of what Last Buffalo is. It's like the training wheels on a bike vs a monster truck. The seed to the tree. Bottom line, get your hands on Last Buffalo, and if you can't, try this as a consolation."
2275,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.45,"Those of you that actually read past the fact sheet on my reviews know that I carry a strong inherent bias against pastry stouts because I don’t handle sweetness very well. Some of you may have also noticed that I don’t seem as disenchanted when it comes to barrel-aged stouts and barleywine, when they sometimes taste as sweet, if not sweeter than other representations of pastry stouts available on the market. Besides the actually unendurable levels of sweetness that set light up my TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 with the force of hellfire, the thing that puts me off most about pastry stouts seem to be the driving force behind its popularity. I’m not going to straight up say that I don’t like pastry stouts because of all the hype and attention they receive, because I myself am guilty of buying into beers and brands that receive hype and attention and actually enjoying them every once in a while, but it’s probably because one of the things I value most about beer is that it’s proletariat and ubiquitous in nature; if I like a beer, I want to be able to reach out into my fridge and grab another one, or run to the store and buy another without feeling like I could have done better things with my money—the reason why I value mouthfeel so much in a beer is because I personally believe that correlates most strongly into how repeatable a beer is no matter how flavorful or unique tasting a brew should be, I normally won’t want to try another unless there’s some sense of balance or leveling factor that clears my palate for the next sip. Given my totally made-up standards and personal values stated above, pastry stouts couldn’t stand any further from brews that I would normally be willing to pay an amount of money or stand in line for. I’m pretty sure this comment will come back to bite me in the ass when I find myself standing in line for BA Double Stack next month, but I digress. Some (actual) preliminary thoughts about this beer. Apparently German Chocolate Cake doesn’t really come from Germany, and despite its name, its main highlight is whipped cream and the coconut-pecan frosting that’s used to fill the cake. On a more relevant note, this beer is best summed up by contrasting it to the beloved Street Fighter ZERO character Hibiki Dan. So for those of you that aren’t millennials or were living under a rock when Street Fighter, Dan’s character was created as a parody of SNK’s King of Fighters franchise characters Ryo and Robert, who very suspiciously resembled Street Fighter’s two most recognizable characters, Ryu and Ken. Outside of having twisted mannerisms and catchphrases suspiciously resembling the two SNK characters that were ripping off Capcom characters that he was ripping off, Dan is kind of memorable for being all show and no power whatsoever; his super/EX combo finish, Shinkū Gadōken, for example, looks awfully similar to Ryū’s Shinkū Hadōken while doing 1/40th of the damage it does—many-a-times have I sat in front of the TV screen, thinking “oh shit I’m fucked” when I saw the screen suddenly turn red, orange, and yellow while CPU Dan caught me off guard with my HP at 30%, only to realize my character was still alive after being hit by ostentatious super combo. Labored metaphors aside, BAIGCC is similar to Dan’s super finish in that it packs all the flavors it purports to deliver in one ginormous, sugar-spice-and-everything-nice upside your head, but then presenting a rapidly drying finish, which makes you feel stupid for cringing and bracing for impact—it’s hard to explain in close detail, but it’s like the opposite of getting a penicillin shot at the doctor’s, where you don’t feel the needle going in, but it feels like somebody injected the meaty part of your butt cheek with peanut butter for the rest of the day."
2276,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,5.0,"Shared with a good buddy in Denver. Little 2 man share so boss pours for both of us. The nose was explosive peach and funk... incredible!

2277,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.6,"L - pitch black with a two fingers mocha head S - cinnamon, cocoa powder, walnut T - very spicy with habanero pepper and cinnamon. The bourbon aging smooths the whole thing out. It also brings some coconut notes. Some vanilla is noted but I don't know if it's from the vanilla added or the barrel aging. Certainly has a bite M - very thick and smooth with a fine carbonation O - A world class beer from these guys once again. Nice!"
2278,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.6,"Gold pour, hazy, larger head. White wine, grape, oak, yeast, slightly catty, citrus aroma. Nelson and citra hops give way to yeast, oak, white wine, white grape. Slight catty taste. Lighter body, drying mouthfeel. Stellar"

2280,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.52,"Pours a clear, deep, dark ruby red coloration with a small, fizzy head that fades to a thin ring around the glass almost instantly, with very slightly visible carbonation. Smell is quite dominated by a lovely tart red grape aroma, with milder notes of blue cheese funk and musty oak, as well as just a hint of red berries and mild tannins. Taste is an excellent balance of quite vibrant, slightly tart red grapes, some light blue cheese funk and a distinct, mildly tannic, musty oak presence, as well as subtle hints of red berries, lemon peel and balsamic vinegar. Finishes quite dry, with a light tartness and some red grapes and musty oak lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/strong carbonation. While the sour and funky notes are a lot more subtle here than I expected, this really makes up for that with an absolutely sublime balance of vibrant fruit character, strong oak presence and funky highlights, while also displaying quite a dry body rounded out by a light sweetness. The red grape and berry notes, as well as mildly tannic, musty oak lends a certain vinous quality to this that is quite pleasant and also enrichens this with a certain depth, while still remaining quite refreshing and easily drinkable at the same time. A superb Lambic overall, that is perhaps not quite as rich and complex as other examples of the style, but makes up for that with a subtle, nuanced balance that is absolutely sublime."
2281,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.56,"Great beer! Great hit of fresh hop aroma on opening. Also a fan of the ""regular"" IPA from them. My local beer store (MetroWest Massachusetts) has both regularly and they are usually one to two weeks from canning. Not too boozy for a 8.2% so be forewarned ; )"
2282,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.72,Completely unreal thick. Had a 2016 cellared for 4 years. Chocolate and bourbon and a boozy but smooth element. Torquey at almost 20%. All the elements of a world class stout with chocolate and vanilla and tobacco. A dessert

Huge formation. Nice retention. No lace. Sweet vanilla nose, quite subtle, roasted chilies, some green olive. Taste is super tangy and fruity with some unlikely acidity and quenching character. Lighter palate. Palate is very soft, muted booziness, some heavy dark chocolate with lemon acidity. No apple brandy character I can detect, and I just spent 10 days touring the calvados region of France. Palate gets quite chalky and powdery. I like the acidic lemon and very bitter cocoa powder and dark chocolate, but there’s no barrel character at all. 6/4/7/4/13=3.4"
2284,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.75,"A: Pours a hazy yellow orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a decent cap that leaves good lacing S: Huge waves of tropical fruit up front along with citrus and floral notes. Pineapple and guava stand out T: Follows the nose. Starts off with tons of tropical fruit followed by some lighter citrus and floral notes. Again, pineapple and guava stick out along with orange and grapefruit. Light bitterness. Finishes with lingering tropical fruit M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy O: An amazing NE IPA that is incredibly easy to drink. Super saturated Green meets a slightly lower abv Very Green. Highly recommended"
2285,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.08,"January 1st, 2016 - Also kicking off 2016 is a beer from almost a decade ago: the 2007 Cantillon Lou Pepe. Our assumption is that this is perhaps a little long in the tooth, even for a mythically legendary beer like this, but I have high hopes and great trust in the Belgian craftsmen who have honed this recipe through generations. And it seems that my trust was well allocated, because the smell is absolutely beautiful. Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength. But the taste is spicier, and while it borrows some of the chocolate from the nose, it expresses more like a mole with that kick. Absolutely fascinating, and delicious, this has aged quite wonderfully."

2288,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.12,"L: Pours a brown-black with a perfect deep mahogany head which does not dissipate too quickly.  A: slight oak and cocoa overpowered by cinnamon and a spiciness T: Fudgy up front followed by a perfect spicy chocolateness and really a great mole character which I what I think is their goal. Almost taste like a cinnamon graham cracker in the beginning.  M: Slightly thin for a beer of this stature, but the medium body is welcome with the spice complexity.  O: Finally glad I got to enjoy this one I’ve been seeking for years. It’s a well crafted beer and one of the best spiced beers I’ve had."
2289,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.49,"Bottle from The Beermongers. Thanks, Sam! A clear golden yellow with a dense white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is pretty excellent, a soft, bright tartness,with notes of key lime, lemon, a light, lightly toasted French oak note, mildly vinous and fruity. There's a little grape, and a real nice Brett expression, lightly spicy with a little clove and pepper and a touch of pineapple juice to go with a mild floral honey note. Really nice depth and structure.  The palate opens tart with a nice blend of lactic and lemon acidity along with a really nice Brett funk. The lactic acidity is sharp but fleeting, priming the palate for the fruit that follows. Delicate pineapple, grape, peach and honey are present. Minimal straw notes. The Brett expression is restrained but thoughtfully executed, pairing nicely with the oak notes, tannins, light vanillin and almost vinous notes. Drying, mildly tannic and earthy on the finish, long lasting with firm acidity. Light in body, crisply carbonated, nicely structured. Impressive."

L: 1F fluffy white head with pretty good retention. leaves lots of white lacing with a partial cap. Beer is a hazy orange juice color. S: Grapefruit and lots of different tropical fruits. A bit of dankness and earthiness. Classic TH IPA nose. T: You get the juicebomb of grapefruit, guava, pineapple, and what I am guessing is the jackfruit (no idea what that tastes like). Finish is slightly dank, slightly earthy, very slightly bitter and lingers for a long while.  F: Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, would say this is unusually well-balanced and constructed even by TH standards. Entire drinking experience is a pleasure.  O: Superior IPA."
2292,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.86,"Been cellaring this one for a few years now and felt like this holiday was an appropriate time to bring it out. Not sure how available the '12' is in the US anymore but I know I was very lucky to find it. In fact, the obscure little wine shop in Baltimore where I bought the only two they had is not in business anymore. Drank the 1st one two years ago and it was memorable. The one tonight is just as exceptional. Turbid, mahogany appearance with a small tan head and good lacing. Intriguing aroma, with dark fruits (figs, plums), toffee, licorice, and molasses. Complex, malty, vinous taste with layers of ripe fruit, oak, vanilla, molasses, bittersweet chocolate and seasonal spices. Modestly hopped, with a full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel. Finish lingered, but wished it could have lasted longer. Just to add to all of the superlatives lavished upon this brew, here were some of the most remarkable flavors that could be associated with the word ""beer""."

2295,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.2,"Big hip-bump to ficklenicholas for this bottle, which arrived recently with 11 friends in the best BIF box I’ve received in a long & distinguished career. A long time want, 22 oz. 2016 bottle split with my wife.  The pour is Parabola black – the coffee beans do not seem to have lightened the brew into a blond barleywine or anything. My wife reports she can smell the coffee from several feet away; the rest of the smell is wild & I hope foreshadows how my tongue will be feeling shortly. Huge coffee, chocolate, vanilla, with the barrel a late, light entry.  I can’t imagine how coffee-forward Parabajava must have been 18 months ago. Even now it’s a java blast to the mouth-skin, but it’s of the smoother variety: less roast, smoothness, integrated tightly into the bourbon barrel, sanding all the rough edges off of both. Bourbon is a long, slow burn mid-palate. Vanilla, slightly scorched wood, soft chocolate & oh, there’s the roast! Not much, but right on the finish. Moderate body & zero alcohol, both of which seem less than likely. Drinkable. Wow. I’m sucking this like it’s coming off of nice teat.  Excellent beer, but next time I order, I’ll ask the house to hold the coffee & just bring me my Parabola black. Still. Not complaining."

2298,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.86,"32 oz growler courtesy of Matt. What a kind and generous gesture. Thank you very much, buddy. Split with steepH20 and milwaukeeclassic prior to the pre-Great Taste festivities. Pours a molten fudgey black forest cake with a fiery crimson ring atop. This beer just looks like it wants to whomp your ass. Left our tasting glasses stained and abused with an oily sheen. Apple brandy is supple on the nose. Barrel is massive and evident and takes the snap out of some of the pepper of the base. Cinnamon still rides hard along the dark chocolate and vanilla.  Dear god, this is delicious. I was not the biggest fan of Hunahpu's, but this treatment takes the beer to a whole different level. Vanilla ice cream, brandy, fresh taffy apple, fudge, cinnamon, and a beautiful clashing of peppery heat that plays tug-of-war with the barrel imparted flavors. Just a decadent, rich, delicious bomb of flavors that plunders the palate and leaves you wanting more. Mouthfeel is so smooth and slightly chewy. Carbonation helps keep it lively and saves it from becoming a meaty and sludgy. Not sure how many times I've truly wanted a 32 oz growler of 11.5% beer all to myself, but this certainly fits the bill. When steep said ""this will likely be the best beer I have all weekend"" the day before the Great Taste, well that's about all you need to know. Thank you again, Matt!"

I could run this past my nose all day!!"
2300,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.88,"Silky smooth texture. Rich flavors of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. Chili note is fairly subdued, but balances the sweetness. Fairly low carbonation, head is nonexistent. You feel the alcohol, but it doesn’t taste too boozy."

Rich, decadent flavor without anything close to abv burn or off flavors. Chocolate chocolate chips brownies, roast coffee, lots of great barrel flavor. Lives up to hype, excited to crack that second bottle in a couple years F: low carbonation, medium body could be a bit thicker my only possible knock against this brew O: lived up to expectations, with maybe the exception of the body but that’s only if I’m trying to find flaws.

Hefty sourness. Overall - Excellent fruit flavor, but the wine flavor is in equal proportion. Just about a tolerable amount of sourness."

2306,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.42,"Overwhelming smell of dark cacao, even from a distance. Chilies and coffee add accents. Just a hint of bourbon mash and maple. Bourbon and cinnamon both present on the palate up front, but the chocolate quickly makes itself known, with maple coming on mid-palate. Coffee is most obvious on the back half. In totality, it’s similar to a chocolate coated espresso bean ... just also coated in maple syrup and bourbon. Very minor vegetal notes from the chilies; no heat. Very drinkable. Extremely rich. Very, very sweet. Definitely a sipper and a dessert beer."

2309,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.71,"When I took my first and only trip to Great American Beer Fest in 2017, I didn't know a lot about The Lost Abbey - I'd heard a few things about Veritas, and I'd tried a select few of their beers. I was a fan, but I didn't pursue their beer to the degree that I do now. I knew that Duck Duck Gooze was on the top 250 on Beer Advocate - but I never expected that I'd be able to try it. Well now. I recently made a Facebook friend who used to live in San Diego but now lives and brews in northern Minnesota. Happy coincidence! He happens to love sours, just like I do... he helped me out with a bottle of Duck Duck Gooze (among other things) in our very first trade. I was thrilled, and still am - the beer is fantastic! It's interesting to me how DDG differs from Belgian gueuze though - the characteristic funk seems to be entirely absent, and the nose doesn't pop to quite the same degree. It smells very nice, but it's a different sort of aroma - and taste. There's a bit of cheese to the taste, and a very light, clean, crisp sort of sour and tart character. Again, the Belgian funk is missing. Perhaps this has been lost with time, but it surprises me as older Belgian lambic still seems to retain that funk. There's also a marked lack of suspension - there's no noteworthy presence of fruit, yeast, or foreign matter of any kind. I don't mind that! I know some really enjoy that in Belgian lambic, but it's a happy absence as far as I'm concerned. I'd have to say that DDG characterizes all of the things that I love about gueuze, while it also happens to have bypassed the aspects that I am not such a big fan of. It's a terrific beer, and really demonstrates why Lost Abbey is such a hyped and touted brewery. I think that I will always try far harder to pick up bottles of Russian River sours, because they're just a lot more accesible - but I will never pass on the chance to try another bottle of Lost Abbey. Their sours, wilds, and lambics are tremendous, and DDG is one of their best."
2310,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.63,Extraordinary on draft earlier this year and now months later by Crowler.
2311,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.38,"This is a very good beer. A few years ago, I would have said ""Amazing."" With what we're finding at other breweries, I'd buy it if I were local, but wouldn't go out of my way."
2312,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.1,"375 mL bottle. Inky black body. Smells of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and coconut. Tastes the same. Sweet coconut, vanilla, fudgy chocolate, more sugar, tingly alcohol. Outrageously sweet but I keep wanting more. Heavy, sweet, boozy. Stupid but very tasty."
2313,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.8,"2018 vintage, 33cl bottle with a picture of a little statue cherub holding a glass in one hand and the other hand is covering his genitals. The pour is lightly fizzy, deep orange with a wisp of a white head.  Smells wonderfully like a cross between a clean-but-musty garden shed and heaps of jarred fruit, like something tended to with such intense care that it makes you warm to so much as think about it. Incredibly complex, like a living being, without anything off or too intense. Seriously one of the very best beer aromas I've come across in my 16+ years of reviewing beer. The flavor is wonderful but not quite at the level of the aroma. Very dry and earthy yeast and bacteria start things off, not tart in the least but with the same kind of quenching bitterness I associate with the finish of a very sour candy. This dominates the first sip, but after my pallet adjusts I detect excellent fruit complexities near the middle, smoothed out wonderfully by woody tannins, finishing on the aforementioned deep dryness of ash and microbes."
2314,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.5,"Clear orange pour. Nose full of citrus including lemons and oranges. Mouthfeel is not overpowering, with a decent citrus aftertaste. Overall very strong lambic beer."
2315,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.47,"2019 b2. Thick, heavy pour. Negligible head and carbonation. Blast of Umami on the nose and when drinking. Very sweet, and not as much coconut as I’d like but that’s being picky."
2316,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.27,"Lots of chocolate malt & fudge, coffee / espresso is there but maybe just a little lacking, some slight smoky tobacco flavor on the back end adds a nice depth"
2317,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.77,"Tasted from bottle. Pours jet black with dark brown head. Huge chocolate aroma with molasses and some bourbon notes. Sticky thick chewy mouthfeel. Flavors of cocoa, caramel, molasses, toffee, bourbon, vanilla. Bourbon flavor is more subtle that a lot of BA beers. Very well done. Excellent sipper."
2318,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.22,"Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering half of the top. The aroma is of peach and a touch of brettanomyces. I’m tasting peach and just a touch of brettanomyces. The mouth is moderately carbonated, dry, and crisp."
2319,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.54,"Subtle coconut sets this off for me. Not a huge fan of it. Chocolate, bourbon, brown sugar and toasted coconut with hints of tobacco, smoke, leather and char. Very enjoyable but enjoyed regular B-Bomb a bit more. Adding this or coffee cinnamon masks the complexities of the base blend."
2320,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.33,"Muddy dark brown with a tan, very tall airy foam head that slowly condenses to a thick sponge before settling to a very pleasantly sturdy soft blanket. Toasted wheat and clove present up front, and even a bit of peppery spice comes out on the swallow. Touches of plum and date then accent the medium-light body, as its substantial froth collapses on the palate into a slick and easy semi-dry swallow pricked up by a bit of heat. An additional development of baked apple with hints of cinnamon and licorice crops up as it warms. This is definitely the most phenolic of the Westys, which makes sense for the style, for which this is a standard setter."
2321,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.75,12 oz bottle cellared at 53F poured into a tulip snifter. 2020 Vintage
2322,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.32,"after a stellar line up of beers....this was the last of em. kbbs, mornin delight, bg&e, ground state now this.... no viscosity to it when u pour (oil look lack)l, thin look finger head dissipated quick, toasty mild sweet char taste and coffee, medium feel.....she’s good though... I’d bang again"
2323,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.42,"2014 vintage; drank 2/4/17 @ Golgi Apparatus.  Black/brown appearance.  Minimal dark khaki head; no lace.  Coconut, fudge, marshmallow & faint bourbon notes in the nose.  Thick, smooth mouthfeel.  Marshmallow, dark chocolate, coconut & burnt caramel flavors up front; faint bourbon heat notes on the finish.  Rich, delicious dessert heaven."
2324,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.79,"Hazy, golden, minimal head, just looks gorgeous in a glass. Funk, acidity, nectarine, oak come through on the nose and the palate. Perfectly balanced and carbed, and perhaps a little more sour than average for SP."
2325,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.59,"look: brown/amber color, very muddy smell: brown sugar, cherry, raisin taste: sugar candy, banana, date, malt, vanilla, cherry, some unknown spices,  feel: hot, airy overall: very nice beer, somewhat strong, I quite like it, cheers"
2326,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.48,Love this brew. Looks fantastic with awesome lacing. Smells and tastes of citrus and melon. Really impressed by this old school favorite. Will grab it whenever I run across.
2327,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.32,"03/2015 - Another effing tasty beer from Side Project; lemon, funk, some barnyard, yeast aromas; effervescent, champagne, sweet, tart flavors on the palate; clean, crushable finish."
2328,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.57,"Have had b1 and b2 and consensus for both: absolutely amazing aroma and adjunct presence ...but extremely sweet, a bit insubstantial both in mouthfeel and barrel presence. A whale worth tasting but with room for improvement."
2329,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.59,"Big thanks to rudzud decent but smaller foamy creamy thick 1/2 finger head fades slowly, nice lacing, long legs, pitch black color Nose loads of dark malt, roasted malt, charred black malt and some cocoa, dark chocolate cocoa, fair coconut, a little bourbon barrel notes, oaky, thick fudgey cocoa and a little alcohol,  Taste super dark malt, dark chocolate, plenty of coconut, plenty of dark chocolate cocoa, biscuity cocoa, loads of coconut and even coconut chunks floating in the bottle somehow, and somehow it didn't go rancid, a little char, fair bitterness from roast and a bit of earthy hop, some dark chocolate fudge, great coconut lingering, sticky finish, a little dry and a bit of alcohol warmth Mouth is med to heavier bod, thick a bit fudgey, a touch of alcohol, decent carb Overall very nice, great cocoa, great coconut, a bit too much alcohol and chunks of coconut were both fun and scary"
2330,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.75,"2020 version poured from a 16oz can into a beer can shaped glass 8 days after it was canned. For me, this beer is deserving of the accolades. Murky haze, citrus. Soft."
2331,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.74,"2013 bottle poured in a DDG teku. Semi hazy golden color. Smells of funk, subtle vinegar. Taste is amazing...insanely balanced. Perfect tartness....super drinkable. Excellent carb. Overall an outstanding beer that lived up to the hype for me."
2332,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,3.77,"Surprised by the haze, it's a nearly fully opaque orange-amber with a lighter gold around the bottom edge, topped with a large khaki foam that slowly settles to a thin film with a bubbly clinging collar. Smell actually starts garlicky and biscuity, with some sharp yeast, orange zest and rind, lemon and pine. Taste is tangy and almost spicy with a mix of allium and citrus, backed by a sting of pine and a biscuity rug with a Triple Sec finish. This is definitely more old school, malty, bitter and pungent than the new haze class, but is also very citrusy and enjoyable. Body is moderately light with a bubbly light carbonation and a dry, prickly swallow."
2333,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.21,"I really wanted to love this beer. The can design is awesome. The pour is a nice amber/staw color, the smell is great. The beer is just a hair too bitter for me. I think this would have been one I loved 5-6 years ago but my taste has changed a bit with all of the the unfiltered NEIPAs that are a little more balanced. This is a quality beer that I enjoyed, but not my favorite."
2334,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.49,"500 ml bottle Pours deep cherry red, a little cloudy. White lacing for a head. Aroma is of mild cereal malts and hints of citrus over a tart cherry. Flavor is of citrus, white grape, cracker and fresh tart and sweet cherry. Light body, tingly carbonation on the tongue. Great flavor and beautiful looking beer. Very pleasant to drink. Definitely worth trying, an exceptional cherry sour."
2335,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.75,One of the best beers of the year. This balances out perfectly the cinnamon and peppercorns with the barrel and the stout. A really really special beer that I’m very glad to have tried and have more of
2336,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.57,"A slick black color with a frothy brown head. These guys seem to make some of the most strongly smelling dark beers that I have ever had. Big notes of coffee, chocolate, and spices. The drinking starts smooth and silky upfront with tons of lush chocolate malts. A smooth flow that finishes ever so slightly bitter. The coffee falls on the subtle side but the highlight flavor is clearly the coconut. I love coconut and the flavor comes off spot on genuine. Additional notes of tannin, smoke, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, cocoa powder, and smoke. The mouth feel is superb- full bodied with such a lush and silky feel. Not overly sweet and not terribly sticky but enough to still allow the flavors to linger nicely after each sip. A slight alcohol burn on the finish but otherwise the abv hides very well and it's really warming me up.  Overall, just crazy good stuff."
2337,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.0,"Sampled at de Grade for 6th Anniversary. End of bottle pour.. Pale golde, light, effervescent. Aroma and taste offer notes of Apples, grapes, funk. Plenty of pucker left in this."
2338,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.35,"Pours a thick, oily pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. The beer downright sticks to the glass as you swirl it, leaving a short-lived film of dark beer and white lace. Smell is somewwhat subdued, pretty underwheming compared to the taste. Cinnamon is most noticeable, with a sort of odd earthy, musty, woody aroma being pretty dominant as well. Perhaps a hint of coconut there. Taste is quite complex, lots of chocolate and rum noticeable at first, with a decent bit of cinnamon and vanilla coming through as well. The chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms. Quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way. Quite a bit of warm boozyness there as well, but very smooth and mellow at the same time. Mouthfeel really is fantastic, very thick, sticky, almost oily and very smooth. I was considering waiting for CBS for my 100th review, but I think this one will do nicely. The barrel-aging really did wonders to the quite overrated Hunapuh here, adding a certain complexity from the brandy and rum notes along with making the chili stand out more and generally mellowing out the beer, creating a richer harmony. Still smells really weird though."
2339,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.35,"Brown thick body with a one finger head that stays most of the way, Smells of alcohol, dried dark fruits, yeast,malts. Taste is complex very fruity, raisins, dates, port, caramel, treacle. Medium body and highly drinkable for the big abv, smooth in the mouthfeel, lasting boozy bitterness and fruity tastes remain but booze is not overpowering just warming. I was surprised I got through all 4 of my bottles as quickly as I did, without much of a struggle and was sad when they were all gone as I'm not likely to pay £70 for a box of 4 again anytime soon. It's a great beer for sure but I can't give it more because it's not really my thing but glad I got to drink this legendary beer."
2340,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.31,"different label than the one pictured here, the double label, looks nice, lighter pink than expected and lighter in color than hommage, 2018 vintage. short head, nice clarity, and a ton of fruit in the nose. i think the cherry in the hommage adds more than it immediately gets credit for, as this seems in some ways one dimensional, not a critique necessarily, as its really pure and ripe and beautiful raspberry, but there is less complexity there. the fermentation profile is awesome, a little younger lambic base, but its perfect with the fruit, its cool to still be able to taste and appreciate the grain in this, lots of oak, rose wine and flowers, lemons and minerals, i think it tastes slightly less dramatic than it smells. a little sulfur and then the fruit, red wine, and lots of oak, mature but cleaner than some of their others i have had, maybe because its so new, but its tidy and fast to finish, even with all the raspberries. their base lambic always stands out to me as one of the best, and the fruit really works well here. id like to try this a little more bottle aged, but i sure did enjoy this one. nice with chocolate and cakey dessert..."
2341,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.32,"Dull ruby body, hazy, head like himalyan salt forms well, but with low retention."
2342,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.87,L: Red wine colors drink.
2343,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.1,"This is a strange one for the Raul man. Like, it’s a bit enigmatic like eating mushrooms with David Lynch. It pours a beautiful haze like Jimmy Hendrix shredding on his ax, and it has a very pleasant aroma too. Taste is good upfront, but then it kind of slaps me on the ass like my baby mama does to me when I come home too late from da club. Other than that lil sharp weirdness in the end, I feel it like a bikram yoga sesh with Alessandra Ambrosio. See ya!"
2344,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.59,"Had on tap. Pours cloudy bright gold color with one finger white head with ample lacing.  Modest aroma of citrus and pine. Very clean smelling.  Hop forward with pine and lemon notes. Super smooth with the lemon kicking in late alomg with a lingrring light sweetness.  Soft feel with a moderate to high bitterness. Well balanced, clean and just the right flavor. This is a testament to the high quality coming from these guus"
2345,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"Had at a bottleshare. Wish I knew who brought it, so I could thank them. It was a standout among greats. Thick, rich, black blood of the Earth. Thanks whoever!"
2346,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.54,"16, 17. Big barrel presence. Chocolate, fudge, bourbon, vanilla. Biggest knock on this beer is the mouthfeel. It's just not on the same level as the rest of the experience. However, the flavors and barrel quality are fantastic."
2347,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.42,"2017 12oz bottle poured cold to a tulip glass. Dark mahogany brown with a two-finger bubbly mocha head. Lots of lacing that clings and doesn’t move, at all. Nose is faint vanilla and char, very subdued compared to what I thought it would be. First sips are woody, creamy stout, with a slight bourbon back-end linger. Very balanced flavor profile, with only a slight woody bite in the front. It’s almost like drinking “black.” Yeah, that sounds trippy, but it’s almost like not drinking anything other than a concept. It’s full, creamy, warming, filling. No alcohol presence, but it is warming. Very smooth, very easy to drink. I’m half-way through it, and am sad that it’s almost gone, with only one more on the shelf."
2348,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.41,Can: Poured a hazy blonde color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh citrusy notes with nice floral hoppy undertones and light subtle residual sugar notes. Taste is also a mix of huge juicy citrusy hoppy notes with some floral undertones and some residual sugar notes. Body is full with good carbonation. Solid IIPA with nice juicy notes.
2349,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.75,"04/2014 - Oooh, that Citra mustiness, plus citrus, hops up front; chewy, flavorful mouthfeel, clean too; so fucking good and by far my favorite solo Citra hopped beer out there!"
2350,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.93,L: Outrageously thick oily pour with a thin rust-colored head
2351,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,5.0,"Bottled 10/5/17 This gives a viscous pour. Thick and heavy from the bottle, with a heady cap of cocoa colored foam. Wonderfully complex nose. I get a light roast, cocoa nibs, a hint of vanilla and just a faint touch of boozy heat. Incredibly smooth. Creeps up on you. An amazing beer.  2019: at two years of age and the beer remains incredible. So drinkable, with just the slightest hint of heat. That ABV creeps up, but I’m not complaining—this is it for the entire evening."
2352,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.45,"Some burnt sugar and a bit of licorice. Nice dark fruits, too. Flavor has plenty of sugar and malt sweetness. Lots of caramel, toffee, and maple syrup. Nice bourbon and vanilla, too. Good dark fruit character, cocoa powder, and decent coffee. Good stuff."
2353,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.23,"Foggy amber-orange with a fuzzy off-white head settling to a thin white film and bubbling surface with a fuzzy bumpy ring. Smoothly tart green apple, lemon and grapefruit pair with a light sweetness from the red wine barrel, which also contributes a distinct red grape flavor. The medium body is a little silky and lightly crisp, easily continuing to develop a mild but splintery neutral oak that brings out accents of apricot and toasted sesame before a lightly stinging semi-dry finish. This would be killer with a ton of apricot in it, as DDG really reminds me of Fou, or at least what its base might be."
2354,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.04,"On-tap at Mekong, tulip.  Black like black licorice with a ring of real tan that leaves discrete streaks of lace.  Strong roast, vanilla, sticky bun, refined espresso.  This thing is intense. Charcoal, black licorice, sweetened espresso. The flavors reverberate on my tongue.  Thick, sticky, soft carbonation.  I honestly don’t find it exceptionally complex, but it is intense on a level I’ve rarely experienced."
2355,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.6,"Strong oak and barrel flavors out of the gate. As the beer warms, the flavors transition to sweet molasses and bitter chocolate, wrapped in sharp tannins from the barrels. Thick mouthfeel and a sweet dessert finish. Not much of a difference between 2017 and 2018."
2356,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.58,"Enjoyed from bottle at Brasserie Cantillon. Modestly hazy and apricot-colored, with as much head on it as you care to produce when pouring. Bursting with fruit, moderate tartness and a touch of sour funk. Easy to see why this can be rated as the best Belgian fruit lambic around."
2357,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,2.35,"2014 review.... it’s boozy, but I’m no way does this compare to today’s barrel aged beers or flavored barrel aged stouts, this is crap...... boozy and messy. Low grade fuel and GTFOH with stupid old money v new money comments"
2358,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.37,Very pretty looking. Pitch brown in all the right ways. Love the little lacing patches that linger after each drink. Lots of cinnamon on the nose to go with dark almost leathery chocolate. Mexican heat heat too - brightens up the same notes from the nose and adds some notes of chiles.
2359,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,3.83,"Black with tan lace. Harsh malt smell. Something about BL stouts that doesn't work for me. Coffee has bite and doesn't skew toward frapacino; some smoke, more coffee cake. Iron, maybe cough syrup on the end. Not especially dense. Good, though. Not unusually dense."
2360,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.55,"Society & Solitude #4 pours a thick, hazy and golden pear juice looking yellow with a big 2-finger, white and complex head, with excellent retention and lacing. The smell is juicy with a big, clean and bright citrus presence, like a tall glass of orange juice and tangerine with a hint of mango and a mild candied sweetness. The taste is excellent! Nice and smooth over the palette with a balanced citrus flavor with a mild creaminess but not overly thick. Juicy orange up front with some berry, a sweet candied melon and a grassy yet subtle dank characteristic."
2361,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.25,"2016 vintage (released 3/12/16); drank 5/21/16 @ Yuss Haus Mach II.  Black appearance.  A violent pour yielded a big, noisy dark khaki head; nice lace.  Orange citrus & milk chocolate notes in the nose; Black IPA vibes!!  Thick, sticky mouthfeel.  Orange citrus & rich milk chocolate flavors up front; cinnamon notes on the finish. Booze heat notes emerged as this warmed.  Unique, complex & tasty. Nice!"

2363,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.75,"Okay, got this the first time from a BIF and @JayORear and while I thoroughly enjoyed that, I didn't have the experience to rate it. So while in Colorado last week visiting family, imagine my surprise to see this on the shelves. I live in Michigan and we never see this! "
2364,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.8,"Yup. This is where it's at. I had this on draft at Tree House in March, 2020. I had tried Double Shot w/ Vanilla Bean before and absolutely loved it. This had what you'd expect from the name - just a bit more coffee flavor than Double Shot, but still without being overpowering or too bitter. One of the smoothest stouts I've ever had, and popping with flavor in even the smallest sip. Delicious creamy mouthfeel, and you didn't notice the 9% ABV until after the beer was gone. I actually bought a second draft, Alter Ego w/ Peach, and double-fisted them back and forth. They actually worked great together, like fruit and chocolate for dessert."
2365,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.81,Format: 4 oz pour from Toppling Goliath taproom.
2366,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.71,"L:. Pours a bubbly brilliant clear straw gold, the head lingers for a while and dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing. S: The dry yeasty funk hits the nose first and is very inviting, followed by notes of peach and light citrus fruit, followed by a nice nutty bread in the end. T:. Yeasty, funky and dry, peachy and white wine grape, with notes of pear, a dry bitterness. Everything is very harmonious and creates an amazing beer. F:. Light body, and very easy drinking. O:. This beer is definitely world class"
2367,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,3.91,"This was a funky one. L: Amber with a soft white head that didn't stick around too long. Not much lacing on the glass.  S: Pretty good preview of the taste. Lots of funk with a mix of cherry, red wine, oak, and floral elements. T: Middle of the road tartness with a lot of sour cherries. There was definitely a strong red wine backbone with some oak flavors too. Mostly sour cherries, which is not my personal favorite. Wasn't overpowering like some sour cherry beers I've had, but definitely dominated the flavor. F: Thinner mouthfeel. Pretty dry and decently carbonated.  O: Cherry beers aren't my favorite, but this was the best I'd had. I felt the beer was better when it was colder, and as the beer warmed it became a little drier and more of the red wine and oak flavors came out. I think this gave the beer a pretty complex flavor, but sour cherries with red wine was a little much for me. Felt more sour as it warmed."
2368,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.19,"L -- Pours a thick, viscous black in the glass with just a scant off-brown head produced with moderately aerated pour. The guy filling my growler apologized to me because the beer is so thick that it takes quite a while to pour out of the tap"
2369,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.25,"Received in a trade, shared with JLindros. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice clear light honey golden hue with a thin head that fades to leave light wisps. S - Aromas of typical funky flora type saison. Light wine notes, fair amount of mineral notes, not much plum. T - Taste is similar to the nose, good wine notes with pleasant saison yeast. Little bit of barrel, the wine is really pleasant however there is very little plum. M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, crisp, clean. O - Overall this was a very solid farmhouse, however, the plum notes were too subtle for my tastes. Serving type: bottle"
2370,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.39,"Ive been seeking this title for quite some time. Im a little disappointed. Not that it isnt good...its very good. But it doesnt stand out to me amongst OH's other titles. Its essentially equally as good. Its a great beer, but I didnt need to track the specific title down."
2371,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.46,"2018 batch poured at cellar temp.  Nose is strong apricot, minimal funk. Taste follows, strong apricot, minimal funk, strong acidity on the end. Feel is effervescent, medium carb. Overall, it is a great apricot beer! 2020 batch "
2372,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.23,"Much thanks to John for sending me on my way with this in tow. I can't find any date info on the bottle itself, but I want to say he told me it was a 2016? I could well be making that up, but that's the year that sticks in my mind for whatever reason. It's somewhere between batch 5 and 15 as best as I can sleuth up. Yeah, narrows it down a lot... An aggressive pour gives me a golden yellow bauble that still has some opacity to it. A nice finger of white fuzzy head is dissipating in front of my eyes, but leaves at least some residual to appreciate.  Nose is sweet with belgian yeasts, fairly peppery, and some faint lemon and green apple. Has that character to it that tickles the back of my throat when sniffing around.  Flavour is a nice melange of lemon and pepper (but less than the nose suggested) and green apple and like undertones of marzipan, with some of the belgian sweetness towards the end, but not too much. Mildly grassy/floral and a surprisingly bitter/dry finish."
2373,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.34,"32oz growler poured into a snifter Pours deep black in color with a creamy khaki head that has decent retention. Smells of raspberry laced fudge, dark chocolate, caramel & vanilla. Taste follows the aroma, but the raspberry isn't as strong. It manages to pop through notes of dark chocolate with some jam-like notes. The finish brings out a hint of peppery rye and oak. Medium-heavy body with moderate carbonation, creamy mouthfeel and finish."

2375,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.56,"I have wanted to one of these for the longest time. Knew there was a winter storm coming and picked up a six. Just spent 3 hours shoveling 18 inches of snow. Deep coffee brown on the pour with a beige head and thick lace. Aroma is heavenly -- rich coffee, roasted oats, malts and chocolate. Taste follows the aroma and each sip presents sweet and malty bitter notes. Feel is creamy and full-bodied. ABV is 8.3% but doesn't come on strong. This is one is 'world-class' and more than lives up to its reputation."
2376,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.12,"Picked up some cans at the brewery at the end of August. This is a tasty vermont IPA, hazy but not gritty. Excellent mouthfeel for the style. Great tropical aromas and flavors but this came in just a touch behind Double Galaxy for me. Good beer no doubt."
2377,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.31,2020 vintage 16oz tall boy. 
2378,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.56,"16oz can dated 8/10/18. Pours murky gold with minimal retention or lacing. Hop and citrus tonic in the nose. Pithy grapefruit, orange, peach, and pine. Medium bodied with a slickish, oily mouthfeel. A carpet-bombing of hops on the palate. Raw hop resins with a bitter booziness. Grapefruit and candied pine. Finishes with a fairly strong throat burn and alcohol-infused hop concentrate. What a bruiser. Old scool Trillium at its best."
2379,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.44,"b1. Slight gusher, but it just flooded the immediate area with floral and citrus aromas. A closer whiff reveals the typical SP rustic characteristics, though this seems to be much fruitier than some of their other offerings (at least the few I've had). It's almost like sticking your head inside of a used wine barrel. "
2380,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.5,"Bottle poured into snifter. Chocolate and bourbon greet nose. Bourbon on front, vanilla and chocolate on back. For a HG BEER this is smooth. 2017 bottle 6/14/17"
2381,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.11,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter glass. Thanks Ryan for sharing this one.  Pours a medium-dark brown body, translucent on the pour but black in the glass. Small brown ring of foam.  On the nose is roasty malts, dark fruits, figs, whiskey and light chocolate. Not a super potent aroma.  On the tongue, it’s pretty whiskey-forward but a little thin with chocolate/light coffee flavors, dark fruits on the follow through and a very roasty aftertaste which I enjoyed. Mouthfeel is lighter for an imperial stout. Medium carbonation. Overall enjoyable to drink but was maybe expecting a little more, especially in the mouthfeel department."
2382,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.53,"I had no idea when I traded for this how highly rated it was on here. Sure, it's an American Imperial Stout with all the booze and heft that one would expect, but this was so tasty and wonderful that I didn't even notice how strong it was until I looked at the label. Yeah, this was a beast *but* it wasn't just because of the booze as this had enough behind it to back up it's overt heft. Of course, I thought that was a wonderful thing! Of course, this had a dark brown pour to it with a thin, mocha head that didn't last long. The lacing left behind was thin and scattered as much of the soapy bubbles slid down the side of my pint glass after every sip. Tons of maple syrup, molasses, and rich coffee in the slightly muted nose but Good Lord, everything was amplified a few notches once I took a sip of this. Really, really impressed with how this felt as the thickness, sugary sweetness, and roasted notes came through in the taste. Lip-smackingly wonderful as even my hand smelled like fresh maple syrup once I put my glass down. If my breakfast at IHOP could be fermented and made to last for the duration, this would be the end result as I could almost taste the syrups that I pour on my pancakes, as I worked my way through this. Sure, this was strong and it felt every bit of the 11% ABV that it was from the first sip down to the last one. When you have a beer that feels like pancake batter, berry compote, and fresh roasted joe all rolled into one, you don't forget it soon and that was the case with this offering from Great Notion. Slightly roasted, reminiscent of sarsaparilla, and slick like something fresh brewed, this beer was truly one of a kind. Dated11/26/18 near the top of the can with ""DRINK NOW"" above that, I let this go for a bit but it held up well over the last year and change. Easily worth it's accolades and ratings on here, I loved this beer and am so glad that I was able to get a can of it to review!"
2383,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.61,"Pours a hazy yellow color with a hint of orange, perhaps the most tepid one of the bunch of amazing Treehouse beers I’ve been enjoying. A moderate foam head very frothy quickly dissipates thick rings of lace In the nose, a medley of juicy hops aromas of tropical, citrus and stone fruit. This is accompanied by dank and pungent herbal hops; a real pleasure on the nose. There are notes of mango, pineapple, banana, passion fruit, grapefruit and orange pith, lemon, peach and apricot. A subtle honeyed malt aroma hints at the malt backbone, while resiny notes of pine and grass comprise a highly aromatic and herbaceous blend.  The taste opens with lip smacking juicy sweetness, supported by soft and creamy honeyed and doughy malts, wheat and oats. Medium full bodied with its ultra soft and viscous mouthfeel, this beer almost ventures into the “milkshake/smoothie” territory. Yet, a balanced complexity of flavors, including a developing bitterness and resiny and dank flavors soon help transform this into a supremely pleasurable drinking experience. Tropical notes of mango juice, passion fruit and banana are balanced by the pithy zest of citrus fruit. There are also notes of peach, apricot and nectarine. Furthermore, the developing herbal hops spices add a pleasant prickle. This includes notes of pine resin, grass and peppery spices. The carbonation is gentle and the alcohol is well masked. The mouth coating feel is well balanced by a crisp, spicy and dry finish.  A real treat to drink this for its complexity of flavors. It is also a dynamic brew that opens sweet, smooth and juicy, while evolving into a highly drinkable assortment of zesty and spicy hops flavors. I just finished my last can and I’m quite sad to see it go."
2384,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.43,"Canned on 2/3/2021 so reviewed at 2 weeks. Poured into a snulip glass. It pours. a murky, dirty tangerine color with a half finger of creamy, milk-white head and thick soapy lacing. A bright, fruity nose featuring lemon, lime, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and soft floral hops. The taste is huge and fruity. It opens with tart lemon peel and grapefruit rind that is quickly matched by sweet notes of pineapple, peach, mango, and lychee. You won't find a better showcase of Citra hops. They provide lots of fruit up front and clean bitterness at the finish. This ale has a plush, pillowy mouth feel with pleasant carbonation, and a punchy 8.5% ABV that gives it substance without overpowering. Overall, this is an exquisite New England DIPA that merits its lofty rating."

2386,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.81,"The nose of this showcases the sherry aged gueuze and the familiar drie funk. On the palate more of the same that funky cheesey gueuze goodness, grassy notes and tons of dark fruit and residual sugar from the sherry to finsh."
2387,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.88,"One of the best Black Tuesday bottles I have ever had. Drank this along side a 2009 Black Tuesday and, while the '09 was a clear winner, the Reserve held it's own very well. Excellent barrel character and flavor with absolutely no heat. Everything you would want out of this beer after reading the description"
2388,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.94,"Amazing beer. Cantillon always knocks it out of the park. Lambics are great in general, but theirs are the best. More easy drinking than some Lambics. Love it."
2389,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.41,"Just gorgeous to look at - I almost didn't want to drink it. Like Miami Madness, it has a crazy low abv, so you can sip it all day long by the pool. DFPF >MM btw."
2390,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.68,"For purposes of this review, 2013 was compared side-by-side to 2016. Appearance- The beer was a bright straw yellow with a bright white head. Smell - The sour meshes with the oak. Taste - This gueuze is so well balanced and far from acidic. It is smooth and oaky with plenty of green apple. 2016 is thinner and not a sour as 2013. To a degree the 2016 seems a bit watery. 2016 even lingers during the 2013 sampling. This is a green apple bonanza. The sour oakinessthis linger so well. Mouthfeel- I am a little amazed at how well balanced this is. It is sour, but not burning acidic. Overall- This gueuze is out of this world."
2391,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.26,"650ml bottle into a goblet. 2016 vintage, #003. Dark reddish brown body, clear when held up to the light. Small off white head quickly dissipates, no lacing. Aroma of Belgian candy. On tasting, well, it's simply delicious. A sweet candy and molasses flavor, but not cloying. Abv very apparent, but not one note of harshness. Silky smooth. There is even a faint pepper touch now and then. Loving this.  Mouth close to full, finish a warming sweetness with even a feather light bitter touch right at the end.  Overall, really enjoyed this long slow sipper on a wet & cold new year's day."
2392,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.6,"A: Decanted orange pour with red, and bottom gold highlights. The collar is softly white in practice, and rounds to ½ an inch before dissipating to a dynamic lace S: Aroma is encapsulated thru sherry wet cobblestones, dungeon cobwebs, and a musty oak chest. Progression is ongoing amid fruited cherries, cellar peach, apricot kernels, and pear skins with backed wooded tea leaves. The integration is in sync, with balanced acidity on more green skins to an indirect Melon presence on growth T: Proficient harmonization on palate, where notes are fully characterized with lean minerality. The lemon peel, citrus rind, and apricot crisp continue on the basement webbing alongside a catacomb of grape funk - subtle notes of white peppered pistachio skins, sesame seeds, cored peaches and sharp, cardamom spiced nectarines come out in length M: Carbonation is soft and sensible to the earthy bright feel in crushed rocks and dry fruit O: Spirited integration, where barrel is patient and kind to the surroundings: offering development/evolution to a steadfast brew"
2393,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.61,"Alan, thank you so much for this one.  2019 vintage - 375ml bottle - poured into a Zinfandel stem at 45°F. With a loud, forceful *POP* of the cap, Juicy pours a slightly foggy deep burnish orange-amber hue - rather dark, forming just a razor-thin collar with some slow lazy rising bubbles. Nose: My goodness, this is striking. This is a mandarin orange - freshly peeled and squeezed until the juice begins to run. Not naval, not Cara Cara, not mineola - mandarin - joined by gooseberry, white grape, Meyer lemon, apricot, gingerbeer, green apple, cloudberry jam, all swirling amidst some subtle barnyard funk, wet hay, petrichor, cellar stone, wet leaves, wine-soaked oak, old books, some zesty acidity, and these immensely complex perfume notes. This may be the single most impressive aroma I've encountered. My first ever 5 on anything. I don't hand those out... Palate: Juicy greets the palate with that soft, restrained Hill Farmstead tartness - citrusy - with a noticeable malt sweetness behind it. There's almost some IPA influence, with juicy flavours of grapefruit, pineapple, fresh grass, gooseberry, white grape, and some serious sauvignon blanc influence. Mid-way, the subtle acidity fades, revealing some grainy malt, and a musty, overripe dankness emerges. The brighter fruity notes begin to give in to some grassy character, orange pith, lime leaf, and some bitter peach pit. Some resinous Nelson hop character emerges, still bacled by some lemon zest, and then vinous wine cask, tannic grape skin, and lightly bitter hop resinous waft through the finish. Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-bodied, with a touch of weight to it, despite its small size. Effervescence is ultra-fine - on par with champagne, but much, much softer. Some dry tartness up front, fading to semi-dry with grain poking through, and then finishing mostly dry, with some tannins and resinous hop oil cling. Overall: This is a truly spectacular example of what creativity, nuance, and new boundaries can achieve. This farmhouse ale displays a rare quality of not really having an equal - as in, nothing really compares to it. It's a saison, but it has some pale ale spirit, but it Nelson-hopped, with theae heady, exotic elements that pair seamlessly and beautifully with the wine barrel, and everything about it is so perfectly rounded and softened, like a river rock smoothed by the waters of time. One of those rare, inspiring bottles that just sings in harmony."
2394,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.91,"Nose is of huge coconut, chocolate, vanilla and walnuts. Taste is just as good, big time coconut and chocolate, followed by coffee and a slight nut flavor, like almonds or hazelnuts. Beer goes down smoothly but the mouth feel is just right, not thin but not too thick, an excellent balance!  An absolutely exquisite beer, kudos to the fine folks at WeldWerks for crafting such a masterpiece."
2395,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.67,"The beer, poured into a wine glass developed a quick settling head atop it's murky copper hue. The aroma was what I had been craving. I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate. This was simply exquisite."
2396,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.63,"Double Dry Hopped Congress Street pours a milky, dull orange with a nice finger and a half of thick, off white head. The smell is sweet with pineapple, grapefruit and mango with a hint of earthy pine and wet grass. The mouthfeel is thick with orange and grapefruit over the palette with a candied tropical fruit and a slight pine bitterness. Excellent beer!"
2397,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.38,"Corked and caged bottle poured into a snifter Dark brown liquid, two finger brown foam cap , dense rich bubbles that form larger bubbles as the pour recedes, good lacings , good rentention, settles to a dense foam layer Aroma of anise, bourbon, tobacco, milk chocolate, char, roasted malts Taste is bourbon, char, roast malts, bitter chocolate,  A mild char bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue , low sudsing, good body Good beer"
2398,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.57,"Classic hazy, opaque, and nearly pulpy New England look; mango-orange body. Strong head production, with about a finger and a half of off-white foam from a gentle pour. Retention is solid. Aroma is just bursting with hops: bright herbs (mint, oregano, basil), waves of citrus (mandarin orange, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit), tropical fruit (melon, mango, strawberry, peach), and a honey cracker malt base beneath it all. Brew delivers the same character to the palate. There's a chewy, grainy, crackery malt bill in the background, reminding you this is an APA, while still allowing the hop character to shine. Bright, minty herbs; biting citrus; mild pine and resin; and to a lesser prominence, some juicy tropical tones. Flavor profile matches the nose in terms of individual tones. More bitter than you might expect, favoring grapefruit, lemon, and citrus peel a touch more than other fruit. Quite biting for the New England style, but very appropriate for an APA. Still quite creamy; surprisingly astringent."
2399,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.56,"LOOKS: Opaque, and a burnt orange like the rest. White foam that sticks around and leaves a thick lacing down the glass."
2400,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.6,"Look: Pitch black, like oil coming out of the bottle. A finger of very dark brown head resembling chocolate milk. Smell: Maple syrup and milk chocolate. Taste: Strong maple syrup undercut by a small amount of roast bitterness and a doughy malt aftertaste. Sweet, but not cloying. Mouthfeel: Thick and full, with decent carbonation. Overall: Like their Last Buffalo in the Park, this is absolutely decadent. It tastes more like dessert than beer."
2401,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.5,L: clearish red with no head. 
2402,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.46,"Canned on 8/7/20, consumed on 9/15/20. A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is hazy yellow-golden with a half-finger white head that settles fast. S: Really nice nose - a strong nose that jumps out of the glass. Dank, green, raw hops and a lot of tropical fruit: mango, some pineapple, papaya.  T: Follows the nose, with mango, pineapple, citrus pith and peel, and a bite of leafy green hops. White grape skins as I take a few more sips (makes me wonder if Nelson hops are in the house tonight - wait . . . I see that's not the case, must be the Mosaic and Galaxy hops instead. . . ). Alcohol is noted as heat on the back of the palate. Good balance, with a nice bite of bitterness at the end, which lingers.  M: Juicy in feel, call it medium in heft/weight. Somewhat juicy up front, but lightly dry and chalky into the aftertaste. A bit of booziness.  O: Very good. A little too much alcohol, but otherwise a very well done brew."
2403,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.74,"L - not sure how this one has eluded me for so long. Pours a thick murk. I'd say yellow, but it's a dark shade of yellow, almost brown. Oily head with a rainbow sheen. S - fruity peach, pineapple, and apricot. Herbal mango and hop esters. Tart lemon balances an incredible aroma. T - soft candied orange and tangerine. Subtly spicy with dank hop oils and vibrant passionfruit. Citrus rind a la grapefruit, orange, and lemon-lime, but almost no bitterness, just a mild tingle. Still manages to avoid total sweetness with a touch of dryness and overall herbal undertones. Gentle and balanced. F - mostly soft and fluffy with a hint of electric zest from the hop acidity. Full without being overly viscous. Low carbonation. O - one of Trillium's best. Not the juiciest or the most potent, but one of the most balanced. Soft, pithy flavors and focus on extracting as much flavor from the dry hopping as possible. Herbal without feeling like you're biting into raw hops and juicy without feeling like you're drinking Juicy Juice."
2404,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.63,"Pours bright yellow and hazy, with an appropriate amount of head. Smells like a pineapple made sweet love to a passionfruit. Tastes of gentle grapefruit bitterness right away that's balanced with the right amount of malty sweetness.  Feels like I'm going to drink 5 of these because of how smooth this body is.  Overall this is a very drinkable Imperial IPA thats heavy enough to want to take your sweet time with it, yet refreshing enough to want another sip right as you put the glass down. Yet another great brew from the wizards up in Northern VT."
2405,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.77,"L: pours thick, cloudy orange with a finger of white head that fades "
2406,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.65,"Poured into a glass suited for beer, one-half inch of foam which recedes quickly. The beer is not clear but not hazy. Smell is of orange, light pie crust and something dank. Wonderful feel in the mouth. Carbonation is very good and it is soft on the tongue and palate. I taste oranges. And there is a dankness and resiny undertone that is pleasant, ABV is hidden well. This is my favorite double IPA but I continue to have a difficult time saying why. A reviewer said it was ""gestalt' which is a fancy way of saying it all comes together well without any attribute of the beer sticking out.  I love this beer, but like many others, it is over-priced, and I wish more breweries would follow the lead of Lagunitas, which continues to churn out high-value beers at reasonable prices."
2407,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.2,"Can. Tan head. Black color.  Rich, roasted malts, coffee, caramel, cocoa powder, Hershey’s syrup, and chocolate. A lot more body and flavor than the abv would suggest. Very flavorful."
2408,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.35,"Hazy yellow with a bubbly foam on top. Some spotty lacing down the sides of the glass. Orange citrus aromas highlight a soft nose, just a touch of hoppy resin and booze detectable as well. The flavor has a lot of complexity going on with lightly fruity flavors. The can describes peach and papaya flavors, as well as orange juice and there's no arguing with that. There is also a mild hop bitterness that just takes the edge of the sweet flavors so expertly. All those flavors are nestled into a medium carbonation and full body and create a balanced and extremely pleasant experience. Incredibly enjoyable to sip on and reflect on just how expertly crafted this beer is."
2409,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.44,"Truly excited to finally get to try this legend! Poured from 16oz can into stemless tulip. Straw colored, slightly transparent haze. Slight dank bitterness with undertones of stone/tropical fruit on the nose. Taste/mouthfeel are soft on the front of the palate - goes down with just a bit of a bite of bitterness. Somewhat juicy. Overall - this one didn't disappoint! The softness/juiciness backed by the slight bitterness is the perfect marriage of east coast/west coast styles."
2410,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.03,"Thanks to Pipeworks for sending not just their delicious regular beers (Ninja v. Unicorn!), but also plenty of great seasonals. Keep sending & I’ll keep buying. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife.  The pour is a yeasty-looking, slightly clouded orange. The nose is, as stereotypical as it is, juicy tropical fruits & sweetness, though both are subdued.  Emerald Grouper is better than the soggy catfish I had for dinner…leaving fried fish to marinate in the curry wasn’t the best of decisions. The honey is stronger than most honeyed IPAs, lovely & right up front. It mingles with strong florals, white pepper spiciness, citrus, pine, mango, with a long chord of bitterness running all the way through. Heavier & stickie than your run-o-the-mill IIPA, which limits how much I’d want to consume in one sitting.  So few IPAs with honey manage to hit the sweet spot, but this one is the bee’s knees, living up to its lofty reputation. Excellent beer."
2411,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.7,"Reviewed from notes- August 2016 Pours almost clear golden color with a lively white head that reduces to leave just a ring. Smells of cheese funk, orange, overripe stone fruits, cracked pepper, dried hay, dried dark fruits. Tastes of barnyard funk with fruity notes of lemon peel and orange, the sherry barrel is noticed mid-palate, adding dried dark fruits, even a hint of a nutty element. Oak, grass, cinnamon, dried hay, cheesy funk on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Outstanding and unique"
2412,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,5.0,Incredible beer. Tasted from can. Robust aroma. Lot of orange with some peach and mango. Very well balanced. Lots of citrus and tropical fruits on flavors. Creamy mouthfeel. Excellent tasting IPA. Overall a top notch IPA even by Trilliums really high standards.
2413,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.46,"On tap at Toronado SD, left over from Beer Week, into a tulip.  Leather-mahogany in color, viscous complexion dampens any attempt at a head. "
2414,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.25,"Bottle: 2013 A: Pour is thick, and dark brown with minimal head formation, retention, and lacing S: Hazelnuts, dark figs and mixed fruits in the aroma. Quite impressive with the barrel character surfacing the roasted malts, nuts, and fruity/earthy undertones. A nice balance to the subtle foray of black licorice, toffee, molasses, smoked bourbon, vanilla, toasted coconut/marshmallows T: More of the heat takes precedence, yet not overbearing with well-incorporated notes of raisins, caramel, brown sugar, smoke, leather, molasses, oak, cocoa, hints of nuts M: Feel is roughly average, with fluctuating carbonation; more heat as it warms O: Age seemed to be a benefactor, with the elegant portrayal of notes in the aroma while not too cloying. There’s heat, but it’s not overly constraining"
2415,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.58,"Pours a hazy light orange with soft, fluffy head. Smell is juicy with notes of mango, pineapple, grass, melon and peach. Taste is juicy, hoppy and a bit grassy. Solid bitterness with notes of mango, citrus, melon and peach. Great balance. Mouthfeel is medium, soft and pillowy, well carbonated. Overall, an outstanding beer, great flavor and balance."
2416,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.99,"Poured from a growler into a taster. Absurd amounts of coconut in the nose with bourbon and chocolate filling in the rest. Taste follows the nose, perfect tasting barrel aged coconut stout."
2417,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.02,"Super vibrant orange, almost neon, with a persistent lumpy off-white foam that settles to a thick collar and thin film. Aroma has faint notes of various fruits like apple, orange and apricot, all on toast, with some funk, peppery oak and cheese that's kind of reminiscent of Gose, even with accents of seaweed and salt. I also detect some PEZ towards the tail end of a whiff. However, as it warms, the toast transitions to a breadiness that becomes completely overwhelming at the end of the session. Having just had a full bottle of Apricot Casey Family Preserves, that one tasted more fresh, herbal and orchard-like. AdF is sharper, more sour, a little less fruit expressive, but with a bit more oak. The sourness nears vinegar at times, but avoids it thankfully. It's also kind of orangey and grassy with some peach candy in the swallow. Finally, funk is more present than Casey's, albeit lightly so. The medium body has a nice froth that fades to a crisp fizz. This is super tingly and salivatingly tangy, with a semi-dry finish, but a slight burn on the way down increases the longer you go at it. Batch 3, 2018 vintage"
2418,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.05,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass, sure why not. Canned July 24th 2018. Quit a good soapy three finger bubbly head that dissolves and pops with quite a bit of gusto. Opaque dark lemon yellow to hinting orange body color, not quite full turbid character but also with a nice glow. Very nice aromatic nose. Light malts with a touch of crispy brown sugar, mixing with a very noticeable tropical hop angle of mostly pineapple. Soft possible sensing body, with an excellent sugary quality that isn't overbearing. Quite nice. Palate is very solid. Light bodied even for a pale ale, but just flirts with wetness in mouthfeel and inching to a chalk aftertaste. Base flavors are very good, a rich light almost crusty character with mixing pineapple and touches of light pine. Finishes about the same aromatically but goes almost weak mint and earth rich on the aftertaste. Very solid new age pale, staying in both ground places, but also flirts with a little baby aspirin as well. Very drinkable and still enjoyable."
2419,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.44,Type: 8-oz. draft
2420,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.78,Solodomed a 2011 vintage on Boxing Day. I love how this has mellowed out over the years. Still verry boozy but not as sweet as fresh. Way better balance i'd say and still holding up well.
2421,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.77,"Bottled Sept 14, 2018 - Found still on the shelf at a Spec's in Galveston Texas in April of 2020! Bought all they had at $16.83ea. (8) - Had shared this with running buddies in the past, and forgot just how much we liked it. Found it still in the Spec's bag, last night in the back of the closet. Poured into my Houston Beer wiezen glass, because my teku is still in the trailer (from the last camping trip) and I knew a plain ol' pint glass wouldn't do much justice. Pours dark, and not much Amber/tan head although the glass was not cold. COFFEE, was the 1st thing I noticed. Not especially thick, but definitely smooth and still worth sharing again! Now have 7 left..."
2422,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.34,"Interested and curious to try this again. Because I remember the first time having this (in 2016) noting that it muted the chili peppers and now with the 2017 and 2018 bomb! I have felt like the pepper quality has already been muted. And because it's only 11.2%? The regular is 13% and pirate bomb is 15%? What's the difference here? Let's see. Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out looking like dark chocolate in color and forms a very thin caramel crown that disippated before I even got a picture. The first thing I notice on the smell is a ton of dark fruit. Raisins and plums dance around while introducing you to some barrel notes in the form of a dry oak smell. Very good smell but I'm not getting too much from the nose in the way of the regular bomb! So we'll see what the tastes brings. From the first sip the chocolate kicks through the curtain and steals the floor, while the dark fruit are supporting from behind. As far as the chili peppers, it's about what I expected. You wouldn't even know they're in the beer. I wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well, but I do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and fudge like. It coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation. Overall, this was a very good treat and I'm glad to have another crack at it. But it's pretty much what I remember from the first time. It's very good, but not great. I've had better barrel aged beers and it does bother me that this one covers up all the flavors of the original. Kinda takes the point away to me, I guess. It's a solid treat nonetheless, but give me a regular Bomb! and I'll be good."
2423,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.46,"02/2016 - vintage 2015 - a lot of brownie, fudge, nice tobacco notes, smooth bourbon on the nose; slightly sweet, a bit creamy too, rich chocolate, bourbon on the palate; the body is to be desired, but overall it's tasty."

2425,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.92,"From a bottle picked up in Belgium. Dark brown color with a thick layer of tan head. Smells of bready malts, caramel, and dried fruit. Medium feel, fluffy and smooth. Tastes like it smells, bready malts, moderate sweetness, and dried fruits on the finish. Outstanding, one of the best I've had."
2426,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.35,"75cl bottle. Golden orange with a short-lasting white head. Smells like vinegar, macerated grapes, barnyard funk. Sour taste all the way, with interesting notes of mould, barnyard funk, apple vinegar and grape juice. Good stuff - probably the best gueuze I ever tried."
2427,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.13,"Triple Sunshine pours a murky, dark orange with a vibrant and healthy 1-finger head with spotty lacing. The smell hits with a big hop aroma including pineapple and grapefruit and a grassy note. Taste is a bit hot up front with pithy fruit and some citrus and floral notes late."
2428,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.54,Truly tasty IPA-ish pale ale. More hoppy than some IPAs I’ve had but really tasty.
2429,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.5,Wonderful coffee notes to the nose and taste. I was a bit surprised that this is not richer - the mouthful was slightly thin compared to Monster's Park we shared shortly afterwards.
2430,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.93,"I've tasted several thousand different beers over the years. 10,000 plus check ins and at least that amount of different beers on a couple of other ""check in"" sites. Bottom Line: This is my favorite beer.....ever, to date. I can't say it's the best made or even the best beer I've had - it's simply my favorite. Amazing flavors, mouthfeel and finish. It has it all with great complexities and yet goes down easy and you want more. Good by itself or amazing with just about any food profile."
2431,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.05,"Huge thanks to Alan for this one, and plenty of other long time wants. This is one of those beers you just have to try at least once, so here I go! Pint can - dated 01/14/20 - poured into a tumbler at 50°F.  Pours a gleaming jet black - no head, until a two finger coffee bean-coloured head races up, before racing right back down to a still top, looking like tar in the glass. Like nothing I've ever seen. I'll give a 5 to that.  Nose: Black coffee. Some roasty nuance, such as a hint of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and even a hint of dark fruit and red wine, but this is essentially sweet coffee. Palate: Much like the nose, this is an absolute coffee bomb. It opens up quite sweet, with lots of cocoa from the roast, which lends its own coffee character as well. Moderate roast, accentuated by the coffee, but the hearty sweetness wins over. Secondary notes of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and unfortunately, lactose. I knew there was something unpleasant about this - there's clearly lactose in it. The lactose lends this quick spike of this almost aspartame/artificial sweetener flavour just before the finish, where it also extinguishes any sort of roast that may have been. Luckily, there's enough coffee for the more roasty notes of the bean to come through in the finish, which helps to dry it out.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is full-bodied, and has a slick, oily feel to it. In addition to the naturally full body, the lactose definitely adds,some viscosity here, as does the sheer level of sweetness. Major stickiness is left clinging to the lips with this one. Effervescence is actually quite adequate - lower, but very fine and fizzy.  Overall: All the components of a great coffee stout are here. The beans themself are clearly primo quality, with zero green pepper or stale notes, the base stout is well-crafted, but - it's too sweet, and there's just too much lactose. In fact, if there weren't any lactose, i think it could pull off the sweetness just fine, but with both elements in place, it does become a bit cloying. I do not think the lactose benefits this beer in any way whatsoever. You can easily get that chewy feel without milk sugar, and it ends up tasting more natural. It's still good, it's still drinkable, but I'd either like to see this tamed by a bourbon barrel, or just lose the lactose all together."
2432,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.71,"Grassy and dank and just slightly bitter - but, complementary sweet, juicy notes make this a tremendous pleasure. Nose is complex and lightly floral, dank, sweet. Beautiful, hazy pour with nice lacing. Carbonation is just right - quite pleasant. Nelson isn't even my favorite hop, but it's so well-utilized in this beer. It amazes me that some people will sleep on Hill Farmstead now, favoring new hype breweries. HF is still killing it."
2433,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.49,"Most recent batch bottle poured into fluted snifter. Very dark, near black and mostly opaque. Not thick, but able to block light out effectively. Head is light brown and settles slowly. Aroma has hint of spice, medium roast coffee and floral sweetness. The oak is definitely noticeable with just a slight hint of the booze after warming. Flavor is bold. Lots of wood, vanilla, and the earthy bourbon flavors push forward. The coffee flavor is dark and bitter, but balances the sweetness of the honey and bourbon well. Smooth, hint of alcohol burn remains, moderate carbonation. Just under full body. The barrel aging adds a ton of complexity to this already flavor packed base brew."
2434,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.26,"B2, shared amongst friends. Black, opaque, mocha froth head.  Aroma has booze, spicy cinnamon, vanilla and roasted malts. Flavor has a lot of fudgy chocolate with an increasing cinnamon presence as it warms. Moderate pepper heat, light vanilla in the background. The apple brandy barrel comes out as it gets close to room temperature. Moderate carbonation, syrupy, Above medium body. A tasty brew, silky, sweet. Heat is there but not overpowering."
2435,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.85,"Shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks a lot, Brad! Served alongside Stormaktsporter. 2009 vintage The beer appears quite similar to the standard version. Dark brown, nearing black, with a dark beige head that leaves an oily film gently descending the snifter. A distinctly European aroma. It seems to me that Närke, Nøgne Ø, Mikkeller, etc. possess distinctive characteristics not found in American stouts. Hooray for diversity and the unique aspects found in beers throughout the world. Anyhow...the beer smells terrific. Roast, chocolate, barrels, a touch of booze. The flavor does not disappoint. Thick, chewy, viscous stout that coats the palate and melts in your mouth. The barrel character is outstanding. Present, but not overbearing. Beautifully balanced. Dark fruits, chocolate, roast, malt, barrels blending together in harmony. Highly recommended, should you have the good fortune to sample this."
2436,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.42,"File this review under: Really expensive beer that I hate because it is so delicious. Pours a slightly darker color of gold than your average gueuze. Super thin 1/6"" white head. Aroma is kicking down some seriously sour notes, what is missing is that plastic burning feel that 3F had going on for awhile. This is just tons of lemon like sour notes and oak. Mild funk behind it, not harsh, enjoyable.  A taste that brings out citrus notes without relying too much on lemon and grapefruit solely. Very sour, but not acidic really. Effortless drinking. The notion of barnyard can only be discussed by saying it must be a very clean barnyard, the farm butthole aspect of a gueuze isn't present, thankfully. I like this more than their regular gueuze because its aroma is better and it has more of a varied citrus flavor instead of just lemon sour power. Carbonation was on point. Interesting that the alcohol is 7.5% in this one compared to the normal gueuze. Can't taste it thankfully.  Downside of this beer is that it is expensive AF. But even then, I could see spoiling myself every now and then and buying it again. ~$30/375ml. But the score suffers because of the price. If this was priced like de garde, I would say its rating would be like 4.7/5"
2437,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.28,"2009 vintage - poured from a 750mL bottle into a small snifter.  Bistre body with very little carbonation producing a tiny khaki collar; fast running tears; poor retention. Deep, sweet, fruit-heavy, rich aromatics with molasses, prunes, figs, toasted sugar, and faint tobacco. No real signs of oxidation, infection, or souring despite being 11 years old. Vanilla, caramel, toffee, treacle, dark cherries, coffee, and tobacco in the palate entry. Medium, slightly medicinal (cough syrup) finish. Complex, but possibly a bit past its prime. Sticky, medium-bodied mouthfeel with substantial but not excessive heat from the ABV.  More than the sum of its parts, this is still one of the biggest stouts available, although, consequently, it's a bit sweet/hot."
2438,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,3.97,"coffee usually creates a slightly astringent flavor for me in beers. this one is no exception. i would take base, other two variants over this any day"
2439,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.66,"2017 vintage. Wow. This one is off the charts delicious! The head is modest but it is a beautiful deep dark brown with a small amount of khaki head that fades into a light ring around glass and patches of foam on the surface. I find the coffee and cinnamon are most prevalent on the nose but you get a hint of the chocolate. The flavor is just remarkable, coffee, cinnamon, chiles come through first, the maple and cacao are on the finish which is just smooth and delightful. Kane knocked this one out of the park."
2440,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.5,"2016, batch 2, drank on 12/21/2016 Look-almost looks like a hazy ipa or pulpy orange juice Smell-not getting anything bold but it smells citrusy and tart Taste-passion fruit galore! mango and guava are there as well Feel-medium-heavy tartness, nice Overall-a nice offering here. My first J Wakefield. The flavor explosion here being under 4% is just amazing. Really nicely done"
2441,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.59,"Had on tap. How exciting, both the older and younger on the same trip to CA! Oh yeah! Orangey yellow active pour, plenty of lacing, two fingers of foam. Piney hops, hop resin, lemon, grapefruit, white grape, honey, flowers, and orange zest aromas bouquet. Taste still holds up over all these years: zesty citrus, floral and piney hops, honey, white peach, mandarin orange and a kiss of white grape. Feel is hoppy, resinous, bright, surprisingly carbonated and has a sense of booziness behind it though not tasted or smelled. Nice balance and gasp, nuance, to a big triple ipa."
2442,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.86,"L: Gorgeous cream hazy wheat. About 1/2 inch of frothy head with lacing that hangs on the side of the glass. S: Aroma comes bounding out of the can. The Citra is overwhelming, in a good way. Stone fruit, papaya, ripe melon. Wow. T: Citra at the front, leading to pine/resin, with sweet fruit here and there. Not an overwhelming alcohol-flavor either, despite the 8% F: This is quite effervescent, with a peppery and dry finish. Just an absolutely perfect amount of carbonation - enough of a bite to notice, but also simultaneously juicy and mouth-watering. O: This is a spectacular beer. What puts this double with Citra above many others is that it hits every piece perfectly - aroma, taste, mouthfeel. Many juicy IPAs pack in the aroma or flavor, but really miss with the high alcohol content and mouth feel and either come off as too strong, or flat. I grabbed this at the brewery today in a can and was so excited to have it - I'm looking forward to having it again once things open up a bit and growlers are back. Grab some cans while they are still around if you are within driving distance within VT."
2443,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.47,Pours black with two fingers mocha head that lasted for a bit.
2444,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.27,"22 ounce bottle into a snifter. Had 11/4/17. Pours dark, opaque, a little thick looking, with a one inch quickly dissipating head and spotty lacing. Aromas of maple, coffee, malt, bacon, caramel, light chocolate and cocoa, some smoke. Smells terrific. The taste also leads with maple, then malt, coffee, caramel, a little molasses, light chocolate and vanilla, somewhat smoky, maybe a hint of bacon. A little salty, not sweet. Smooth, a little creamy, well carbonated, a little bit of a lighter body feel for the style. Terrific aroma, very good flavor. All the add-ins blend together really well. The maple and coffee are the stars here. If you have the chance when it’s around, grab a couple of bottles. Good price point, too."
2445,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.93,"Bottle logic always gets me excited. However, as I’ve had them I’ve learned that they can be a little bit to touch and go- some some thing that does not apply to this one: Superb, full bodied choc-stout greatness. No wonder it’s their flagship."
2446,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.63,"Pours a bright medium gold color with a off white 2 finger silky head that has spotty lacing. The aroma has bright, floral tangerine notes. Taste is dense with very pleasant citrus hop flavor. A blast up front that stays to the finish. Not too sweet, but well balanced with a grassiness and light bitterness. Maybe a little stone fruit behind the tangerine. Very soft feel. This one has a great rating that is deserved imo. I wouldn't call it a 5 but certainly close."
2447,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.66,This was a unicorn where I'm from. I've finally got to drink it and it lives up to the hype. It might not be revolutionary anymore but it's a damn near perfect example of beer style. If you don't like this than West Coast IPAs aren't for you.
2448,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.53,"This pours a light pink (think the color of a rose wine) with a light pink head. The smell is tart raspberries with a slight barnyard funk. Overall, the nose matches the taste as this is sharp and tart with a slight amount of raspberry sweetness to balance it all out. Additionally, there is a slight barnyard funk that you'd expect in a lambic. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. Overall, a great example of the style."
2449,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.02,"2013 bottle now aged 4 years.  For the first time I'm appreciating oxidation in a beer. It certainly is but I'm strangely not put off by it. The coffee in its original form is long gone, but a shell of where it was remains with outlier elements of char, roast, and pepper. There is still a large amount of sweetness and barrel in this beer. Loads of vanilla, carmelized sugar, toffee, brown sugar and bourbon. It's leaves you dry, spicy, and satisfied Overall it's a shame I didn't get to try this fresh but even with such age it's entirely evident what a carefully crafted top tier beer this is."
2450,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.29,Columbus Hop is biting right up front. Not a huge fan of this hop. It’s creamy. Opposite beer for me. Dulled when it warmed up. Showed it’s single hopped “ Sheare’ness “. Very good. Another good one from Trill. Need to try the Dub version of this!
2451,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.09,"Presentation: 16 oz. can with the canning date printed on the bottom. Served in a Lenox Tuscany IPA glass. Appearance: The bubbly, bright white, two finger head stays around for a while and leaves behind some thick, patchy lacing. It's a hazy, bright gold color.  Smell: It's a beautiful, floral, hoppy aroma with some citrusy fruit showing up in the background like grapefruit and orange.  Taste: It's hoppy with notes of orange and grapefruit. The mildly bitter, hop resin tingle persists throughout and it has a long finish. It balances out the strong, fruit sweetness nicely. Mouthfeel: It's light to medium bodied and quite refreshing. It has a soft silkiness and medium carbonation with a crisp, dry finish.  Overall: The beer tastes great, smells wonderful and is very easy to drink. It's no wonder this is a New England favorite and one of the classic examples of the style."
2452,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.5,"Batch 2 so this was the solera. Little bit darker orange, great head. Great aroma of lambic and bright citrus along with some barrel. I could not pick out the sherry but could tell this was a different type of barrel then your standard lambic foeder/barrel that just has wood character. To be honest it really reminded me of Boon Vat 109 which is a great compliment to both beers. This was great, thankful to have a set of the new releases."
2453,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.1,"750ml Bottle at share. Cloudy watermelon color, sparse bubbly head. Tart, sweet aroma, lots of berry. Taste is strawberry with a bit of melon . Sweet and tart."
2454,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.66,"2015 vintage, drank on 7/26/2019 for a friend's bachelor party. Super funky nose, fantastic raspberry taste and smell - very natural. Beautiful pour with nice body. Really excellent."
2455,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.5,"Bottle: Poured a very dark brown color ale with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of caramelized malt with some chocolate, cinnamon and bourbon notes is quite enticing. Taste is a rich and complex mix of bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon with some floral coffee and light woody notes with some residual sugar notes also perceptible. Body is full with good carbonation and light warming notes. Exceptional beer."
2456,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.74,"2012 vintage poured into a snifter. Pours a deep orange body with a pretty frothy off white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a small ring of lacing.  Aromas are potent and forward, apparent the second it's opened. Heavy funk and wood, ripe cheese, cedar, musty basement, citrus and orange zest, tangerine.  On the tongue it's super tart with lots of lemon and barnyard, hay, yeasty funk, citrus and orange rind, finishing crisp and dry, leaving a woody, oaky, barrel flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel is easy, crisp, medium-light.  What can I say, this was one of the best Gueuze's I've ever tasted. I would drink this every day if I could."
2457,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.53,750mL bottle
2458,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.77,"2019 Coffee. Incredible brew!! Pours black with a creamy thick three finger mocha head that looks like whipped cream ( dissipates within a few minutes). Heavy lacing. Nose is fresh gourmet coffee bean, vanilla, toasted chocolate malts and slight chillis in the background. Mouth is thick and creamy with gourmet coffee, bitter sweet chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, dark fruits with a lingering subtle chili burn on the tounge."
2459,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.49,Always a solid 4.5. Great barrel even now that it is mass produced. Also a great beer to use in a French press with other things like cinnamon toast crunch. Easily one of the best shelfies to pick up. It is a thick beer that has a great barrel smell to it and a nice thick mouth feel. The look isn't anything out of the ordinary other than slightly more brown foam to it that I noticed more.
2460,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.5,"What truly surprises me about Sunday Brunch is, in spite of being a non barrel-aged beer, just how complex and layered it is. The coffee is smooth and lightly roasty. The maple isn't super forward but it adds body and subtle, excellent flavor - tasting quite natural, by the way. The beer has great body and drinks easily. I really like this one - I can't imagine drinking a whole bottle by myself, but definitely enjoyed sharing this one with friends."
2461,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.55,"Since it's a cold and rainy night with Spring fast approaching, I figured tonight was as good a time as any to break out the Founders CBS from 2018. It pours a usual dark brown color and has a chocolaty brown head. The sweetness is apparent on the nose but belies the intense maple, chocolate, and coffee flavors that masks the 10% alcohol. I'm glad to have tried this, it's definitely one to share during the colder season."
2462,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.34,Purchased one year ago at the source. Pours a cloudy yellow. Aroma is super funky. Taste largely follows. As it warms it becomes much better. Not sure I get much wine barrel in this.
2463,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.5,"Tasted in a 6 oz sampler glass from draft at Gold Eagle Wine and Spirits on April 3, 2021. Far too many coffee stouts are overwhelmed by the bitter taste of fresh brewed coffee. This is far more subtle and much better as a result."
2464,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.54,"2015. Dark brown pour with just a few bubbles that do not amount to any type of head. Smells of caramel, dark fruits, chocolate, tobacco and oak. Tastes of dark fruit with sweet flavors of chocolate, toffee, brown sugar blending perfectly with flavors of soy, oak, bourbon, leather and tabacco. Almost zero carbonation with a slightly sticky mouth feel that helps give this virtually flat beer some body. Overall, an amazingly delicious and complex BA old ale. The lack of carbonation may throw some people off, but doesn't take away from the drinking experience to me."
2465,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.47,2013 A- Straw yellow/orange
2466,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.8,"I was extremely impressed with this beer. Had it on tap at Alpine and then the Alpine pub in 2018. Malty, little to no hops, great barrel character, and smooth finish. Can't wait to try my bottle!"
2467,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.77,"Bottled, as Deschutes The Abyss Reserve 2009, kindly shared by gunnar. Pitch black colour, excellent brown head. Lovely and complex aroma of dark malts, chocolate, coffee, tobacco, liquorice and leather, also some oaky and vinous notes. The flavour has notes of heavily roasted malts, balanced by a suitable sweetness, coffee and liquorice, hints of sandalwood. Superb!"
2468,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.73,"On draft at Trillium-Canton. Appearance is basically orange juice both in color and opaqueness. Tropical fruit and great aromatic aroma. Fruity. Pineapple, mango, peach and juicy. Good mouthfeel with a bit of a dry, mild bitter hop bite at the end. Exceptional."
2469,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.59,"Succulent banana milk haze in the glass, with a solid finger of rocky white foam. Smells like a New York City fruit cart on a hot summer day. The kind of juicy, drippy ripe fruit that you can smell from a block and a half away. Taste follows with sun-warmed pineapple, lychee, and whipped cream. Mouthfeel is soft & creamy, and fully coating. Finishes with a hit of resinous pine, and orange rind. Remarkable effort in a month of truly remarkable Trillium beers."

2471,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,5.0,Amazing! Looks: 
2472,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.61,"2018 Bottle. Dark, viscous pour. As the beer fills the glass, formations of tan head rise and dance on top of the beer, settling into a small ring around the rim of the glass. After a few minutes it dissipates into a flat, black abyss. Huge amounts of dark fruit and barrel influence to the nose of this beer. To compliment those notes of plum and molasses are solid undertones of bold, dark chocolate and black licorice. Subtleties of oak and vanilla emerge as the beer continues to warm. Again, the barrel really shines here. A more rugged flavor profile, with smoked oak and leathery tobacco playing at the forefront. Behind it there's a softened, sweeter characteristic, resonating with notes of caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, brown sugar, and molasses. Together they balance each other perfectly, with the barrel influence preventing too much of a cloying sweetness on the palate. After letting your taste buds settle for a moment, there's a very present nuttiness to this beer as well, a roasty quality that further adds to the complexity of this beer. Viscous, soft, and sticky. A full-bodied mouthfeel, with a very soft yet still noticeable carbonation that clings desperately to a boozy warmth that catches you in the finish."
2473,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.59,"This actually pours almost clear if you leave the last ½ ounce in the can. A deep yellow color with a wispy foam and lot's of lacing. Definitely more of a West Coast style DIPA than NE Hazy. Dank and piney, opens up a bit as it warms. Bitter, but still goes down easily. It's one of my personal favorites and I feel is underrated. Available in growlers and 16 ounce cans. New label in February of this year."
2474,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.57,Fresh can courtesy of yllib. 
2475,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.44,Sampled at Stowe brewery and just had a can I brought home. Beer < 3 weeks old.
2476,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,3.78,"500 mL bottle. Black body. Smells of alcohol, vanilla, more alcohol, roasted and nutty malts. Some oak. Tastes of vanilla. Sharp vanilla and fruitiness. Alcohol. Rich chocolate. More alcohol. Heavy and intensely alcoholic. It's over the top in every way, but it is really well made for what it is."
2477,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.87,Tastes exactly like a chocolate dipped macaroon. Shared knocks it out of the park and balances chocolate and coconut so well in this beer. Glad I was able to try this one.
2478,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.52,"Bottle poured into fluted snifter. Slightly hazed yellow straw. Thin foamy head quickly dissipates into thin ring of bubbles around my glass. Aroma is crisp citrus, yeast, slight sweet tartness. Hint of grassy field. Crisp and clean flavors. Subtle white wine, citrus zest, sweetness comes through as delicate white fleshed fruit. Moderate carbonation and dry medium body. Overall an excellent brew. Refined flavors and perfectly balanced."
2479,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.34,"Black motor oil with a great nose of roasty chocolate and bourbon. The taste is quite similar. My bottle has been aged a bit, so it's got some oxidation. Great beer, pick one up if you see it."
2480,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.55,I picked it off a menu at Stout in LA. What an amazing aroma and taste. Could tell the hops were citrus and could smell the pine. A nice orange amber color. Left me wanting to have another as soon asI can find it again.
2481,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.37,"Review is for 2018 release of BA Sump. The pour on this is dark, like motor oil. The syrupy body doesn’t leave much to be remembered , with hardly any residual lace and a very thin head of deep tan foam. The nose starts with a very strong aroma of dark sweet fruit, swirling with chocolate and finishing with an oakey, tobacco finale. That initial surprising sweetness returns in the flavors, this time accompanied by a more present roasted malt bill and a bitter coffee finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and sticky, and overall you really see the coffee balance the barrel in the overall profile of this beer."
2482,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,3.99,16 oz can from the Wall of Beer in Clemson SC ($4.89) with a November 2020 canning date stamped on the bottom. 
2483,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.82,Just world class. Just had my second one nd would like to amend my review. Still amazing but not quite as good as my first one. A tad to sweet. But just a tad! 9/6/2021
2484,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.72,Info on the bottle:
2485,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.96,"I live in VT and buy a pack of these every couple months. Most recent was canned ten days before consumption, yesterday and tonight. About as good as beer gets, truthfully. Heady varies a bit year to year, but this year's have been excellent. Maybe it's just me, wanting a strong brew after a troubling times, maybe not. Thick hoppy, dank, and catty flavors are almost overwhelming but ever so balanced by some magical blend of juicy citrus and malty notes. Some will say it's too bitter, but I find it smoother and more drinkable than most beers of this style. Many similar beers are too sweet, or astringent and unpleasant on the throat as they warm. Heady is exemplary because it can be smooth and almost refreshing while socking you on the chin with hops.  I am biased - this beer has a place in my heart. I love to try new things, especially beer, and am lucky to live in a place where I can get lots of tasty drinks. That said, I keep coming back to The Alchemist. Not an everyday beer for me, but easily world class and a something you can feel good about buying."
2486,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.38,"A - A beauteous pour, black and opaque, mid-tan head with small bubble curtains of lacing. S - Profound chocolate batter, strong punch of alcohol burn. A touch of coconut. T - Follows the nose, with bright baked brownie, lush coffee and a coconut line. Warm alcohol prickliness. M - So full and warm, but quite drinkable. Lingers as a weight on the tongue, but not unpleasantly. O - Superb giant brew, quite delicious."
2487,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.75,"Vintage 2018 The pour is black as motor oil. The taste is dark chocolate, charred oak, roasted coffee, toasted almonds, grains, & tiramisu. Cheers! A"
2488,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.41,"2018 edition Beautiful beer, with excellent head production for the style (more than a full finger), and very good retention as well; 10 minutes after the pour, there is still a thin layer of dark foam covering almost the entire top of the ebony body, and a fairly thick collar lining the edge of the glass. The nose is promising: initially sweet, with chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, red grapes, cream, vanilla, coconut, and light bourbon mash, it quickly turns sharp and aggressive, with coffee, oak, and bourbon mash. This hits all the right notes, and implies that one should expect the full weight of the 13.6% ABV to fall upon the palate. Similarly and immediately aggressive on the palate, with bourbon and coffee leading the way. Caramel, coffee, and brown sugar at first; strong bourbon mash following, along with oak, red grapes, and molasses; very light char and nuts; a bit of booze, assertive but not harsh; coconut and vanilla tones; chocolate malt. Mouth-filling body with no fizz, and while the high ABV eventually builds some sting, you can really savor this one for quite a while before the swallow, allowing the flavors to really wash across your tongue and palate. Surprisingly semi-dry finish, with mostly dull tones of oak and ground coffee lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, creamy, and thin (not watery) for the style, instead of thick and chewy. Shockingly strong fruity tones from the coffee here - berries and earth inimitable to certain coffees (e.g. Ethiopian Harrar, or certain South American roasts); I'm not sure I've ever noticed this effect in a coffee stout before. Although that's not my favorite kind of coffee roast, it's damn impressive nonetheless. It also lasts and lasts, with these tones of barrel and coffee lingering for a good 5-10 minutes after the sip. This is not quite on the level of BCBCS, but it is definitely playing the same game, on the same level."
2489,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.37,"Appearance: Pours the color of coffee capped by an inch or so of foam; some lacing action Smell: Black cherry, chocolate, charred oak, caramel and Bourbon tones Taste: Acetic sourness juts forward, with black cherry dominant; chocolate and caramel tones soften the acidity, with the Bourbon, vanilla and oak flavors building; incredible depth in both the sour and base malt flavors are highlighted in the finish Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation; solid pucker factor Overall: A significant achievement with complexity abounding"
2490,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.58,"No bottling date, which I imagine they do intentionally to keep people from storing this long term, as it states clearly on the bottle, “drink it fresh—do not cellar!” But, I picked this up at the brewery on June 13, 2019, so I’m not taking their advice! Still a knockout Stout. Massively sweet malt in the nose and some unique coffee aromas. The incredible malt bill and maple syrup really stand out in the flavor. You get the coffee and dark chocolate throughout in the background. A bit boozy and certainly on the sweet side with a properly heavy body/feel. Wish I saved this for eggs & bacon on a weekend morning!"
2491,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.86,"'20 batch.  Maman 2020 is a blend of 2 distinct threads. The first consisting of base stout aged 22 months in Heaven Hill barrels, this comprises 80% of the blend. The remaining 20% is base stout aged 27 months on Weller barrels. We tasted through a couple dozen barrels to find a blend that best exemplifies our beloved barrel aged stout, Maman. Oak, maple, marshmallow, and caramel all dominate the aroma, with waves of rich brownie batter fudge and Heath bars wrap up the palate. We always strive for a balance of flavors in our beers, and we feel the nuance and surprising drinkability make this vintage of Maman something we’re immensely proud of. This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like high quality chocolate truffles, cookie dough, brownies, vanilla, spicy oak, caramelly bourbon, English toffee, marshmallow, heavy roast, and light smoke. This has been high on my list of ""must-tries"" for a long time, and it really did meet my expectations. It's a pure expression of the power of barrel - you could tell me this has chocolate or vanilla or caramel added to it, and I'd believe you. There's very little booze here, and there's great oaky complexity on the back end helping keep things balanced. There's some definite roast and bitterness - it's not just pure pastry here.  This is medium bodied, not the thickest stout ever, but that honestly helps here - keeping it light on its feet and very drinkable. There's barely any booze to this. It's hard to find much to fault this one for. It's truly excellent - barrel aged chocolate marshmallow chunk brownies, essentially."
2492,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.42,"Very light for it's ABV. Doesn't have the nose of some of Trillium's other IPAs, and is lighter in body than expected for the ABV. The flavor is there, notes of mango and pineapple abound. It might just need a bit more time in the can for the nose to burst free - I will re-visit if that is the case. For now, this is a solid offering with a sneaky light feel for such a big beer. I remember when 9.1% implied Triple!"
2493,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.87,"510ml bottled on 02/02/2021. ""Not packaged from resale."" Sample from the brewery. Thanks, Vinnie! I've consumed Pliny the Elder hundreds of times over the years, and most of those were on draught at The Falling Rock when I lived in Denver, but I've never sat down with a bottle for a proper review on my own. Pours a lively, light, pale, honey colored beer with a hint of haze and a thick, creamy head that laces down the glass with each sip. Big piney note in the nose with citrus and a soft floral aroma. Mouthfeel is sublime. Crisp and prickly on the palate, and then creamy, firm, a bit chewy, and incredibly smooth. Malty sweet with a light clean breadiness. Hoppy and fruity with pineapple, orange, ripe, juicy, fleshy, tropical fruits, and grapefruit rind. This is broken up by a dry bitterness with pine, resin, and an oily and ashy presence that sticks to the palate for what seems like forever. And I want it to last forever. Biscuit. Honey. Warming alcohol. Bone-dry finish. Spicy linger. Despite the market being absolutely flooded with India Pale Ales, and good number of them being what I'd consider world-class, in 2021 Pliny the Elder still stands after all these years as the gold standard for both West Coast and Double IPAs. And after drinking it countless times, it never gets old."
2494,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.2,"Appearance: A massive bubble show here, producing a two finger tan head over the espresso colored liquid; splotchy lacing  Smell: Rich milk chocolate and a modest amount of char Taste: The rich milk chocolate flavors intermingle with the roasty char tones from start to finish; the sweeter aspect wins out, eventually Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy with low to moderate carbonation Overall: Drinks much bigger than the ABV; the mouthfeel is the best part"
2495,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.4,"Poured from a can (09Jul2021) into a TH teku #properglassware L: pours a glowing, totally opaque yellow orange with a huge, thick white head that’s slowly fading. Large, chunky lacing left S: really nice fresh and juicy tropical fruit nose. Nice waves of mango, peach, papaya - some orange citrusy notes as well. It’s a brighter, freshly cut fruit type nose - less of that overly dank aroma, incredibly inviting. Slight citrusy bitterness in the background, but mostly it’s those peach and papaya notes for me T: i’m a bit mixed on the swallow here. It’s a lighter more fruit cocktail flavor than I expected, peach and citrus to open. Papaya comes through in the middle, and would say I like the flavor more as it’s warmed slightly in the glass. There’s a pleasant, lighter grapefruit bitterness that comes through in the middle and carries through the medium+ finish. Abv works well F: medium body, medium carbonation. Fairly smooth, slightly drying O: delicious DIPA that certainly grew on me. Found the nose inviting, first sip was a slight disappointment but the flavor really won me over as I drank more (8.2% abv doesn’t hurt haha)"
2496,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.91,"I've been chasing down a bottle of Atrial for a few months now - I missed it at the Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beers (FOBAB) in November of 2017 (kicked in the VIP session), and I've had a couple of trades fall through. And then, suddenly, I had TWO trades go through within a week of each other! Exciting. I shared my first bottle (blend seven) with friends recently. Atrial smells tremendous - I love the sweet, tart, rich raspberry nose. The beer itself is quite a lot dryer than I had expected and tremendously tart. It doesn't punch you in the jaw with sour, but there is a pleasant sourness to it. There is definitely a barrel presence in that dryness. I was surprised by how dry it was, given that sweet, juicy, almost cloying nose to it! While the bottle hunt was frustrating, I think it was ultimately worth it, and I'd happily do it again. I need to try more of Jester King's fruited sours - their saisons are excellent and easily purchased, but the sours are what really interest me..."
2497,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.5,"Picked-up six cans at Tree House brewery for five dollars and five cents. Canned-on date of 2/14/19. My thirty fourth brew from these guys. Known for IPAs, but don't sleep on TH stouts. This, like every other I have had from them, is outstanding."
2498,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.26,"16oz can at share. Hazy orange golden pour, foamy head. Fruity aroma, citrus, light stone fruit. Taste piles on more citrusy goodness, sweet, juicy, fruity, creamy. Solid through and through. Classic."
2499,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.6,Sampling a 2017 vintage 12 oz bottle at cellar temp and poured into my snifter. The beer has been in its box in my cellar since I purchased it.
2500,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.71,"Thanks much to chicagopubcrawler for making this one happen. Was worried about the b2 releases. This one in my opinion doesn't follow the poorer reviews.  A beautiful stout. Not a big pop off the cap but the pour has a nice thick lacing. Smell is perfect chocolate. No spice just perfect refined chocolate. Taste is a blend of crazy flavors: apple, chocolate, hard Mexican spice. Love the integration of rum and apple brandy. The spice/heat comes in at the back end as is intense. Mouth is dense and I wish more stouts could be just like this. A little harsh with the peppers. Gladly shared this with friends and definitely two people would be too much for the intensity of the heat. Overall this is an experience. I generally don't go for this style and have had both good and bad bottles of regular huna. I'm sure this was a good bottle."
2501,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.6,"04/2016 - This was a delightful mistake; huge fan of the combination of Galaxy, Mosaic, and Nelson to create a balanced juicy yet hoppy bite. Fruit for dayz!"
2502,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,5.0,"250ml Bottle First try in 2009 a 2006 Vintage. I can’t deny that I had very high expectations and really wanted for it to fulfill them. Did it ? Hell yeah ! 2006 Bottle, served in a wonderful De Molen snifter. It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wonderful deep brown head. The wonderful roasted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, some distant ripe fruit. So many flavors , so wonderfully balanced together. What really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite it’s ABV, you feel like you can have (in my dreams) many many glasses, which is rarely the case with big Imp stouts. I can’t give it anything but a perfect score and I really doubt that I will do this for another beer (certainly hope so though :D ).  Having had this on many more occasions and in many vintages, my original rating hasn’t changed a bit. i wish I could drink this every day."
2503,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.74,"Bottle from Tavour. Dark as night, flat, slick. Roasty, ashy aroma, boozy. Taste is sweet, roast malts, chocolate, and vanilla. Liquid nectar. Worth every penny."
2504,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.49,"Poured from a bottle (14Mar2018) into an apple wine glass L: pours a perfectly clear light yellow gold, more apple juice than champagne. Large white head at first that fades after a minute or so, leaving no lacing but there is a layer of bubbles on top of the beer. Moderate- visible carbonation S: all those great funky/earthy/cheesy vibes you want from a geuze. That barnyard funk, wet hay, old blanket, lactic sourness, weird cheese I would avoid in the store, some sharp green apple/lemon, apricot. Overall aroma is fairly light, especially considering the incredible depth T: more acidic than the nose, delivering a great mix of funky and earthy flavors with a great drying character. Bitterness to open, balanced well by the fruit flavors and the earthier funk notes. Get that green apple/lemon zest flavor, more of that apricot plus peach especially toward the finish. Long finish, a bit of that acidity lingers with the fruit notes sticking around F: medium- body, high- carbonation quite effervescent dances on the tongue, drying, acidic but not overly so - gets up to that line and beautifully pulls back. O: a stellar geuze, as expected. The flavors and depth in this beer are truly world-class, always delivers"

2506,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.17,"Looks great and smells OK but compared to DDH Fort Point this is kind of a let-down. Bought in Boston and drank fresh. Side-by-side with DDH Fort Point and DDH Stillings Street, this was the worst of the three----but still an overall great Trillium beer!"
2507,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.48,"12/2013 - Big pineapple and orange nose, with some grapefruit lingering; large hop body with resinous notes dominating, and fruity grapefruit in the back; tangy bitterness on finish."
2508,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.43,"They have brewed this beer every year for the last 3 years straight and it's considered ""retired"" - when was the last time Oude Fermier or Ann was freshly brewed? those are still on the top 250 list- just food for thought. Leaner b2 pours a beautiful orange glow, the dregs at the end of the of the bottle were added to everyones glass and added a hazy dreamsicle look."
2509,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.47,"Poured from the bottle into a branded stemware Fonteinen glass. Bottled June 26th 2018. Season 17/18 Blend no. 66. Deep orange bodied, opaque, but with a great tangerine glow, faint edge haze as well. Nice amounts of side carbonation, very fine almost microscopic, making the glass move when observed from a distance. Off white head, dissolves to a standard pencil thin white collar, not a very active center puck, only mildly. Still very nice looking gueuze, not the best I have seen from Drie F, but certainly fine. What the beer doesn't excite in appearances, it so far makes up in spades in aroma. Even sitting at a distance it hits me. Big funk, sharp marmalade and white pepper notes coming off in big quantities. Flirts with tangerine like orange, hits of fireplace ash as well among the pepper like nose too. Seems to stay away from complexity and bold fruit, but it's classic profile is very nice. Palate just provides a golden touch. Liquid soft bodied, with a hint of light bubbled carbonation that cuts a joyful rich body. Pepper ash and a big citrus funk in the mid palate, lemons, tangerine, more marmalade sprinkled with muted pepper warmth and heat. Silky finish, nearly honey like feel. Finish gets more orange centered in flavor, with a juicy quality mixed with excellent funky character. Reading the bottle, spring honey added, woah didn't expect that! May not be the most exciting of the makers products, but is pure liquid gold in the glass."

2511,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,1.45,"Another porter from Funky Buddha that didn’t live up to the hype for me. Look: Light-medium bodied, leaning more towards light. Pours black with about a quarter inch of head. Nose: Nice coconut and coffee aromas. Taste: Coconut is the most pronounced flavor, and mildly enjoyable with a hint of coffee. Feel: Was hoping for a nice robust porter. Way too thin in my mouth for what I’m looking for. Overall: It’s not terrible. Better than the Maple Bacon Soda they pass off as beer. But like the MBP, with a 99 rating on this site, and the great reviews, I expected much more. Not impressed, won’t do again."
2512,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.6,Pours a totally black with a near non existent head. It smells mostly like vanilla with hints of chocolate and coffee underneath. The taste is mainly a sweet dark chocolate with vanilla and a slight coffee bitterness with a very slight hint of the pepper on the finish as it warms up. This one is very lightly carbonated and goes down more than easily for 12% alcohol. Overall a very very good stout.
2513,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.47,"L:. Pours a slightly cloudy ruby red with a medium fizzy white head that dissipates rather quickly and no lacing on the glass. S:. Fresh toasted bread, tart cherry and tart raspberry, a note of funky brett and a touch of vanilla, very little sweetness, more tart than sour. T:. Tart raspberry, followed by a strong tart cherry, notes of toasted bread and a touch of brett funk. Overly really like the cherry and raspberry character of this beer. Very little sweetness. F:. Prickly carbonation, and medium body. O:. I really enjoy the raspberry and cherry of this beer."
2514,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.51,"I've had a few Geueze before but I believe this is the one I like the best. Full of flavor, tart, oak, yet smooth and easy drinking at the same time. It is delicious. Look: semi-clear golden-amber with a thin fizzy white head Aroma: green apple, lemon, oranges, oak Taste: green apple, lemon, oranges, white grapes, champagne, oak, a tad of yeast. Feel: light and somewhat bubbly, champagne like"

2516,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.46,"absolutely incredible ipa here, the original style vermont ipa, before everything had to get all messed up. pure mosaic here too, in a way i havent known these hops to be in many years, like they have actually been juiced, insanely fresh, and like a concentrated version of themselves, its outrageous in both aroma and flavor, lemon and tangerine and lemongrass and pineapple notes, but also some tea and flowers and botanicals, like nothing else. a million or more beers feature mosaic hops right now, but none like this. just a bit hazier looking than expected, this is pretty thick and even faintly green hued, nice head on it, but not the brightest or sexiest looking ipa. who cares when it smells and tastes like this through, bursting with everything i love about mosaic hops and nothing i dont. i almost think for a second there is some lactose in this, not because its sweet at all, but because there is an insane degree of creaminess to the soft and expansive texture, like satin on the palate, like i want to dive into it. bitterness is really low here, especially for how intense the hops are, its its juicy all the way through the finish. subtle notes of marshmallow, french melon, and kiwi fruit here too. overall just a splendid ipa, they way these should be, and a leader in a very crowded style. this blew me away. dying to try the other beers in this series now!"
2517,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.85,"I had this for the first time in 2020. I was outside and it was cold and when this hit my lips, I drifted off to heaven. The hype is real with this one!!!"
2518,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.15,"This was a huge beer, it was incredibly thick and heavy on the palate, which is why I knocked a few points off the feel, as it was way too heavy for a sour. That said, it was well executed. You can taste all of the elements involved. The spiced red ale base blends together well with the bourbon and wine barrels. The sour bite comes on strong with the finish."
2519,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,5.0,"Outstanding beer. Super well balanced and super tasty. Toppling is by far , one of top breweries that continually puts out great product and this one is no different."
2520,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.64,"Damn good beer, and I'll try to keep the review short. It's sludgy going down for sure, its a heavy stout and that's just something that comes with these kind of beers. Not my favorite consistency, but everything else makes up for it. Tastes delicious, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate all come together for an incredible flavor profile. The 14.6% ABV is hid really well. Heck, this beer is so delicious, I could drink 3-4 of these and then be absolutely floored after it all sets in. Worth it 100% Picked up 3 from Total Wine, but regret not getting more!"
2521,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.35,"Canned 11/20/20. ""Green for you, green for me"" stamped on the bottom Of the new to me beers in the mixed case I got from Tree House last week, this is the highest rated on here. Currently sitting at #56 all time. Let's see if it lives up to the hype Pours a hazy pale orange with 3 fingers of dense soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing Green is probably the best descriptor for the aroma here. The hops are lush, grassy and oily, but counterbalanced by soft malt, pepper, and tropical fruit aromas of cantaloupe, pineapple, and blood orange The hops on the front end of the taste are so bright and citrusy, huge notes of tangerine, fresh cut pine, orange, and pineapple. On the swallow, this sadly does not find the balance I was expecting. The grassy hops are dialed up, along with notes of grapefruit and pale malt. Not mind blowing, but still a solid flavor A medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, which works well with the hop intensity, creating a fresh and crisp drinking experience. Finishes mostly dry and a touch bitter It's funny, this is one of the highest rated brews in the world, but I just wasn't that impressed. Is it well executed? Yeah, of course. I just think it could do more in the way of balance"
2522,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.65,"Really dark brown color with mocha head. Aroma has nice bourbon, cacao, caramel, fudge and a hint of sweetened coffee. Taste has fresh ground coffee, well integrated bourbon, toffee and fudge. Bitter, roasty finish with lingering caramel. Medium plus body, medium carbonation, soft on the palate. A really well made, tasty, coffee stout."
2523,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.23,"Almost fully opaque yellow-orange with a thick, convex white steamed milk-like froth settling in lumps with some spotty leopard lace. Smell is dank, spicy and peppery with tropical notes of pineapple, passion fruit and peaches, ending with light biscuit. Taste is apricot, green mango, kiwi and pineapple with spicy eucalyptus and pine, as well as a bit of toasty cracker on the swallow. A light, soft yet crisp fizz runs through the tingly light body that finishes chalk dry."
2524,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.7,Lucky enoug that Upright Brew House in the West Village (NYC) was pouring drafts of Susan. Never a surprise to be impressed by Hill Farmstead.  L: approachable orange haziness 
2525,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.33,"Poured from the growler into a standard pint glass. Appearance: The beer pours black as night with a finger of really dark brown head that leaves a ring around the pour. Smell: Really sweet with dark chocolate and dark fruit notes. I'm getting the cinnamon, chillies, and vanilla. The brandy heat is there along with the sweetness. Taste: Lots of brandy here. The malt and brandy combine to make this one very sweet. Tons of chocolate with pepper spice, mild vanilla, dark fruit, and some alcohol. The finish is peppery and sweet. Mouthfeel: The body is very thick with tingly carbonation and a finish that is a bit dry. Overall: I thought this beer was good, but I enjoy the regular version more. Quire complex and I would love to have it again."
2526,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.46,"Pours a bright orange-yellow color. Completely opaque, somewhat thickish. Lovely three finger head forms on the beer, lingers, and then dissipates leaving a thin layer of residual foam on top of the beer. Aroma has notes of bright citrus, papaya, pineapple, with some light dank hoppy notes. Its really nice - balance of sweetness, fruit but with some bitterness.  Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange rind, mango, papaya and peach - sweet but not overly so. A nice bitterness on the back end cuts that sweetness down and balances it out a bit. There are some light straw notes and a certain grassiness to the beer. Feel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, somewhat drier finish.  Overall its a lovely NE style IPA and definitely worthy of the high ranking here. Its not often these days that a NE style IPA impresses me, but this one did."
2527,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.04,"2020 20.8 abv Disappointed with this release. Crazy legs and some notable heat on this one, which is to be expected from a BT variant, especially at this abv. However, it lacks all the nuance I expect from a BT. I can definitely taste the base beer, but not much else. Even the base beer is not as prominent because it shares the stage with the taste of booze. I think I detect a trace of rum and barrel, but it is so insignificant that I could easily just be convincing myself of something that really ain't there. Compared to other BT variants, this ain't it. Compared to other big rum barrel aged stouts, this definitely ain't it. This was my first experience with BT rum barrel aged and rum barrels just so happen to be my favorite medium to age stouts. From the looks of other reviews, this should have been a tasty damn beer. Maybe next year."
2528,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.59,Soft ripe exotic grape creamy with enough lactic but not too much not yogurt level. Next level blending skills or just right in my wheelhouse. Absolutely reccomend if given the chance to try. Possibly a touch above Fou?
2529,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,3.7,"Pours an almost entirely dark color with a bigger, soft beige head, collapsing to a coating ring of lacing. Smells of toasty coffee beans dipped into maple syrup, topped off by a generous amount of cinnamon. This creates a complex, earthy impression, countered by warm chilies and chocolaty bitter cocoa nibs. A milky, soothing, flowery note evolves from this, emphasizing roasted coffee with a sweet edge to it. Has a very silk, lighter mouthfeel to it, with a helping thickness from the syrup, complimented by a low level of carbonation. Makes the beer easy drinking, while, at the same time it provides an ongoing, long lasting flavor evolution on the tongue. Tastes of milk coated cinnamon roll among charred coal, milk chocolate and a gentle dryness from the red berries inheriting coffee. Turns even silker after that, with a sweet, maple syrup peak to it among roasty hazelnuts and molasses. Finishes with a slowly evolving coffee dryness from the well entangled coffee with a well working companionship of cinnamon and syrup.  Not really picking up any chilies, mouthfeel on this is almost a little thin, but the interplay of the remaining ingredients makes up for it, as they provide a great intensity on the palate. The adjuncts dominate the flavors, while they create a great composition among themselves."
2530,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.48,"One of the rare reviews I'll do, NOT from stream-of-consciousness, but rather from notes I wrote down. I drank this can in the mountains a few hours ago, in silence, save for the rushing river next to me. An experience. A world of thanks to Jon for this can. Pint can dated 10/11/18 - poured into a tulip at about 45 degrees. Pours an unbelievable glowing neon orange juice color. Completely opaque. Creamy, milky, turbid, murky, all of it. Haze for dayz. Almost literally glows in the dark.  Nose has an undeniable dankness to it, and some exotic floral notes I cannot place. Creamy and musty with round, yeasty notes. Very unique hopping. Overall, the nose is mellow, but what it has going on is unique. Truly smells like a hop galaxy, if that makes any sense. I know it doesn't. Palate is earthy eucalyptus, lavendar, manuka honey notes, vanilla, and some exotic floral accents, that I have not experienced before. Moderate to decent sweetness in the middle, and finishes with ZERO bitterness. Some Douglas fir (piney lemon) dryness, but absolutely no bitterness. Finishes floral, pine, eucalyptus, and yeast notes. Vanilla lingers extremely long into the finish. Getting what I can only describe as a birthday cake note. Cake batter. Flavor profile is very round, full, floral, earthy, and impressions of sweet things without the sweetness.  Mouthfeel on this is truly divine, and even goes toe to toe with Julius. Luscious, pillowy, soft, round, full. The word in a nutshell is fluffy. This is a fluffy beer. Excellent carbonation gives it a touch of lift, but doesn't sharpen it. World class feel. Amazing. Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. A truly delicious and pleasing beer. Satisfying. Exotic hops give unique floral impressions that I haven't experienced before. Must be unique to Galaxy. Restrained, balanced, and soft spoken. It doesn't come out and demand you acknowledge it's presence. It remains quiet, mysterious, and alluring, and waits for you to come to it, recognizing its greatness on your own. I enjoyed every last drop of this beer, and will seek it out again at all costs. You should too, because it is a fantastic beer, with a fantastic feel, and some very unique character and nuance. Special."
2531,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.46,"Presentation: 375mL brown bottle with the bottling date printed on the label. Served in a goblet. Appearance: The thick, rocky, three finger head goes down slowly and leaves behind a lot of patchy lacing. It's a hazy, bright, reddish copper color. Smell: It's a beautiful fruity and funky smell with notes of cherries, grapes, plums, raisins and wood. Taste: It's a mildly sour, acidic and dark flavor. At first there's cherries, dried plums, and grapes. That's followed up by an earthy, humid wood note and a distinct herbal aftertaste with a touch of wine-y alcohol. Mouthfeel: It's soft and smooth but quite crisp with medium-high carbonation. It's not cloying despite the sweetness.  Overall: A rich, fruity and complex beer with a lot of layers that feels boozier than the 7.5% ABV would suggest."
2532,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.75,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into an Angry Chair pint glass. Thanks Ryan for sharing this one.  Aromas are straight chocolate cake batter intermingled with some bourbon, cocoa, chocolate fudge, hershey’s syrup.  On the tongue is rich chocolate fudge, sweet chocolate cake with a dark chocolate frosting. Bourbon barrel adds a vanilla-caramel flavor in the background, but the dominant flavor is straight fudge cake. Full-bodied with a rich, thick mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Low carbonation. This is most definitely a sipper.  This beer may be the king of pastry stouts – it’s literal liquid chocolate cake, as the name suggests."

2534,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.0,"Central Waters Black Gold BA Stout 2017, 13.2% ABV (as listed by taproom). Pours black with no head. Nose is bourbon, chocolate, and licorice. Taste follows, with moderate bitterness, and quite boozy. Decent mouthfeel, overall excellent. I've been hunting this whale for three years, and was a bit let-down. It was decent, but not as good as its reputation."
2535,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.5,"Waxed bomber received Bif 12 from @pinz 2018 Reserve Imperial stout brewed with Black strap molasses and licorice, dry spiced with cherry bark and vanilla bean , 50% aged in bourbon , wine and new Oregon all barrels  Poured into a snifter , two finger thick , creamy brown foam cap, very good retention , settles to a tick layer with very good lacings over black motor oil  Aroma of roast malts , bourbon, licorice, tobacco  Taste is roast malts, licorice, hint of oak , char ,  Smooth , creamy , semi dry finish  Great stout"
2536,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.4,"This one was hard to find but I found some randomly on a shelf and was shocked. Be careful with this one (high ABV) and if you drink one bottle alone, it will sneak up on you fast! Tastes so good it's hard to sip!"

2538,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.24,"4 week old can poured into a Teku. Peach juice coloring (beautiful darkwe orange-gold), fully opaque but not turbid, with an amazing soapy head of eggshell bubbles. Nice head retention and fantastic lacing. Wonderful creaminess to the liquid. Fairly mild nose, but what is there is lovely. Lots of ripe fruits, especially orange, grapefruit, blueberries, pineapple, passionfruit, peach, grape, lemon/lime, and perhaps a little mango. Nice dankness, quite grassy, with a lovely floral quality. A little honeysuckle and bubble gum With a slight mineral note. Ripe orange comes on strong late. Attractive and clean. Taste is similarly mild, though here the Juicy Fruit gum note makes its appearance. More orange, grass, and bubblegum than anything else, but there is a nice medley of fruit in the background, with berry and grapefruit popping through the most distinctively. Mildly sweet but with a strong grapefruit pith to balance it out. Quite delicate and clean, but I appreciate it more and more (and pick up additional nuances) the longer I sip on it. Hard to compare to the hop bombs that have taken over the hazie world since Tree House first started making beers like this. This one doesn’t jump out at you but is excellent for what it is. Wonderful, lasting ruby red grapefruit — pithy and sweet — lingers forever. As it warms, the stone fruit becomes much more prominent on the nose and tongue. And interestingly it develops a bit of a sharp alcohol bite. Pretty surprising for a sub-7% beer. Feel is soft and silky but a touch thinner than the creamy look would suggest. Still, incredibly smooth and drinkable. Really fantastic, and clearly incredibly well-crafted, but I’m not sure it’s world class. So tough for beers like this to live up to expectations, but I would happily drink this anytime I had access to it."
2539,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.6,One of my favorite BA stouts. 
2540,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.46,Look...very lovely A-typical hazy Vermont ipa. Hazy yellow brown
2541,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.59,"2014 vintage, poured from a 375. Pours a golden hue with ample carbonation. Considerably more complex than the typical Geuze - crisp apple and funk. Would age very nicely."
2542,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.52,"So wow, honestly one the finest BA Barleywines I have every had.... Poured into a 13 oz Game Of Thrones Glass aged for 2 years in bourbon barrels bottled in the last two months. Pours a gorgeous chestnut with a 2 plus finger off white head that leaves a few thin wisps of lace. 4.75 Smell starts with Oaked woody bourbon, chestnut, vanilla, toffee, caramel, dates, hard cider, and a little more booze that tickles and warms the nose. 4.5 Taste follows bold vanilla bourbon, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, nutty, biscuity grain, and again the warming booze shows up and warms me belly! 4.5 Mouthfeel is rather large, creamy with gentle carbonation, slightly dry in the finish, and I assume this is around 11.5 or 12% ABV, but the bottle doesn’t list, dipper for sure but because of its complexity pretty easy sipping. 4.5 Overall one of if not the greatest BA Barleywine I have had the pleasure of drinking, wowza and cheers! 4.5"
2543,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.6,"This thing is way under the radar. Black pour, thick dense head, and lots of bourbon and vanilla to enjoy on the nose and palate. Smooooothness and Drinkability is the story on this one!"
2544,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.18,"for all the hype around this, and the others in the series (this being my first of them), i was a little let down by this, as good as it is. its awesome beer no doubt, but seems almost big for the sake of being big, less balanced than many of their others, and frankly a little sloppy at the seams, especially when it warms up a bit, but thats being critical i suppose. the beer is thick and deep brown, long legs on the edges of the glass like a big cabernet, not much head after the initial pour. sweet sun tan sort of coconut to this, pungent even above the huge dark malt base, but with a surprising degree of toasted nuttiness and bitter roast on the back end, there is a lot going on here, but the coconut feels forced to me, like it could be scaled back in a somewhat lesser beer, its overly intense, despite tasting great, its less of a natural union than i had imagined. some alcohol burn here though the residual sweetness, which has an almost toffee flavor to it, more than a suggestion of coffee, bold vanilla, and sticky caramel. it could use a little more carbonation, it drinks like blacktop sealant honestly. its cool beer, but for this variant anyway its overhyped and not as dialed as the rest of the weldwerks portfolio seems to be. still amazing beer, a must try for those who dont mind a little of the sweet fakey over the top coconut, but it might be a better beer without that element..."
2545,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.4,"Split the 750ml bottle two ways; chilled out in my fridge since the release. Not sure if some of the sweetness and coffee flavor was subdued by Father Time but, if it was, that only would've made the beer taste that much better to my pillow-soft palate. Heavily flavored stouts, especially big coffee brews, taste cloying and acidic. I was fully prepared for this beast to be over-the-top sticky and sweet but it turned out to be an exceptionally full-flavored stout with an incredible mouthfeel. I wouldn't reach for a bottle every weekend but, damn, I'd sure as hell like the chance to have it more often than once. Pitch black with a puffy, cardboard-colored head. Thick and inviting when it's there, the head doesn't last long but it makes an impression. The aroma - like a puppy made out of German chocolate cake and expresso, sitting in your lap and breathing in your face. Unavoidable, powerful, aromatic. The description is no liar - ""tiramisu, sweet chocolate cake, and smooth vanilla."" I shit you not, brothers and sisters. But, as I stated before, it's an expert blend that pulls together the components to create a cohesive sweet, slightly bitter and coffee-forward taste that slides over the palate, pumps the brakes and takes it's sweet time pulling away.  Thick, viscous, full-bodied. Huge mouthfeel; like a hippo in kiddie pool.  Awesome beer. Wish I had more."
2546,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,5.0,Not my favorite beer but if they can make a triple ipa taste this good it deserves a perfect score. It’s bitter but you can stilll taste fruitiness in it
2547,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.25,Really hazy yellow color with off-white head. Aroma has pineapple and white grapes. Taste is yeasty with some dough bitterness and citrus rind on the finish. Medium body and carbonation. Yeasty with a leafy hop bitterness. Not as good as expected.
2548,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.6,"Freekin’ wonderful. Didn’t have a clue what I got other than trying to do some homework to maximize my trip to THouse. I really like stouts and as I am here at my iPad scarfing down this beer I can only say, the description on the can says it all for me. Ditto!"
2549,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.87,Absolutely pehenomenal beer! Pours pitch black in a snifter. Super sweet coconut on the nose with barrel adding complex sweetness. Super smooth with a nice sweetness when tasting it. Tastes like a tootsie roll. One of the best beers I have ever had!
2550,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.94,"Canned 10/1/20  Poured into a pint glass yields a fluffy 1 finger head and moderate lacing, it's color looks a lot like a glass of orange juice. Aroma is tropical and citrus as in oranges, pineapple, mango and pink grapefruit. Taste is tropical fruit juice, orange juice and hints of mango and sweetened grapefruit. Mouthfeel is full, medium carbonation and smooth. Slightly sticky sweet with a mild bitter citrus rind finish.  Overall I feel it's a perfectly balanced NEDIPA juice bomb. It's sweet but not overly sweet, the citrus and tropical fruits come out but not over powering and it has a nice slightly bitter finish that lends to a lingering orange taste."
2551,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.5,"Had a few of these on draft the other day at The Tinker's Son in Norwell for eight dollars a pop! I prefer this to Congress Street, less of the mango taste. Would buy if I saw in cans, but not for $8/."
2552,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.66,"This was outstanding. Had 4 SP fruits in a night and this was the clear favorite. Massive wine grape, mildly tart. Not overwhelmingly sour. Unreal this was 10%. Hides ABV well."
2553,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.17,"10oz tulip on tap at THG.  A: Pours a deep burnt golden with a finger of sticky, greasy, off-white head that held great retention. The head eventually faded into a thick collar leaving sheets of sticky lace down the glass. "
2554,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.62,"Poured from a 500mL bottle into a bottle logic snifter. Acquired in a trade.  Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a light brown two finger head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a ring of foam and little lacing.  Aromas of sweet milk chocolate, cocoa, light cinnamon, vanilla-bourbon, and a very light booziness come through. Aromas are not overly potent but definitely reflect the ingredients.  On the tongue is sweet but not cloyingly sweet cinnamon hot chocolate, milk chocolate and cocoa, very well executed medley of mexican stout flavors, a little spiciness from the peppers, followed by a roasty stout character. Mouthfeel is SUPER thick, rich, probably the best aspect of this beer. Medium carbonation.  A fantastic beer and great execution of the mexican style imperial stout. So thick and rich, nice balance of flavors with nothing taking over."
2555,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.18,"From a 16oz can: Appearance: Gold, some particles in solution, huge head. Smell: Citrusy. Taste: Moderately sweet to start, then hits with solid citrus bitterness. A little booze is detected. Overall: Nice old school DIPA from 3 Floyds. Not super bitter, but definitely more than most hoppy beers these days. Solid citrus flavor and not too boozy."
2556,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.35,"I've been chasing this beer for a while now - bottle counts always seem lower than other adjuncted variants, and no one seems to want to let one go. So, finally caught it on tap this year! The beer obviously changes a bit in the barrel (see all of the variants) - what once was a cloyingly unpleasant, overly sweet beer turns in to a much more balanced, not-insultingly sweet beer that almost has a sort of buttery taste and aroma to it. It's thick and rich, of course, with lightly disguised bourbon. This feels like a trick. I almost wondered whether I had the right beer. It's great - it still lets me down a bit, after these years of chasing... still, great."
2557,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.46,"From the bottle it pours a red/raspberry color. The appearance is clear with visible carbonation. A modest head quickly dissipates. A funky nose immediately hints at the tartness to come. Fruity aromas evoke notes of sour raspberries, as well as lemon and lime. Insanely tart with a vinegar like acidity somewhat tempered by raspberry flavors. Additional notes of lemon, lime, oak, and peppery spices, as well as a solid doughy malt backbone that tries its damndest to provide a semblance of sweetness. The finish is bone dry and mouth puckering. Medium bodied with a lively carbonation.The mouthfeel has a piercing acidity throughout. As good as an authentic Belgian lambic and intense in its acidity. Not for the faint of heart, however, a must try if you’re a fan of the style."
2558,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.92,First year it has been bottled and my first time getting it. Bottle date 2-14-2020 poured into a tulip glass. Look- A clean orange-yellow mix with over one finger of thick white head. Great lacing around the glass and a thin head lingered for a long time. Smell- Floral aroma with piney tones mixed. A light aroma of citrus comes through as it aired out. Taste- A nice citrus floral mix with a nice hop bite that reminded me it was over 10% ABV. So good! Mouthfeel- The carbonation was mild to medium and it worked great.  Overall- Believe the hype. This brew is amazingly well done and you would not guess where the ABV is at. Definitely get it if you can.
2559,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.96,"Blessed. A perfect name for this beer. Anyone who gets to try this one is truly blessed. It is everything you want and unrivaled. The beer is a combination of 1 year and 3 year barreled stouts. The color and flavor are deeper than a dark dungeon on Halloween. The near burnt caramel resonates in every sip. It mimics the best dessert/sauce you ever had, like it came from a three star Michelin pastry chef. When poured, the black elixir resembles an obsidian robe. There is also a bombardment of high quality vanilla bean that layers on top of everything else. The beer just takes you to a different place and deserves to be recognized as elite.

2561,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.75,"This is the best sour saison I have ever had. Not even up for debate. The apricot is the perfect star for all of the delicately balanced flavors in the original. Has a bit of wine dryness to go with the sour and smooth tartness that really made the mouthfeel just mind-bendingly good. Rich, complex, smooth and acidic."
2562,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.73,"Batch 2, snifter, shared with my brother L: black, oil, quarter inch brown head that sticks around for a minute or so"
2563,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.27,"appearance is pretty standard tree house haze with good carbonation. Aroma is citrus, and some dank ness. The taste is some orange, citrus zest, earthy hops, and a little Dankness rounding it out. Mouthfeel is also amazing, as per usual tree house. Creamy, slick, medium, but also a little light. Not thin, just very easy drinking with adequate carbonation. Overall this is very good, I’m in the 4.25 range"

2565,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.66,"Delicious. Smooth with tons of flavor. Fruity, hazy, with a great finish. Definitely not overdone with the alcohol content like some double IPAs have. To be honest surprised it’s a double IPA almost to smooth to be a double."
2566,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.52,"16 oz can dated 1/12/2021. This is from the DC brewery I believe. Hops: Citra I had this one on tap a few years ago at Other Half in Brooklyn and it was excellent. This beer? Overly astringent, bitter and dry. Little hop character in the nose and taste. Disappointing."
2567,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.37,"Overwhelming vanilla smell and taste - hides the alcohol remarkably well and very smooth. I felt it was a bit thin and more like a porter consistency, but nevertheless it is quite decadent and worth the effort if you are fond of vanilla."
2568,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.29,"Canned 9/22/20, tasted 11/1/20. This is my least favorite of Tree House's ""flagship"" offerings. The most bitter of the bunch, compared with Haze, Sap, Julius, and Alter Ego. For some people that might be a strength, but for me, I would have liked more of a sweet and juicy backbone to balance out that bittnerness. The look is appealing, and the feel is very nice and smooth, although has less of the fluffy character that I love in a number of TH beers."
2569,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.81,"Poured from a can (06Apr2021) into a wineglass L: pours a darker creamy and totally opaque orange with a huge slightly off-white head that fades slowly. Leaves chunky lacing when it does, as does each sip. Some very green vibes here S: ohhh baby. So much orange, pineapple, mango. A really rich tropical nose, with great bitterness cutting through that overripe fruit aroma. Creamy orange, just cracked can of dole pineapple juice, freshly cut mango, citrusy bitterness to balance it all out T: follows the nose well, orange takes the lead to open with the rest of that tropical fruit mix following close behind. Creamy orange gives a bit more of a sweet flavor, along with a ton of fresh cut, drippy mango and chunks of juicy pineapple. That bitterness is present start to finish, lurking behind the fruit to open and then taking over as the fruit fades, into the medium/long finish. Not much on the abv front, blends well with the rest of the beer F: medium carbonation, medium+ body, very smooth, very slightly drying O: high expectations going in, not disappointed. Huge nose and flavor, perfect bitterness on a very smooth and pillowy brew. Think JJJ is my favorite of the family so far, but damn this is worth it"
2570,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.67,"Slap a Toppling Goliath label on this and all of a sudden it would be a perfect 5 haha.  Seriously though, this is perfection at its most subtle. This beer is the perfect rendition of what a regular non adjunct beer should be. This is a true must for a REAL beer appreciation fan who doesn't need fancy pastry gimmicks to make an amazing brew. Great job"
2571,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.36,"poured into a tulip glass via can dated 2/14/2019 color is a nice deep shade of brown smell is chocolate, a dash of vanilla and faint burnt coffee taste is sweet creamy coffee with vanilla and caramel..everything blends well carbonation is a bit high for a stout, but thats OK mouthfeel is surprisingly full for a milk stout with this ABV good stuff"
2572,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.5,"L: Golden/orange with a touch of haze, thin head, and little lacing. S: Honey, flowers, apricot, a touch of vinegar. Funky notes intermingles as well, some classic Brett barnyard character. Bready malt. T: Very tart and tangy, apricot, honey crisp apple, honey, and some citrus flavors. Some bready malt on the finish, but stays fruity and sour the whole way through. F: Moderate body, fine carb but nice crispness. Dry finish. Overall: An absolute pleasure of a beer. Not super sour either, even for a vintage from 2018. I highly recommend this to any fan of the style."
2573,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.06,"Living in MA, I don’t get this beer very often. I recently acquired 3 fresh bottles. It’s a good beer, it’s well balanced and dank but I don’t think it holds up to more modern ne/hazy dipas. I even think HT is much better in regards to a more American style double. That said, it’s a very enjoyable beer."
2574,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.4,"Canned 07/23/19. Enjoyed 08/21/19. Pours a thoroughly hazy light straw colour with fluffy off-white head. Head lasts quite a while and there are significant sheets of lacing during drinking. Aroma isn't huge but has a nice citrus, melon hop aroma along with almost a white grape / wine characteristic of some Brut IPAs I've had recently. Was some Nelson Sauvin used along with the ""almost entirely"" Mosaic? Taste follows the nose with hints of sweet orange juice, melon, pineapple, and again that slight white wine. I say all hints because this is not a huge juice or hop bomb, but rather just a well crafted balanced IPA with many subtle flavours and nothing to blow your socks off or take over the taste. Some grassiness and sweet tartness appear at the end of the sip along with just a hint of non-astringent bitterness to let you taste those hops right to the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately full. This is a very nice IPA, not as big of a taste as I've grown to enjoy, but refreshing & very enjoyable nonetheless."
2575,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.65,From a can dated 4/22/19. Up there with Minot's Ledge as one of their top Galaxy bombs. Does not have a heavy feel to it even at 8.5%. An exceptional beer.
2576,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.43,"Orange juice like color. Head was white, what little I could create. No lacing. Nose is very citrusy. Taste is all the labeled tastes, pineapple, mango and orange juice. Very Lots on tingle on the gums with a bitter bite. Good Stuff"
2577,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.15,"From a 2019 bottle. Pour left a very quickly receding brown foam head that reveals a dark brown to black body. Scent is very, very bourbon heavy along with notes of burnt sugars, vanilla, and molassess. Taste is much more on the sweet (caramel, butterscotch) than alcohol side, although the high ABV really bleeds into the aftertaste. Such a fascinating array of flavors that must be consumed slowly (both due to the ABV, sweeter flavors, and alcohol aftertaste)."
2578,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.49,"Pours a ruby mahogany, 1"" loose tan head, moderate retention. Nose is rich with raisins, stewed prune, roasted cherry, rum-soaked fruit cake, fruit wood, baking spice, fruity yeast esters, and alcohol. Taste follows up front with rich, dark fruit notes, but there isn't an overwhelming sweetness here, similar to a deep molasses. Mildly bitter, tannic notes as well balance out the fruitier notes. Toasted brown bread expresses itself midpalate. On the finish, fruity, yeasty flavors carry through along with well-expressed alcohol. Mouthfeel is moderate with sharp carbonation."

2581,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.59,"L: Pours a beautiful golden color. 2 fingers of foamy head with good retention. S: Wonderful aroma of tropical fragrances, floral aromas, and just enough pine to let you know this is a West Coast style IPA.  T: A nice combination of fruity flavors with a delicious piney Hop residue on the back end. F: Very smooth, easy drinking. High drinkability. Feel like you could crush this no problem.  O: This might be the best West Coast style IPA I've had. this has a lot more balance than many of the east coast style IPAs I've had. Bottom line, fantastic beer."
2582,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.97,"On tap at the brewery. Get there EARLY to get a park. My favorite draft IPA to date, smooth and power-flavors with excellent finish. Great staff at Heist let me sample others without asking. Highest recommendation! Also got some 16 oz cans for my homeboys as I live 259 miles away"
2583,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.43,"Hazy orange juice, small head diminishing quite fast."
2584,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.68,"Appearance was tan to dark, nose was a little coffee and some sweetness, taste still had great coffee and plenty of oak and vanilla, feel was velvet and smooth similar to a good barrel aged wheat wine. Amazing that this beer packs a 19%+ abv. Overall, still drinking fantastically four years later."
2585,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.6,"Got this in a trade with Jay Whitson. Thanks Jay!! 2018 edition, waxed and capped.  Pours as pretty as a barrel aged Stout can get. Pitch black, 2 fingers of tan foam, superb lacing and head retention.  Smells of Bourbon, winter spicing..cinnamon and nutmeg, roasty, chocolate of the sweet kind, little bit of coffee, very boozy.  Lots of lovely cinnamon up front, a mix of both dark and milk chocolate, Bourbon, light coffee, good roasty character, alcohol ever present and some would probably say..too much!"
2586,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.58,"Poured from a 8 oz. bottle into a tasting glass. 2008 vintage. Thanks a ton to Paulmpapp for bringing this out to our whale tasting. Appearance: Typical RIS look - ebony black color with a fairly thin tan head of creamy bubbles slowly fades to a collar and leaves a thin sheet of lace.  Smell: The aroma is very balanced and smooth. Some sweet bourbon, raisins, figs, and dark roasted malt are all subtle and blended so well together. Dark chocolate and a bit of espresso round out the nose. Taste: The flavor is pretty much exactly what I want out of a barrel aged imperial stout. Smooth, sweet bourbon comes in first and slowly lets in the fig, raisin, cherry, and roasted malt blend beautifully together. Some dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, and light espresso notes are in the background. The finish has a bit more bourbon and finishes fairly clean. Mouthfeel: The carbonation is smooth, with just enough crispness to excite the tongue along with the bourbon. The body is on the fuller side of medium and consistent all the way through. Slightly sticky on the lips. Overall: Clearly, this is one of the best imperial stouts I have had. No individual flavor really stands out, but the flavors in concert work so well together."
2587,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.87,"Unbelievable feel on that. Booze is well hidden under layers of oak, leather, toffee and burnt caramel. Really fantastic blending that doesn’t over do it"
2588,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.61,"750ml bottle served in a Mort Subite chalice. Bottle date 25/04/2011 A: First of all, beautiful bottle art. Corked 750ml bottle. Pours a dark rose color forming a medium but very fizzy and noisy big bubbled head leaving practically no lacings in the glass S: Very fruity. Strong notes of cherry juice and apple vinegar. Funky and sour. A bit metallic. Light notes of sweet malts. A bit earthy. Leather. Earthy yeasts T: Slight sweet upfront. Becoming suddenly quite dry and funky. Strong notes of apple vinegar, and cherry juice. Metallic. A bit earthy in the end M: Very light and watery body. Medium carbonation. Sour and fruity aftertaste O: Excellent drinkability. State of art Lambic beer"
2589,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.31,"2018 release (orange wax). A: Pours absolutely jet black with a thin cap of dark brown head. A couple streaks of lacing and pretty good retention for something this big. S: Rich dark chocolate bar, dark dried fruit, sweet vanilla bean ice cream, light oak char and whiskey. A bit of an alcohol burn on the nose.  T: Hot ethanol, dark chocolate, oak, light vanilla and whiskey, and a bit of red cherry with the associated tartness. The cherry and a powdery cocoa lingers on the (very long) finish.  M: Thick, motor oil consistency cut by medium carbonation. Moderate alcohol heat and burn. O: A big, bruising imperial stout. Interesting fruit notes and complexity. The heat and light barrel treatment knocks this down below top tier BA stouts. This is decidedly less good than much easier to acquire BA stouts like BCBS or BT."
2590,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.33,Pours deep brown almost black with two fingers of rocky tan head. 
2591,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.77,"This one pours a dark-ish black color, with a small head, and a small amount of lacing. This smells like sweet fruity coffee, with some milk chocolate, bourbon, slight toasted oak, etc. This is absolutely delicious. It's so creamily delicious, with vanilla, raisins, chocolatey coffee, caramel, sweet bourbon. The coffee is obviously a star here, but it's also just so delightfully chocolate-forward as well.  The mouthfeel on this great, thick, but also velvety and silky, with a soft and lower level of carbonation. Nobody in the United States, and honestly the world, is making beer as good as this."
2592,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.99,"look: dark orange with dense and persistent white foam smell: honeydew, peach, apricot, pineapple, so fresh and so intense taste: fresh honeydew and peach mango juice!!! feel: no abv, super balanced, medium+ body, creamy, soft, very nice bitter sweat aftertaste,  overall: perfecto! it's unbelievable that you can brew a beer this good, really."
2593,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.98,L- A rich midnight black color with a hazelnut head
2594,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.5,Poured from a bottle on 12-5-19. Coffee is more prevalent in the aroma while mocha is more up front in taste. This is above average in thickness and quite tasty.
2595,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.25,"I'm not the biggest fan of IPAs, but living near-ish to the Russian River brewery and experiencing the hype every year, I just had to go to their location in Windsor with a couple friends to try this back in February (gotta love pre-pandemic times). Got it on-tap while there, as well as in bottled form for later. Color was slightly cloudy but mostly clear, and it poured a very small head. I've had Pliny the Elder so I expected something along those lines, but it was much stronger and bolder than that. Very prominent hop taste and smell, as expected, but it wasn't especially bitter for such a hoppy beer, and the main notes I got were pine and citrus. It was incredibly crisp, and the flavor is very strong – each sip is meant to be savored, so you definitely won't just go through a pint of this.  I wasn't sure what to expect since I don't love IPAs, but I definitely could appreciate this one. Sure enough, the IPA-loving friend I was with absolutely adored it, while the other, who doesn't really drink IPAs, didn't especially like it. I get why the hype around it exists, and if you have a chance, it's worth it."
2596,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.6,"Much thanks to a good friend for sharing his bottle with me a few weeks ago. Enjoyed out of a green 375 mL bottle but I was not able to catch the bottling date (if there was one). Poured into a small Belgian-style tulip glass. Appearance (4.5) - Pours a hazy golden color that reminds me of the color of an egg yolk, but with more notes of orange and amber going on than what you'd expect. The head is about a finger at most and a fairly stark/snow white in color. It doesn't last long before fading to a ringlet around the edges of the glass and just a faint swirl of foam across the surface of the liquid. Smell (4.5) - There are a few key elements present which all combine quite nicely. Of course, there is a fantastic lactic acidity that makes my tastebuds pucker slightly in anticipation before ever taking a sip. But alongside that, the vinous characteristics of white wine and oak, with even perhaps a hint of vanilla. And finally, there is a subtle hint of white grape tartness that is different in nature from the bacteria-based sourness that is clearly present. It adds a depth to the sourness that might not be there without the fruit. I can't wait to dive into this and drink it. Taste (4.75) - The flavor does not disappoint, with all of the elements that presented themselves in the aroma pushing through in equal parts. Woody, musty oak and lactic sourness leads the way, inducing a nice satisfying pucker and refreshing tartness. As with the smell, the inclusion of the wine grapes gives a bit of juicy sourness that balances nicely alongside some funky, yogurt-like characteristic. The finish is where the chardonnay comes through, with crisp granny smith apple and white grape lingering on the palate. Mouthfeel (4.5) - Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated, with a lingering dry finish that entices the next sip. Overall (4.5), a fabulous beer, and my first in the Biere Brut style, although I can't imagine that this take could be considered typical. It's amazing to me just how sourness as a flavor profile can screw with one's perception of ABV level in a beer. This one certainly didn't give away it's 10% abv, and I've had other sour beers that were bursting with flavor but only had 3-4% abv. I would gladly drink this often if it was easier to get. A fabulous and unique offering from Side Project."
2597,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,3.84,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 13.7%. Pitch black colour, small brown head. Aroma of bourbon and molasses, hints of fusel alcohols, also notes of oak, chocolate, coconut and vanilla. Warming mouthfeel, very moderate carbonation. Sweet flavour, with the same elements as the aroma, the bourbon notes are very distinct. Low bitterness."
2598,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.56,"Bottle, blend 3, purchased at The Tin Bucket. A clear copper with a dense, white head with good retention and minimal lacing, this looks solid. The nose is pretty excellent. Insanely funky with preserved lemon, earth, mushroom, petrichor, light honey, floral orange blossoms, grapefruit pith. The dry, dusty, mineraly funk is just awesome. Dried mushroom for days. Delicate elderflower funk notes are present. The palate opens tart and lactic, a blend of earthy and mushroomy funk, complementing the sourness quite well. The sourness is reserved, not only for the style, but also given the age and the fact that this is an older de Garde. Remarkably well balanced, there are undercurrents of peach and pear. The funk on the palate is just fantastic, with layers of earth, leather, mushroom, cobwebs and must, and yes, some horseblanket as well. Drying, tart on the finish with a moderate carbonation, flavors of earth and mushroom linger. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the funk. Truly old world like."
2599,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.55,"Canned 7/8/20 “Your times is near, the mission’s clear” stamped on the bottom We’ve finally arrived here, my last new beer in the mixed case. It’s been a great time so far, and I don’t doubt that this last one will be incredible too Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of dark brown head that quickly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing The nose here is huge and sweet, tons of maple, maybe more than I’ve detected in a beer ever. The coffee is rich and roasty and the chocolate is incredibly sweet. Undertones of vanilla and caramel round things out On the front end, I get a decent amount of drip coffee and smooth maple syrup. Things bitter up mid palate but nothing too crazy, just a touch more roast. The aftertaste is long and brings bittersweet dark chocolate and even more maple syrup A full body with very mild carbonation leads to a smooth drinking experience. Finishes sticky but it works out here Wow, I’m continually impressed by the beers these guys and gals put out. This wasn’t a maple bomb, but it was still extremely prevalent throughout. I can not wait to try more beers from them"
2600,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.37,L-Nice amber red color with minimal head
2601,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,3.9,"Appearance - The beer poured a murky deep black color with a dark tan head. Smell - The beer smelled like peanuts covered in dark chocolate. The chocolate largely dominated.  Taste - So I was not really in the mood to risk anaphylactic shock tonight, so I deferred. The chocolate profile was very smooth with roasted peanuts. The profile did not lend it self to peanut butter. The aftertaste was very sweet, clearly signifying that this is a desert stout.  Mouthfeel - The field was smooth and silky, almost to the point of being velvety. Overall - Still, there was some thing about this one that I could not enjoy. Namely, a food allergy and the cost of an EpiPen kept me from enjoying it."
2602,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.42,"Amber hued with purple highlights. There’s a fingernail of white tinged with purple around the rim and covering half of the top. The aroma is of tart brettanomyces and blackberries. I’m tasting plenty of blackberries and brettanomyces, which seems to blend fantastically. The mouth is moderately carbonated and dry."
2603,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.47,"A 12.7 fl. oz. bottle, 2016 vintage, poured into a snifter glass. Appearance: Dark dark brown to black in colour with a thin beige head that disappeared almost immediately while leaving some sparse spotty lacing. Aroma: Mexican hot chocolate, light roast, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, chili and wood, with maybe even some light nuttiness. Taste: Bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, cocoa, cinnamon, chili, raisin, coconut, vanilla, almond and oak, while a touch herbal. Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderate to full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall: Good balance between the barrel, booze and spices. It drinks smooth and is a great sipper. However, I do think that I prefer the unbarreled aged version just that little bit more. Still a must buy though."
2604,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.56,**REVIEW NUMBER 900**
2605,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,3.71,"Pale salmon-amber with almost no head that builds, resulting in a thin ring around the edge. Not intending to start this off exactly like another review a few lines down, but this b2 FdF is way too sour. It's almost vinegary. An acetic, blackened oak overpowers the seedy raspberry, which is not as present as I'd expected. The finely carbonated medium body has also got a lemon juice sting to the dry finish.  Definitely a huge disappointment, particularly considering it's position on the Top 250."
2606,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.59,"Glad to tick this beer off my list.  Little to no carbonation. Nice nose of sticky pudding, dates and some alcohol. Tastes delicious, sweet caramel finish. The lack of any carb lends to a fairly thin mouthfeel but was still silky smooth"
2607,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.67,"From howler (less than 2 weeks). Beautiful bright yellow-orange opaque/hazy appearance with a good bit of frothy foam upon aggressive pour. Mosaic tropical fruit notes all the way. This is different than S&S #4, and closer to S&S #8. Medium mouthfeel but the really impressive part is how clean this beer is. Just very well done."
2608,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.63,500mL bottle into a snifter
2609,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.36,"[From Notes | Consumed 8/13/17] @ Trillium (Canton) Glowing cloudy orange color with minimal head. Aroma is thick with fruity hop dankness...ripe passion fruit, fresh peaches, pineapple juice, and nectarines. Heavy fruity hop flavors, Galaxy bringing deep juicy apricot, passion fruit, and tangerine. The underlying spicy, oily pine sap and herb dankness helps cut through the fructose. Fullish, creamy, fluffy feel with a dry finish. Big juicy awesomeness."
2610,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.5,"Huge thanks to Ryan for this can!  Pint can - canned in mid-November - poured into an Spiegelau IPA glass at 42°F. Pours a very attractive golden amber-honey hue - just a touch foggy, with a creamy, dense, two-finger eggshell white head with remarkable retention, leaving a thick sticky collar as it recedes.  Nose: Right there. It smells exactly like a heavily Citra-hopped West Coast double IPA. The malt base is surprisingly pale, with a lovely lightly toasty grain profile, with some sweet, bready crystal malt notes. Citra notes just explode with ripe tangerine, grapefruit, drippy pear, meyer lemon, candied pineapple, mango juice, fresh grass, pine sap, and actual fruit. Like that fruit skin smell you get in the produce aisle. It smells like produce aisle. So fresh and bright.  Palate: I try to be objective as possible, but sometimes, you take that first sip, and a beer just rocks your world. This is that, for me. The beer greets the palate with this simultaneous punch of perfect malt sweetness, grainy pale malt, mineral water zing, and a big explosion of Citra hops. Lemon zest, grapefruit pulp, Satsuma mandarin and tangerine, and even some key lime zest. There's some wisps of pineapple, mango, and passionfruit, but,it isn't thw tropical cocktail that the nose is. This is a bowl of citrus. There's this raw, green, leafy hop character that I usually only find in Nelson, and that obliterates the malty backbone, reducing it to pale grain. Some resinous Ponderosa pine sap, pithy grapefruit, and leafy green hops set a dry, resinous, moderately bitter tone to the finish which lingers for ages, eventually coming across as pure hop cone.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is medium-full in body. It has a sturdy backbone, but it doesn't overtake the beer, and it remains fully drinkable, and even quite crisp. You could drink this on a hot summer day and not feel like you're choking back a big beer. Very minimal malt stickiness, and a nice oily resinous hop cling that just adheres to the palate. Effervescence is so beautifully lively and zippy. Fully dry finish.  Overall: I hate that I'm doing this, but this ia a 4.5 across the board. I almost never review a beer that gets the same score for every category, but I can't honestly rate this any other way. This is a truly unique and incredible West Coast DIPA. It's saturated with intense citrus on the nose, with a huge punch of Citra flavour balanced by a perfect malt base, beautiful minerality, the prime level of bitterness, AND it's refreshing? Come on, what more can you want from this? What a gem. It's beers like this that make me excited about IPAs. Seek this out."
2611,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,5.0,"Drinking this tonight at a share with my husband and his two friends. I told them that they had to get this for me a while back and they finally came through, bout time!"
2612,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.73,"Usual black color for a stout, but the thick dark tan head and the clumpy lace made for a treat in the appearance department. Aroma was very nice as well, well integrated bourbon notes with soft malt roasting, chocolate/chocolate malt. Pair that with a mild oak and leather in the aroma, a very nice beer already. Taste, wow, beautiful, hides the alcohol well, the bourbon barrel like notes don't dominate, nothing dominates, is extremely easy to drink, especially for the heft of the alcohol. A mild smooth sweetness, almost honey like along with faint vanilla. Mouthfeel not overly thick, allows every component of the beer to come out oh so nicely. One of the more rare things for a barrel aged stout to do is allow for a caramel smoothness to help out, and this one does just that. Its not all about being the biggest and most abrasive peeps!  One of the best bal stouts in the world. Thanks to jh1982, dsgolovin & largadeer for putting together a combo of beers outside of Triple Rock for me and the ladyfriend to join in sampling, best beers of the weekend (well actually 2012 so far)."
2613,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.65,"most recent batch (didn't note the date) drank on 3/4/2017 L-not overly thick, deep dark brownish black, tan head S/T-BOOM! just fantastic combination of heavy oak, bourbon and milk chocolate, with some additional sweetness coming through from the honey and a hint of vanilla too and the coffee is subdued. Boy this is glorious F-drinkable for sure. no booze Overall-the smell and taste explain it all. Glad I have another one of these as this was just fantastic. Definitely underrated and I will seek out more of this."
2614,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.25,"2020 vintage; consumed on 9/18/21 Pours an inky black body topped with over two fingers of fluffy, khaki-colored foam; decent head retention leaves paper-thin islands of cap, large, frothy collar, minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass. Aroma brings a soft touch of molasses upfront, carrying soft caramel creams into a steadily building oaky vanilla and eventually culminating with robust waves of raw cacao meeting oaky bourbon. Taste opens with bittersweet cocoa tinged with toasted oak barrel and residual bourbon characteristics, though the malt is central, peaking over the mid-palate with the purest, flaky roast sensations cooly revealing layer upon layer of oily, raw cacao, burnt almond, and evocative dark chocolate. Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body, silkily textured and, in tune with a soft, prickly carbonation, sporting mild gritty accents into the mid-palate; suggestions of distant char and balanced booziness enhance over the back end, eventually leveling out to a dry roast along the palate's finish. Chocolate, malted chocolate, dragged from the most evocative expanses of its malt profile and kissed with a softly integrated bourbon implicating a doting heat to further accentuate the already resonant roast; a classic sipper, its quintessence on full display."
2615,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,3.79,"16oz can received as a gift from a friend. Purchased directly from the brewery. Canned on 9/30/2020 with ""I Want Haze You Want Haze We All Want Haze"" stamped on the bottom, so this is almost 3 months old. Look: Pours a quite hazy yellowish orange color. Looks kind of like super unfiltered peach-pineapple-mango juice. Small head with some lacing. Smell: Very pungent initially. A lot of over-fermented tropical fruit aroma including orange, mango, guava, dried papaya, and pineapple along with a significant green and dank finishing note. A bit of sharp, vegetal onion also. The nose is very sharp, before tasting the beer I am not sure how much I like it on its own. A more pleasant pink grapefruit aroma comes through later on, along with some spice. Taste: Interesting in that this is bitter up front (which you don't usually get with these NEIPAs), followed by sweetness and tropical fruit and lots of citrus rind, and then more bitterness on the finish. Something tastes a bit off about this beer to me, and I can't really place it. It could be because it's not the freshest (almost 3 months old), or it could just be that it's not my taste. Probably the biggest positive about this beer is that the 8.2% ABV is pretty well hidden. Feel: Nice mouthfeel. Soft and pillowy. Appropriately carbonated. Overall: My third Tree House beer. I wish that this beer was more complex - this could be due to the age. I look forward to being able to re-review this one when I can enjoy a fresher offering. The flavor of this beer has grown on my since I tasted it initially, but it still seems a bit lacking to me. Well-made for sure, but again I think that it ideally needs to be enjoyed fresher."
2616,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.66,"Nice orange body with a creamy head. Aroma is orange, mango, pineapple, papaya, passionfruit. An aroma explosion. Taste matches with the aroma. Very juicy. Good piney bitterness. Gentle malt flavor in the background provides a nice backdrop for the beer. Creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well concealed. Good body for an IPA. I usually have trouble taking down higher abv beers but this one is so well blended it's hard to tell I am drinking anything but heaven. A great beer."
2617,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.56,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a pleasant vanilla and bourbon. Taste is also a nice blend of vanilla and bourbon.
2618,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.99,"2019 draft and bottle. I didn't think this beer could possibly live up to the hype after the long wait to try it, but got-damn this beer is the real McCoy. Huge coffee nose, reminds me of walking into a (great) coffee shop. Chocolate, bourbon, subtle maple hiding in the background. Taste is simply perfection. Phenomenal coffee flavors, chocolate, bourbon, and a perfect maple finish. incredibly well balanced between coffee and maple. Thick, oily mouthfeel more on par with Sr-71 than assassin. What can I say, its phenomenal. Leaves you wanting more and more, but unfortunately not many oz's to go around."
2619,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.16,"375 ml 2005. Maybe it was a little long in the tooth. Funk and apple juciy on the nose, not that sour but smooth. Still terrific mouthfeel. Had side by side with Whalezblood by Crooked stave and I thought that had more sourness and complexity. This was like an old funky cider that was just a little tart."
2620,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.44,"Look – A dark ruby red color with a surprising amount of sediment. Nice head and good lacing. Smell – Has a very nice Raspberry scent. It's not overly sour (I dislike too much sourness in wild ales). Taste – Raspberry flavor with just a touch of sour. It's a really great lambic Feel – It's a perfectly carbonated lambic that goes down real easy. Maybe just a bit dry. Overall – Definitely one of the better lambics I've had. My favorite is still the Lindeman's, as I really like the sweetness in that one. But this is very nice."
2621,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.29,"A 1 pint can, canned on 5th May 2020. Poured into a Holy Mountain tulip glass. Appearance: A hazy yellowish orange colour with a one finger white head that had excellent retention and left lots of nice lacing. Aroma: Citrus rind and zest, lime, with notes of passionfruit, mango, pineapple and orange. Taste: Lightly sweet, mango, papaya, melon, orange, light bitterness, citrus rind, dank, with notes of mandarin zest. Mouthfeel: Smooth, crushable, medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall: Nice Citra beer with lots of fruit in the aroma and flavour, and a good balance between sweet and bitter."
2622,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.18,"Had this during the New England trip October 2019. Was a little leery, the sip of sunshine I had years before was vastly overrated. But every other beer I had from Lawson's had been awesome.  Pours a yellow color with a minority amount of light orange to it, 1/3"" white head. I dig the CTZ/Citra combo for the aroma. Orange infused weed. Leans more on the Citra, but CTZ is so damn tough it can stand out even when used sparingly compared to other hops.  Taste is real nice, that CTZ bitterness but with a green vibe beyond the normal pine bittering hop, combined with Citra bringing that orange and tangerine fruitiness to the taste profile. Mouth feel helped along by a small amount of flaked oats that doesn't cause a haze trub bomb on the appearance scale. Good use of carapils and corn sugar/syrup as well for a drier body. You really get the best of both ipa worlds with this beer. Hides the alcohol so well you can crush these like a session ipa if you don't regulate yourself. Top notch."
2623,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.75,16 oz. Cup (From On-Tap/Beer To Go)
2624,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.1,"Prairie Apple Brandy Barrel Noir, 12% ABV. Pours black with the typical Prairie ring of brown bubbles. Nose is apple brandy, taste follows and as it reaches 55 degrees F the chocolate shows up. Excellent mouthfeel, though a touch watery, still overall outstanding. I'd advise just drinking this at room temperature."
2625,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,5.0,"I was extremely lucky to have been there to get this as an onsite pour. I am thankful. It was excellent. As usual, Hill Farmstead is the standard by which all breweries must measure themselves."
2626,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.74,Look - black thick and a nice tan rimming almost no head. Fantastic skimming
2627,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.54,"Bottle from Etre Gourmet, served at home in a snifter glass."
2628,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.69,"Pours a deep golden hazy with good white head retention. Three's a menthol aroma. It's bubblegummy, chewy mouthfeel, some tangy citrus that turns into peanut. That galaxy note really is what robs this of being a really solid beer. It's very dry too so it leans heavily on its dankness. I do think it would benefit from a little more sugar to bring out the tropical hop character, but there's nothing that can save you from bad Galaxy hops."
2629,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.85,"King jjjulius (I’ve had multiple batches but the review is for the one canned 6/08/21) Look: Pours golden orange. There are almost multiple different golds and yellows depending on where in the glass you look (could just be the lighting). Leaves amazing glass lacing. This beer glows.  Smell: There’s a brand of OJ (can’t remember which) that makes a OJ/Mango/Peach/Pineapple juice blend. This smells exactly like that. Orange and grapefruit peel, mangos, mango sorbet, peaches, pineapple, juicy fruit….you get the idea  Taste: this batch was unique in how juicy fruit/candied orange it was up front. It’s actually crazy how much it tastes like juicy fruit. You then get the tropical fruits that were on the nose. Very minor green bitterness on the backend..just enough to dry things out. It was a just a tad watery on the finish oddly enough.  Feel: Very creamy as is the case with most TH big beers.  Overall: this is definitely one of the best IPAs out there. I got it on a road trip while hitting 9 different NE breweries (Hill Farmstead, Fox Farm, OH, etc), and there weren’t any IPAs better than it. However there are so many great IPAs out there that I wouldn’t necessarily go out of my way to get it. The difference between this and other great IPAs are maybe 5-10% at best."
2630,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.84,Had this on draft at the 2017 San Diego Beer Week at the brewery. BBA Speedway stout has a great roasty malt flavor with a great amount of bourbon flavor.
2631,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.64,"2018 vintage. Bottle poured into snifter. Pours black with a half inch medium brown head. Nose: vanilla and coffee dominate. Bourbon barrel and maple come in towards the end. Bourbon is pretty subtle. Taste: phenomenal. Follows the nose mostly - coffee and chocolate lead followed closely by maple. Vanilla starts to take over as it warms, and towards the end it’s really dominated by vanilla and maple. Bourbon barrel is fairly subtle and drifts in and out. Finishes semi sweet with more maple and vanilla. Feel: full-bodied, smooth, medium-low carbonation."
2632,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.4,"Pours an opaque yellow with a finger of white head. Head retention is good. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, mango, oranges and a touch of spicy yeast at the back. Flavor profile is tangerine, mango, papaya, passionfruit and spicy yeast. It opens up lightly sweet and finishes lightly zesty for a dynamically shaped experience. Mouth feel is soft and fuzzy, like a cozy, warm sweater. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, sweet and zesty for a flavorful little experience pop.  Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 12oz can. Reviewed on Beers by BeerAdvocate."
2633,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.25,"On tap in Vermont. I do not remember where. Three Penny? Probably. The pour is that of an NEIPA: Hazy, thick, and yellow. The aroma is aggressively fruity and tropical. Nice, but, again, nothing too exceptional for the style. Flavor is, again, nice. Well balanced. The fruitiness is pretty extreme but still well-rounded."
2634,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.69,"Served in a tulip glass from a vintage 2017 bottle.  Appearance: very dark amber coming off with an off white head.  Smell: heavy whiskey feel which disintegrates into your nostrils and stick with you for a while.  Taste: super complex consisting of toffee, Honey, whiskey and a light dose of yeast.  Mouth: suave carbonation but extremely sticky with a full body, the taste just lingers with you at the place in the glass down.  Overall: I picked this up probably a year-and-a-half ago and I cannot remember where but it is an absolute must grab if you ever see it on a shelf. Salud!"
2635,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.56,2019....strong coffee scent. Not overly bitter for a coffee stout. Coffee flavor is exceptional. Medium feel with a thin coat on the glass. This was well done.
2636,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.15,"2016 Vintage - Drank 02/24/21 Smell -pleasant with notes of tobacco and chocolate Taste - The tobacco over powers this one in the beginning. And then as it warms, the peppers take over. Very unique taste, and I think it’s the brandy barrel influence. Feel - thin, and I expected more Overall - for being the #4 overall beer on BA, I expected more, much more. The feel was thin, and notes of pepper overpowered this. Yet it was not completely unenjoyable, just not even close to the 4th best beer in the world. Regardless, glad I gut to try it as it’s always nice to see what the hype is about. This one just didn’t live up to it"

2647,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,5.0,"7 May 2020 - Beer #88 - BA Top 250 Alert! Corona Day #56 Acquired via trade Appearance: 5 - a glowing apricot orange. Beautiful white head still maintaining a strong presence after several minutes. Nose: 5 - SOUR! Remember when classic saisons weren't sour? I recall that actually being a thing. This one will be super sour. Apricot in there too. Taste: 5 - ok, so it's not insanely sour, but the apricot certainly comes to the fore. And that barnyard funk they're always talking about? Really shines on the back end. Mouth: 5 - oh lordy! I'm amazed at how thick this is. Like it takes a couple swallows to get it all down. Overall: 5 - this is a real standout. Wow!"

2649,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.84,"What complexity! On the dryer side, despite the rich tropical elements. In a sense, more restrained, but so tightly woven! Packed with flavors and layers that listing them would be silly. Just an incredible beer with perfect craftsmanship."
2650,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.4,A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high dark tan head that has excellent retention properties and hardly died down.
2651,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.58,"Pours a hazy golden with a thick, creamy white head and has good lacing. The aroma is very peachy and orangey with a subtle spice. The malt aroma is bready with a honey-like quality. As for the taste, it is very juicy, overripe peach, sweet citrus, and tropical fruit with a very smooth bitterness. The malt does a nice job in a supporting role with round, warm bready flavors and some sweetness. The beer has a very lush, creamy body, a nice prickly carbonation, and a moderately dry finish. Overall, this is a truly stellar NEIPA. Huge juicy flavor and aroma, creamy dreamy body, and a very restrained bitterness. Tree House is really one of the best in the business."

2654,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.11,"This beer definitely has apricot in it. The smell is there and the taste is there along with some punch you in the face sourness. This beer is very acidic and funky and plays well with the fruit. Did a side by side with Map of the Sun and de Garde's Imperial Apricot and this came in 2nd to DG, Map came in a distant 3rd."
2655,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.42,"Very dense hazy pour of pulpy orange juice hues. Rich and juicy tropical fruit aromas that rank with the best Other Half has to offer. Ripe melon, pulpy guava, pineapple and mango. The rich taste carries those hints and adds creamsicle and raw honey notes. This is some mouthful with all that fruit but you do get a hint of the oat grain that OH frequently employs. The Mosaic is just ever so noticeable but I wish it was a little more front and center. Great mouthfeel on this one."
2656,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.1,"Cloudy, vibrant light orange with a finger-and-a-half of yellowed head. Lasts a good while and leaves rings of lacing. Strong clementine-like citrus with some cream and floral passionfruit in the nose. Orange and white wine up front in the taste, followed by a bitter, slightly nutty, slightly grassy finish. Creamy, medium bodied feel with a small burst of carbonation. Great citrus and a nice bitterness in this one."
2657,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.25,"Bottled 11/2/16; drank 12/5/16 @ the Palace.  Semi-opaque dull orange appearance.  A rough pour yielded a huge off-white head; frothy lace.  Sweet orange citrus, grapefruit & cane sugar notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Orange citrus & cane sugar flavors up front; mild grapefruit bite on the finish. No booze heat.  A little too sweet, but overall an excellent DIPA!"

2659,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,3.58,"2021 Review: Appearance: Pours a clear, deep orange color with a large sticky white head. SRM of 15. (4.00) Aroma: Only moderate aromas upfront of resinous mandarin orange, slight tropical citrus/melon, with some dank berry aromas before a deep layer of honey malt comes forth. Slight pine. (3.50) Flavor: Hits with a wave of malts. In the middle, some candied orange, tropical fruit, dank berries, pine on the tongue. In the end it finishes with a wave of candied malts and honey. There's a bitterness presence here, but outmasked by the honey/malt sweetness.  Feel: Heavier bodied upfront. Only moderate carbonation. Hides the alcohol well within the malts. A rather dank and strong pine bitterness. Don't be fooled, it finishes heavy, sticky, and sweet, which isn't particularly pleasant.  Compared to Hop Valley Cryo Stash IPA 4/29/21: Pours a darker color with a larger head. Milder aromas. Light to moderate aromas of resinous mandarin orange. More caramel malt, honey, dank berry, and pine.  Overall: Not unlike my 2020 review, this one has a large malt body upfront, some mandarin orange and tropical, dank berry notes in the middle, before it's all cleaned off by a dank pine and strong honey/caramel sweetness. For some this beer is a reminder of home. Maybe a barleywine. For others, it's just an over-done IPA. If this beer was a pickup truck, it would be an F-150 excessively jacked up 8 feet with oversized tires. This beer can be made, not sure if it needs to be. "

2662,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.16,"L: Clear bold burgundy color with a one finger breath lace that quickly dissipates to only a thin line of lace that clings to the sides of class. S: Mild sour funk with hints of sour cherry, oak, bananas, and raisins.  T: Funky sour cherries tempered by the taste of Pinot Noir and oak. The longer it airs the milder and sweeter it gets.  F: Mild tartness that leaves your mouth watering for more. O: In a nutshell, a Belgium brown ale with the taste of a wild ale, but the wild ale is tempered and it’s complexity enhanced with the aging in the wine barrels. Brilliant!"
2663,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.8,"Bottled on 08/16/17 - poured into Wander coliff glass Absolutely one of the best beers I've had, hands down, and the best of the year for me. Trumps the bourbon paradise from a couple days ago as my best beer of the year. Looks black on the pour with a small mocha head. It dissipates quickly, but smell still is in full force. Fudge and vanilla. Chipotle roasted almonds pops off first. The taste has a bit of Bourbon barrel and smoked peppers. The pepper fades and the vanilla and chocolate dominates the taste. It all melds with the barrel well. Every sip better than the next. The warmer this gets, the hotter this beer gets. Odd complexity, but it's warily welcome as the shift change comes into play. Don't think anything is going to beat this for the rest of the year."
2664,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.36,"A- Thick 375ml bottle pours into an 8oz tasting glass with a deep black body and a one finger cocoa tan head. The head has a puffy texture and dies down somewhat quickly to a small ring at the edges. Lacing spotty and somewhat rare. S- Bourbon barrel comes on strong right away but once you dig a bit deeper the beer opens up wonderfully with the malts and the coffee. Chocolate comes to mind right off the bat and that is joined by some caramel from the malts that creates a nice brownie feel. Some nice peppery Bourbon whiskey that gives a bit of dark fruit feel. Suggests booze but that balances with everything else nicely. A lot of vanilla throughout this. Each element comes together in harmony. T- The barrel is a bit stronger here than in the aroma as far as the overall balance goes but good thing it is a really great barrel flavor. The whiskey, vanilla and softened oak burst onto the palate followed by rich chocolate, toasted nuts, charred barley, cocoa powder and dark roast coffee notes. A subtle smoky tobacco thing happening but secondary to the malts and barrel. Great balance of booze, sweetness and bitterness. MF- Medium bodied overall with a moderately low level of carbonation. The mouthfeel isn't bad but it does come off a bit more oily and slick from the high ABV and it loses some of the hefty creaminess. Ends slightly warm. I guess I have learned to trust Jackie O's with barrel aged brews over the years. A large dose of Bourbon barrel leads things off with coffee, roast grains, chocolate and vanilla notes also very strong."
2665,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.34,"The beer is a black color with a small, quickly disappearing tan head."
2666,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.13,"Dark-stained chestnut with a finger of mocha head. Spotty, short-lived lacing. Big brownie chocolate and bourbon in the aroma. Hints of vanilla, cherry, wood and root beer. Nice depth of flavor: chocolate, roasted malts, gentian, root beer, vanilla, nuts, earthy hops and alcohol burn. Smooth, slick feel — a touch on the light side for the style — with plenty of carbonation. Plenty of barrel presence in this with a nice root beerish twist. Very enjoyable."
2667,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.44,"22 oz. bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip glass. Comes out a dirty brown color. From a distance it looks black as it pools up in the glass. Coffee with milk colored head with mostly small bubbles. It goes away pretty quickly, about as fast as a can of soda. Not much in the way of highlights or lacing. Ok looking beer, but looks arn't everything. Smell is really good. Molasses, brown sugar, leather, tobacco with some hints of vanilla, cinnamon and wood. One of those beers that if I could turn it into a scented candle, I'd totally burn it all the time. Taste is equally as excellent as the smell. Toffee/chocolate/chewy caramel candy flavors. Brown sugar, vanilla, wood and maybe even a touch of a dark red port wine. Gets better as it warms up. Mouthfeel is good, certainly full bodied. A nice long lingering flavor. Very light carbonation level. Very sweet leading to slightly acidic to a warning finish; slightly earthy. Very good drinkability it's a sipper, but I'm going to have no issues taking down this bomber. This is a great beer, I didn't think it was going to wow me at first, but it certainly impressed me. This aged pretty well for the last year as well. Nice job Olde Hickory and thanks a ton Paschel for the beer!"
2668,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.52,From growler (under 2 weeks). Bright yellow-orange completely opaque/hazy appearance with a good bit of frothy foam and carbonation upon aggressive pour. Very citrus and tropical aromaticity. Loads of citrus fruit flavors. Sweeter taste. Creamy mouthfeel and little bit of a different finish than your typical NE IPA (different from Tree House and Trillium). Hard to describe but it works well and balances the citrus fruitiness.
2669,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.24,"16oz can from Tavour. Hazy orange golden body with a silky off white head. Aroma is dusty hops, floral, pine, citrus.

2670,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.41,"2020 Vintage. L -- Probably the most intensely thick and inky beer I've encountered to date. 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals absolutely nothing, not even allowing light around the edge of the glass.

2672,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.55,"Crazy though I may be, I actually prefer the non-barrel-aged bottle of Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout over the barrel-aged bottle. This bottle, though not barrel-aged, is plenty rich and sweet enough - the chocolate to the nose and taste is thick and very pleasant, without any tangible heat from the ABV. It's quite pleasant without being too much in any particular regard, though it is tremendously sweet. I actually turned down pours of several other beers after drinking this one... my palate and my teeth just needed a break. So much sugar. The Angry Chair reputation is well-deserved. They're crafting some particularly devious diabetes beers down there."
2673,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.18,"Poured into a BL FO glass. Nose is caramel, toffee, vanilla, chocolate fudge, and coconut of course. All of these flavors coat the palate as well. Full and flavorful, with plenty of coconut still present. My main complaint is that the fudge component dominates too much; it has a heavy, gooey mouthfeel and flavor that impedes the barrel characteristics. Still a nice beer though."
2674,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.79,"This is suuuuuper sweet coconuts with some to spare. Thicc doesn’t begin to describe this, on the level of coconut vibes. Crazy and excellent and too much for diabetics!"
2675,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.31,"Bottle @ RateBeer Best 2016. A later pour from the bottle, so a little bit chunky, but fine with me. Intense apricot and just overall juicy fruity quality to both the aroma and flavor. Pleasant lemon and citric acidity here without being over the top. Notes of lime, grape skin, and oak to go along with all the apricot. Really nice."
2676,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.09,"This one was quite disappointing for me. I had expected a lot based on the extremely high ratings here on BA, and I love oatmeal stouts, but this one just didn’t quite deliver. 2019 edition printed on bottle. Pours a thicker black color with just a little tan head and very small amounts of lingering lacing. Smells of some medium roast coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, spices, a hint of bourbon. Taste follows the nose, but I was expecting more depth and balance and this just didn’t quite do it for me. Don’t get me wrong, it was solid, just not mind blowing. Smooth slightly sticky mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. I wished it were creamier and more licious. A good beer but I likely won’t try it again."

2681,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.51,"Rich dark brown with a thin finger of creamy-looking mocha head. Settles relatively quickly into a nice, lasting cap and wisp. Almost no lacing. Huge maple in the nose. Hints of coffee, vanilla, raisin and dough. The maple and molasses is very strong in the taste, but kept somewhat in check by nice French roast coffee. Maple, raisin, prune, vanilla and cola sweetness lingers in the aftertaste, but not in a cloying way. Like a delicious chocolate cordial. Super thick, smooth feel with a light carbonation fizz. I really like the raisin in this. It’s almost juicy. Adds some character beyond what, these days, could be a fairly normal maple-and-coffee flavor profile. This beer is all-around excellent."
2682,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.7,"One of the most dynamic taste experiences my mouth has ever encountered. The crack of the can unleashes a plethora of tropical notes and piny scents. It’s incredible and enough to fill the room. The taste profile mirrors the aromatic experience. It starts out in the tropics and then transitions to a dense pine forest. I mean I’m not kidding when I say this, it’s as if you crashed into an evergreen and you have to pick the needles out of your teeth. Finally, this beer smacks the back of your throat with an extremely intense hop bite that fads into a smooth finish begging you you to grab the glass and bring it to your lips once again. I can’t underestimate how lovely this beer is. It’s bold, it’s tasty and it’s an experience your mouth won’t soon forget."
2683,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.09,"Hadn't actually heard of this one before managing to grab myself a can. But this was a delight! Really, really solid east coast double. Worth seeking out if available in your area."
2684,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.6,"Pours a cloudy, but not opaque golden orange color. A lovely thick white frothy head forms on the beer, linger for a long moment, then slowly collapses leaving just a ring of foam along the outside of the top of the beer. Lots of sticky white lacing coats the glass as the head recedes and to a lesser extent as the beer is consumed.  Aroma has notes of overly ripe citrus, pineapple, pine, with a green hop note coming through on the nose. There is a light peach or nectarine character to this aroma coming through as well. Underlying that is a nice cracker malt backbone that peeps through the pungent hop notes. Taste follows the nose with notes of ripe citrus, peach, and pineapple. Green hop notes intermingle with some pine, dried vegetation with a light spiciness coming through. There isa pleasant bitterness to this that is there, but not unbalanced. There is a bready/biscuity malt backbone subtly underlying the hop flavors.  For a DIPA its alarmingly easy drinking. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, with a light oil slickness to it. Bright carbonation. Semi-dry finish. Overall this is absolutely delicious. A true gem of a DIPA."

2687,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,3.89,"Bottled 3/11/21. This is the perfect time for a summer spring winter beer. The description on the back of the bottle pretty much tells it all. It pours dark brown with a small tan head, much like the coffee types it emulates. Smell and taste are almost identical: black coffee and unsweetened chocolate. There is a bit of mild oat sweetness that I get on the nose, but not on the tongue. The chocolate is a bit more pronounced in the taste. There is a particular roasted quality in the aftertaste that I like. It's a cup of joe that makes you feel even better. It's very smooth, which may be attributed to the addition of oatmeal (I'm just reading BA's description of the style at this point). No alcohol heat either. I enjoy it, even if it is a bit on the bitter side. There just isn't anything that really grabs me."
2688,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.38,"8000th review! 8 ounce pour from a 24 ounce bottle; 2017 vintage bottling. Bottle #14819. Pours still, slightly hazy ruby reddish/orange/copper color. No head or lacing, but tons of alcohol legs on the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Increasing booze in the aromas, but not too overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light oak char bitterness, and barrel tannin/alcohol spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark fruits, cherry, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, brown bread/crust, licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; with a great malt/oak spiciness balance, and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering barrel tannin and spicy alcohol. Fairly full body; with a smooth, creamy/slick, and lightly syrupy/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Light-moderate increasing warmth of 28%, some lingering barrel booze after the finish; but not overwhelming. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged strong ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the enormous ABV. As expected this is like a cross between beer and all above mentioned spirits. Mind blowing amounts of complexity; and everything is perfectly integrated with all the different barrels. A highly amazing offering, and world class beer for what it was. A truly unique experience."
2689,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.4,"this is a killer beer, quite deserving of its highly regarded status, and a pretty righteous use of maple syrup, but i think i just like their sunday brunch better. i lose quite a bit of the coffee roasted bitterness here to the spiciness of the chilis and the cinnamon. i mean, there is amazing balance between all the added ingredients here, and you can surely appreciate each element on its own as well as appreciate its contribution to the whole, dont get me wrong, but i liked the simplicity of the coffee and the maple too. the cocoa adds a nice bittering low end along with the roasted malt, and i get a unique floral honey thing in here too, odd in such a huge and flavorful and dark beer, but there it is. the cinnamon is warming with the alcohol, and the maple makes this wintery and cozy. its not overdone, but its awfully flavorful, and probably as close to the line with adjuncts as i like to get most of the time. still really maple forward, but not as driven by it as the sunday brunch is. cool beer, powerfully flavored, neat balance though, and smooth and rich to drink on. these guys have blown me away in limited exposure, i need to find a way to get more of their beers in me! as good as any of the more well known beers made in this style..."
2690,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.53,"On tap at Trillium, my 2nd ever beer from them. Pours a hazy orange color, with a moderate and well retaining frothy head. Pretty much the same look as the DDH Sleeper Street I had earlier. The aroma displays juicy notes of tropical fruit, particularly, passion fruit, guava and mango. These are accompanied by citrus notes of grapefruit, orange and lemon. Herbal aromas evoke grass and mint.  Medium to full bodied with a mouthfeel that opens relatively smoothly, while the carbonation is moderate and on par for the style. Tropical notes of passion fruit, guava, and mango lend a softness and a juicy sweetness, less intense than the DDH Sleeper Street I had earlier. Also, the firm malt and wheat backbone contributed to the soft and doughy sweetness. However, as the citrusy flavors of grapefruit rind, orange pith, lemon and lime open up, their zesty nature adds balancing spice. Furthermore, the developing herbal hops flavors of pine and grass add both bitterness and a prickliness to the mouthfeel. The finish is long, dry and with a resiny hops burn that lingers in the palate. Tough to rate against the DDH Sleeper Street, nevertheless, I can say with confidence that both are world class and deserving of comparable scores."
2691,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.02,Nothing but solid goodness from Tree House. Citrus and tropical flavors are in balance. Nice hazy pour. Not very complex; just straight down the middle solid and enjoyable.
2692,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.6,"Canned 1.14.2020, opened 2.4.2020 “Do you ever ignore what you don’t understand?” Can poured into a snifter. Dark cola liquid with a one finger deep brown mousse like foam cap. Recedes to a solid brown ring after three minutes. Some thin lacings Fragrant on the pour. Maple cream, maple sugar candy. Dark roasts. Milk chocolate  Taste is maple cream, chocolate. Sweet, no bite, dark roast flavor  Fizzy carbonation sudsing Good beer"
2693,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,3.77,"Canned on 8/8/20 Pours a turbid, almost dense, dark bronze-orange body topped with over 2 fingers of thick, fluffy, white foam; great head retention yields a half-finger of creamy cap and moderate collar, along with a coating of soapy lacing covering the walls of the glass. Aroma opens with hits tropical puréed mango contrasted against more subdued, fresh apricot zest; waxy white grapefruit, passionfruit, and papaya rinds add further layers, while soft undertones of black pepper and pumpernickel bread fork more concretely over time and remain in the backdrop through the close. Taste profile is blunt with tropical saturation upfront, highlighting banana, mango, passionfruit, and papaya before shifting to a deeply grassy mid-palate; burnt toast lingers through the back end, saved slightly by a brilliant peach sorbet tone past the swallow. Mouthfeel shows a medium body with a minor carbonation encouraging a seamless silkiness along the palate; a subdued prickle develops quickly into the back end, while a mild hop acidity is dispersed throughout the finish and leveling out a grit enmeshed in a semi-oily, resinous texture. Though an excellent all-around foundation to a NEIPA and suggesting hints of balance alongside intense flavor combinations, this is the base beer Doppelganger simply undone by excess. For the standard Tree House tends to set, this brew is overdone and rather sloppy despite an inherent drinkability; a disorienting hop experience, and not in the best way."
2694,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.58,"Bottled 7/2/20 We've finally arrived. I've been lookin for this beer since near the beginning of my craft beer journey, and it's finally here. I know it's not as acclaimed as the likes of authentic Belgian lambics, but I've Allagash was one of the first breweries I started getting into, so I just had to have this Pours an opaque red/purple with 2 fingers of pink-tinted white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing Holy hell, for a fruited lambic where I usually expect a fair amount of sweetness, the nose here is straight up funky. I'm picking up on aromas of wet hay, leather, red raspberry, rich blackberry, lemon peel, white pepper, sharp oak, doughy malt, and a hint of vanilla The taste delivers upon the promises made by the aroma with hardly anything lost in translation, maybe just a bit more sweetness in this case. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart raspberry, tannic red wine, a hint of lime, and a soft wheat backbone to support the sourness. Speaking of sour, it is dialed up to 11 on the swallow, which brings notes of super tart lemon, wet hay, raspberry, sharp oak, and red wine vinegar with a long finish of lightly chewy malt A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a supper zippy and refreshing beer. Finishes mostly dry but coats the mouth and throat with the lingering sweetness Hot damn, this was an absolute treat. It's crazy when you're looking for something for so long and it actually turns out to be as good as you built it up in your head. Not quite as good as their Nancy (my 2nd best beer of all time) but incredible in its own right. Awesome work Allagash, as always"
2695,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.7,"Pours jet black with just a thin tan head. Smell had cinnamon,pepper,coffee,cocoa and vanilla/chocolate very nice . Taste has fresh roasted coffee that mixes beautifully with cinnamon and the ancho wow its superb. cocoa and cinnamon with roasted chocolate mix in. Mouth feel coffee and cocoa smooth cinnamon with the chilies so superb in the finish. This is the best coffee stout ive ever had."

2697,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.77,"Easily the best I've ever had from Side Project. It's fantastic, and the raspberries shine through perfectly. It also strikes a great balance between its tartness and its drinkability."
2698,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.39,"Pitch black and nearly opaque with dark chocolate brown edges and a two finger mocha head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Sporadic spotty lace left behind. Sweet, slightly boozy aroma with a very nice delicate bourbon barrel presence that's nicely integrated into the coffee/roasted malts of the base beer. Bourbon sweetness that's slightly spicy with subtle charred oak but not much toothpick. Really nice bourbon and gourmet coffee interplay along with silky vanilla bean and toasted coconut. Underneath, there's really nice gourmet coffee character along with some toast, oatmeal and dark chocolate. Luscious silky chocolate sweetness balancing out the barrel and roast. Very similar to the nose with an excellent bourbon barrel presence that's nicely integrated into the gourmet coffee, subtle roast and silky chocolate sweetness of the base beer. Slightly spicy and boozy but mostly smooth bourbon flavor along with toasted oak, faint char, coconut and vanilla bean. Barrel notes countered by deeply roasted gourmet coffee but not overly harsh, acrid or astringent. Slightly green peppery but overall excellent coffee flavor that doesn't get lost under the barrel notes. Luscious, silky chocolate dessert sweetness balances things out. Hints of bakers chocolate, gooey fudge and triple chocolate layer cake. Well balanced with complex barrel flavors excellently integrated into the robust roast, sweeter dark malt notes and intense coffee presence. Great beer."
2699,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.3,"Look: Dark cola brown with a thin line around the rim of a head. No activity.  Smell: Heavy and cloying on the nose. Sweet. Let’s of dark chocolate, coconut, bourbon, alcohol, a hint of cinnamon, condensed milk, and more chocolate.  Taste: Much like the nose. Heavy on the palate. Milk chocolate, dates, honey, cola, coconut, a kiss of cinnamon, big smooth bourbon, and a big if smooth alcohol.  Feel: Oily and massive on the palate. One of the biggest beers I have ever had. High alcohol. Very sweet.  Overall: An absolutely ridiculous beer. Something akin to a port. Fun and decadent. Not something I could drink more then once a year."
2700,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.63,"Batch 1: Bright gold pour, light haze, smaller head that fizzles out fast. amazing balance in the aroma and taste here. Slightly under-ripe yellow plum, rustic notes, wheat, barnyard funk, lemon notes, lighter oak notes, light vanilla sweetness, light yogurt lactic sourness. Nothing here exhausts the palate - no one component completely takes over this beer. Lighter body, carbonation is spot on."
2701,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.72,Tan head. Black in color. The nose is perfect. Almond joy bar. Amazing. Taste is lots of coconut and chocolate with an almond flabor. Big warming bourbon and vanilla. Amazing. Full bodied and clean. Very impressed with this one! Wow.
2702,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.58,"super super sweet, more sweet decadent barrel notes (big vanilla, toffee, caramel, chocolate) come through than actually bourbon character. molasses and some mellow dark fruits and spice note, hint of oak and mellow bourbon. not much boozyness at all for the abv. medium-full mouthfeel, some chewy texture."
2703,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.04,"2014 Bottle poured into plastic dixie cup. A: Murky red body with a pink colored frothy head that settles quickly. S: Lots of raspberry, a little vinegar and some wheat. T: Fairly muted flavors with a little of the berry in the finish and fairly sour. O: The nose on this beer was sublime, but the flavor was lacking I think the bottle may have been a little too old so do not sit on this beer."
2704,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.11,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like roasted malt, spicy oak, dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, and vanilla. This is definitely old school in execution - there's lots of roast and spice here. There's a big barrel character - oak char, vanilla, spicy bourbon - it feels like something that was in barrels a decently long time. There's some dark fruit and lots of dark chocolate, along with a cigar-like bitterness. This is medium bodied, not quite as thin as most Central Waters, with a *slightly* prickly carbonation to it. If the carbonation was dropped a smidgen, the mouthfeel would be much better. There's a lot to love about this one - it's a good idea to revisit what barrel aged stouts used to be."
2705,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.71,"Been a while since I wrote a review, but this is worth the time. Worth the hype, especially if you love quads. Smell is amazing, plum, dark fruits and sweetness. Flavor follows the nose. What's most surprising about this beautiful beer is that it's not heavy as you'd expect from a quad and it's the perfect amount of sweet. Truly one of the best beers I've ever had."
2706,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.43,"Was cold out of the fridge. Let warm up to ~50 degrees prior to drinking. L - Portion of a bomber partially poured hard into a snifter. Thick, heavy dark brown with dark khaki head. S - bourbon, raisens, roast. Smells like barrel aged ten fidy. Very sweet. Very decadent. T - Cream. Sweetness. Alcohol. Milk chocolate... and a common descriptor that I've never used before - tobacco. Very rich and decadent. Very sweet, and very potent. Great taste. Love EMJ and this is definitely a worthy barrel aged rendition. M - hugely soft and frothy. Very big, foaming, and sticking to the palate. Think a touch thinner to bcbs but more carbonation. O - Awesome. Stands behind bcbs and parabola but might be my third favorite BA stout. Price however is terrible. I was a little torqued about ba ten fidy being $13 but this at $25 will he a tough revisit anything but a long time again."
2707,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,3.28,"RateBeer Best 2017. Milky golden beer with a white head. Grassy hops up front with some peach, orange, grapefruit, and non-descript tropical fruits. The flavor is pretty harsh, actually. Astringent and bitter. Meh. There's at least a nice hop profile there, too. But it's all kind of overshadowed by the aspirin thing going on."
2708,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.39,2015 vintage
2709,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.16,"A 12 fl. oz. bottle with a Julian bottled on date of 13316, meaning that it was bottled on 12th May 2016. Poured into a snifter glass. Appearance: Black in colour with a very thin tanned head that dissipated quickly and left pretty much no lacing. Aroma: Apple brandy, caramel, chocolate, vanilla and a light whiff of alcohol. Taste: Sweet apple brandy, chocolate, fudge, vanilla, raisins, oak, caramel and toffee before ending with apple brandy once again. Mouthfeel: Rich, smooth, full bodied with low carbonation. Overall: Another great sipper from Prairie with wonderful aromas and nice taste. The apple brandy did make it almost too sweet for me, but this was kind of kept under control so long as I only sipped it slowly."
2710,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.34,"Pours a beatufil purple with minimal lacing. Smell is of sour blackberry - sour coming from lacto, I am assuming. The blackberry is so strong. Taste follows the nose, strong sour blackberry flavor with a decently sharp acidity. Feel is super bubbly/effervescent. Very clean on the pallet. Overall, it is probably the best blackberry sour I have had, but falls well short of smooth and fuzzy"
2711,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.59,"In person trade from jvgoor3786 and poured into an Odell snifter.  Deep thick inky black pour with a tall creamy bubbly head of beige. Very pretty.  Aroma of thick, sappy bourbon barrel, deep chocolate, big molasses, heavy caramel, and suggestions of syruped figs. Wow.  Flavor is just massive. Tons of candied pecan, figs, bourbon, maple, milk chocolate, vanilla and chocolate wafers, candy shell, caramel roll, and molasses. All wrapped up in a bourbon blanket.  Feel is thick, sticky, hot, and burning.  Overall, a nearly perfect barrel aged stout. Incredible stuff. It's like a more wafer-like version of BCBS."
2712,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.52,"Bottled 02/19/19, it pours as black as ink with a 1-2 finger thick brown head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing. It was surprising to see such little head retention. Smells of fresh ground coffee, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, faint vanilla, cold press coffee, smoked malts, charred wood or campfire smoke, cocoa powder, cream and hazelnut coffee. It's so complex it almost seems barrel aged. Really nice delivery of all things coffee, this is a pleasure to breath in. Buddy Brew roasted espresso beans really make this beer. Flavor is as good as the nose with fresh ground coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, roasted coffee beans, espresso, cold pressed coffee, smoked malts/grains, charred wood, campfire smoke, hazelnut coffee, cocoa powder, cream and the additions of toffee, molasses, dark fruits, roasted nuts, milk chocolate, and Raisinetes. The bitterness from the coffee prevents it from being too sweet, but it does resemble bakers chocolate as it finishes. Super complex and very malty, but the coffee and chocolate bring in fruity notes, roastiness and a slight herbal tart pucker.  Coffee lovers should seek this out as it never lets it foot off the coffee pedal. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but it has that cold espresso feel and hides the ABV completely so it doesn't have to be a slow sipper. Glad I got 2 bottles of this as it was overall an excellent beer."
2713,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,5.0,"Sweet and syrupy, pretty tough to turn this down at any time . Rich complex flavour. Nice legs, perfect mouth feel. Favourite beer overall, but I would be 250 lbs if I drank it every day. 100.00 for a case of 24 that lasts me about 2 years. I reward myself with a bottle after a successful project. "
2714,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.41,"Season 18/19. Blend no. 29. Poured at 54 degrees. Deep gold with excellent clarity; thick, rocky white bubbles; initially poor cap retention, but as the bottle warmed, much better retention and moderately heavy lacing. Earthy raspberry aroma, with light barnyard funk; some aged cheese; fresh baled hay. Taste is raspberry, sour fruit, tart green apples and some funky hay. Light carbonation; light body, but not watery; dry, light acidic feel; minor pucker. Overall very pleasant to drink but no “wow” factors; fairly mild sour raspberry nose/taste; funk factor is low; minor ding to aroma score for cheesy notes; very good, but expensive...I’d drink again if at a lower price point."
2715,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.2,"64 oz. growler poured into a snifter. Appearance - Clear golden body. Nice white head. Some lacing and decent retention. Smell - Strong Nelson hops. Orange and a hint of herbal character. Sweet pale malts. Taste - Grapefruit, orange, a little tropical. That standard Nelson flavor. Pretty sweet. Mild bitterness, if any. Mouthfeel - Medium carbonation. Maybe medium low. Medium heavy body. Overall - I'd probably take regular Nelson over this, but it's really good."
2716,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.59,"Pretty freaking amazing, wasn't sure if it would live up to the price but no complaints. Thick, viscous well balanced beer. Not sure I would pay $50 again. Nice thing is I still have another bottle to age."
2717,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.48,"Batch 2 (2018), poured from the bottle into an FO b3 glass. Pours a rich chocolate fudge with next to no carbonation. Nose is pepper, cinnamon, sugar, and chocolate fudge, with both tequila and bourbon barrel characteristics coming through but not dominating. Palate is full of fudge, spicy pepper, cinnamon, and sugar. As a big non-fan of tequila-barrel beers, I'm happy to report that the barrel plays well with the rest of the beer, and overall the flavors integrate better than I expected they would. This is probably my third-ranked tequila barrel beer, with PNC and Leche b1 being the top two."
2718,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.2,"I like this variant. Maybe better than the base beer.  Thin with the mouthfeel. Warming. Semidry when you consider the style, barrel aging and adds.  The high ABV is apparent but not overwhelming. Not over barreled. Oak, vanilla, lower levels of dark chocolate.  The nose is all about the vanilla and the barrel. Quite pleasant and as noted not over done."
2719,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.75,batch 2 drank on 5/13/2017 at dld Look - nice thick orange body and minimal head....really bold looking
2720,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.58,"Haymarket is the type of place that I assume existed more commonly before the craft beer boom; a place that makes awesome beer, but somehow manages to stay under the radar (possibly due to how close it is to Au Cheval and every other trendy restaurant in the area). Seeing this beer on tap necessitated a trip to Haymarket, since it's rare to get a chance to try the stuff. Pours a beautiful dark brown with just a hint of red from the raspberries (think of a beer mixed with wine). The nose is similarly fudgy with berries. Really the only bad thing I have to say about this beer is that I wish it were a thicker beer. The taste itself is delicious, with LOTS of raspberry flavor for a beer this big, and the barrel treatment serves only to round it all out. Honestly, I'm not sure a thicker mouthfeel would help, because a large part of the appeal is just how much raspberry you get on the front end (which may be lost if the beer were thicker). I'm not sure this is the ""best"" BA stout with fruit as an adjunct, but I think it may do the best at actually portraying a berry flavor. This is like a chocolate stout mixed with jam. Awesome, and right behind the absolutely glorious 22 month BA Indignant, my favorite Haymarket beer."
2721,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.38,"2018 release. Released about a month ago. A: Pours an inky, dull black with a smattering of dark brown, RIS-like head. No lacing or much retention to speak of.  S: Cinnamon, dark chocolate, red chili, austere oak, vanilla, light roast, anise, dried plum, and a nominal amount of maple and bourbon.  T: Cinnamon, maple syrup, dark melted chocolate, alongside light bourbon and vanilla bean, finishing with a lingering medium-light heat from the chilis (not hot, but plenty enough to let you know it’s there). Moderate sweetness brings things together but fatigues the palate over the course of a pint.  M: Medium-full body, slightly sticky, with medium carbonation. Mild alcohol warmth.  O: Tasty and well-constructed beer, but the maple and bourbon are not that noticeable."
2722,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.35,"Finally found this beer in a bottle at a grocery store in NYC on 75th and 2nd. I think its good, but not as unbelievable as some of the ratings indicate. The malt taste is solid, and definitely worth drinking, but I've tasted better amongst newer releases (Prison Double Barrel Wham Whams, Other Half 5th, etc.)"
2723,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.78,"One of the best berliners I've had. Aroma of fruit and a little tart, but the flavors were really where this brew shines. The slight tart and funk was an excellent companion to the tropical fruit flavors. Made everything just pop on the palate. Delicious"
2724,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.52,"Can dated 6/24/20, poured into Alchemist glass. L: 2F fluffy white head, leaves webs of lacing plastered to glass and a cap and ring. Beer is a turbid orange. S: Lots of orange juice up front, pineapple, very ripe tropical fruits. Promise of much earthiness on back end. T: Follows nose, lots of fresh-squeezed orange juice with ripe pineapple and lime. Finish is extremely earthy, slightly bitter, with pine and dankness. A very muscular beer. F: Medium-bodied, pretty aggressive carbonation. Very earthy and slightly bitter finish could be a tad more soft and rounded. O: Obviously great, but again not quite getting the epic experience people are getting from it and I'd love for all of us to do this blind and see how it works out."

2726,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.53,"Bottled on 10.14.20: Pours pitch black with a 2 finger thick foamy/creamy light brown (sand) colored head, that faded slowly and left good lacing. Smells of maple syrup, fudge, brownie batter, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, burnt coffee grinds, roasted nuts, chocolate syrup, some earthy tones and oak/barrel accents. Almost seems like spices such as rye come through as it starts to fade. Wow, this is one of the best “dessert beers” I’ve ever had. It hides the ABV, it’s not too sweet and yet it’s very complicated and makes the best use of all the star ingredients. Like the nose the taste has maple syrup, fudge, brownie batter, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, burnt coffee grinds, roasted nuts, chocolate syrup, earthy tones, oak/barrel accents and then ashy, smoked wood flavors, pine cones, rye, chocolate milk, espresso and bittersweet bakers chocolate. Considering all the chocolate and sugary aspects this is not overly sweet and has enough char and bitterness to balance it. It has the campfire smoked essence, like the grains were almost burnt, which helps completely hide the alcohol. This was a tasty slow sipper with a nice chewy feel."
2727,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"Brownie, vanilla, marshmallow, roast, and barrel treatment in perfect balance. Viscous but not mucous. This has to be the perfect iteration of this style."
2728,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.31,"Canned on 01/28/20. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint. Thanks for trying Bethany — purchased on a February road trip by my friend but delivery shattered by COVID-19 lockdown. A: Hazy glowing golden with 2-3 finger off-white, stick, frothy head with good retention and drapes of lacing. S: Despite the age the aroma is still pretty strong, not I can smell it from 5 feet away strong but structured with pineapple, guava, passionfruit, and dank herbal undertone. T: Still very hoppy but probably a shadow of itself and still very enjoyable. Pineapple, passionfruit, lemongrass, ruby grapefruit, and tangerine come through strongest with more dank, herbal, grassy character in the finish. Moderately bitter with fruity yeast esters. M: Soft throughout with high drinkability (gulpability) with soft carbonation but fairly dry finish for the NEIPA style.  O: While I wish I had it fresher, it wasn’t to be but still tastes great and will look forward to another chance in the near future! Thanks Bethany and Christian!"

2730,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.99,"This one honestly elevates above stout and is in a class of its own. I realize there are adjuncts to this one..,, but they blend so well it tastes more like all the flavors are natural malt and yeast derived. "
2731,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.71,"2016 vintage bottle poured into a snifter. This beer, to me, is amazing in every way. Thick, creamy mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. An excellent mix of coffee, chocolate and bourbon. If 3 years of aging is the ""sweet spot"" I can't wait to crack my 2018 in 2021."
2732,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.6,"Look - Amber, syrup like color.. with a decent head that settles into a thin ring that persistently lingers."
2733,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.66,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A: Hazy orange-amber color with a one-finger foamy off-white head that left rings of sticky lace. S: Strong piney hops. No hint of any unpleasant sweet malty stickiness that usually accompany these kind of ales. Just pure clean pleasant hop aroma. T: Grapefruit and piney hops balanced perfectly with just enough bready malt sweetness. Bitterness lingers a little in the aftertaste, perhaps a little too long. F: Medium-full bodied; very smooth. O: Lives up to the hype."
2734,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.81,"Outstanding. Angry Chair makes some of my favorite stouts, and this is one of their best.

It’s a gorgeous looking beer and as it warmed the smell opened up to lots of fruit and funk. Tasting it, I get an amazing balance of fruit and funk. It could even be a bit funkier for my pallet, but it’s amazing. It’s tart but not too tart. My fiancé who’s not a beer lover said it was too tart for her, which usually means a beer nerd would love it. Overall it meets the hype and I need another bottle!"
2736,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.78,"Sweet AF, but you know that going in... the coconut is on point, body thick and oily, still super sweet. While the coconut is prominent, there is a lot more going on with bittersweet chocolate, muted coffee and some sweetness. Overall a great beer but definitely for sharing."
2737,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,3.88,"Chill haze pale salmon-red with loud fizzy bubbles settling quickly to nothing but a slippery, lightly bubbling surface. Smell comes across as oaky, acetic and vinegary, but also floral and fruity with tons of red raspberry. Taste is quite sharply sour, very very potent of malic acidity, verging into acetic, but also full of bursting raspberry juice, as well as some toasty char and a little balsamic lemon glaze. Nicely effervescent, satisfyingly so like champagne, but that quickly dissipates to a slick medium body with a stinging, semi-dry swallow. It gets far more acidic and sour as it warms, to its detriment."
2738,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.51,Dark brown beer. Reminds me of a wheet/white beer but with more body. Smells sweet and flowery. Flavours are bitter and sweet but with a light malty backbone to make it not over sweet. Lovely beer!
2739,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.94,"Big thanks to @my_knew_craft for splitting this one with me! L: Typical hazy Trillium, but it still glows with a promise of dank flavors."
2740,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.38,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/31/16 (yes, I know it's old!) with ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN"" written below it. Sure, this beer was quite filling but the flavors, stickiness, and lack of any massive sediment at the bottom of the liquid led me to believe that this was a quality brew, even down to the last sip! This beer looked like nectar as I poured it out with the waxy, hazy liquid being quite appealing and thicker than anything that I've had from Trillium. Hardly any lacing was left behind as there were just a few spots below a faint thin ring near the top of my pint glass. Lots of mango, papaya, ripe fruit, and tropical hops in the nose as this had quite a heavy aroma, albeit not anything terribly strong. More hops, grape, white wine, faint wood, and hints of a Wild Ale came through in the taste as this was much more complex than I was first led to believe. This malted out for sure but the Pilsner, and Flaked Wheat Malt held on along with some of the Galaxy, as this was not light in body and had little carbonation to keep things lively... This wasn't light in booze either but it didn't knock me out at all. Nice to see Trillium not brew a beer that I couldn't see through or reminded me of their other offerings. Dry like white wine, I needed a bit of water to get this down when I finished it off...but that's not a knock on this. It was quite a delicious beer that I'd easily get a second time around!"
2741,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.34,Similar to lots of their beer this imperial (porter?) stout shows some oak notes which make it kind of vinous. The bourbon is light and the maple absent. Lots of nuts notes. Quite drinkable despite the high abv
2742,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.99,"One of the best for a reason. Pours caramel color with a head that disappears quickly. Strong, smooth, and boozy. Chocolate and coffee aromas. Alcohol hits during the finish."
2743,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.04,"Foggy burnt gold with a fluffy short persistent blanket. Spicier, sharper and more dank than most of Hill's other IPAs, there's notes of black pepper and a noticeable boozy triple sec character I'm really surprised to experience in a Hill IPA, but at least it makes sense with the ABV. I was expecting a more approachable beer just due to their pedigree, but at 10% I can understand why they don't make this so often, being so far outside of their usual IPA realm. It's not bad though, by all means. There's an additional note of toasted cracker in the medium-light body as the crisp carbonation finishes semi-dry with a hint of vanilla on the exhale."
2744,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.4,"Feels, smells, and looks exactly like my favorite NEIPAs. When I drink it though I could be convinced it's a peach IPA which I wasn't sure would be a winner but this is a damn good beer."
2745,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.25,"Shared from a growler with Ryan. Pours a pretty hazy orange body. Fresh hops and piney resinous aromas, zesty citrus. On the tongue is delicate but flavorful west coast style zesty hops, piney and citrusy with a light bitterness on the finish. Moderate malt backbone. Smooth and easy, especially for 9%"
2746,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.85,"2014 batch drank on 4/2/2017 side by side West Ashley Look - hazy, dark orange. Definitely a boldness too it, with minimal head and incredible lacing for a sour Smell / Taste - bold! that's an understatement for sure. This is a stone fruit explosion. Just so strong and powerful and done incredibly well. The wine barrels and oak pop out with some nice complexities under this burst of apricots. Feel - thick, medium to medium/high tartness. flavors linger well. Overall - incredible"

2748,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.49,"In the glass, GoM is a shiny black orb with a thin mocha blanket that settles to thin film in short order. A swirl stains the glass with oily brown legs that descend slowly. On the nose, the oak and bourbon are combining flawlessly with the roasted malt to bring that rare and coveted marshmallow effect, while also providing notes of nutty, roasty coffee flowing into chocolatey mocha, as well as oak that's a touch waxy with a slight heat. Taste features oak and bourbon with a spicy, dry and woody herbal redwood that brings a little heat but is also waxy and round with nuts, bitter roasted coffee, melted dark chocolate-esque malt, and a hint of vanilla. I just can’t get over the woodiness--this beer absolutely excels here, and finishes with a touch of mature dates.  Crisp with a thin fizz and a tongue-tingling round, slick heat, the body is thin and thins even more at the finish, preventing a dry finish from chalking up. I've had a 2016 bottle, and then a 2018 bottle, both around a year or so old. Enjoyed the 2016 the most."
2749,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,3.8,"Looks like a typical imperial stout. Smell and flavor are both really heavy on the bourbon, hiding most of the biscotti flavor of the original. Definitely a bit thin. All in all a nice barrel flavor but much like the non-BB version I just don't seem to like this beer nearly as much as others."
2750,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.16,"Shimmering, lightly sparkling gold-amber with a moderate white fizzy foam that settles to a creamy ring and thin central film. Complex and mature aromas of vinous oaks and grapes are accented by peppery herbs, straw and honeysuckle. Tangy and lightly sour, flavors of green apple come along with an excellently balanced note of bright wine oak that adds an infinite complexity of grapes, orange rind and a hint of olive brine, becoming more acidic as it warms.  The round, medium body comes in with a light, tingly fizz and finishes just barely semi-dry. This reminds me a lot of Jester King's Biere de Coupage, and although SdF came first, I did enjoy BdC a bit more."
2751,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.09,"Used motor oil black with an intensely dark rolled mocha collar. Smell is all the dark fruit. It's really intense of date, prune, raisin, and more--all cocoa dusted, dried and well aged. Enhancing this effect is a potently dark charred oak that has a maple character. Taste brings tons of wood to the palate, while dark fruit still plays a major role with a sort of rum raisin character. The oak again is maple-esque before it melds into hot vanilla extract and toasted coconut. While this beer is very complex and layered, it's also numbingly boozy. The thin to medium body is assisted by a super thick, firm fizz and a very dry finish. I'm very happy I got to try this on draft instead of trade a pirate's booty for a stout that's overall very comparable to some of our solid, more accessible barrel aged bottles from this area."
2752,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,3.14,"Clear dark amber in the St. Bernardus globe with plenty of foam. Some sweetness followed by an attack on the tongue and other sensory organs. Burnt mango, grapefruit pith, It's got everything, including onions and cat pee. It's weird how this is all high notes, as in shrilling piccolo. I even think of the smell of a dry sauna with the wood and sweat. Hot, intense, acidic. It's all peel, no fruit.  As I observed in a long ago review of one of their other beers, ""The insistent hot and resiny taste with an unforgiving bitterness seems like the Surly signature."" From the 16 oz can purchased on the West coast. ""Canned on 12/12/20"" it says on the bottom, so not quite a month old."
2753,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.26,"2018 bottle thanks to the generosity of @2beerdogs, opened in honour of my Opa Jan. Pour is actually thinner/lighter than I'd expected, though once it gathers in the glass it does gain some more of that menace. But ultimately it's closer to a cola/dark syrup/dark chestnut brown than it is a molasses black. Not much head at all: nothing more than a drifting of bubbles around the edge. No lacing to speak of.  Nose brings less alcohol heat than I'd feared. Sweet bourbon vanilla and oak. Some caramel. Honestly just not as strong as I'd expected overall. More pleasant and mellow and sweet.  Flavour again belies the behemoth that lurks in these waters. 19.2% on the label, but I could be convinced of significantly less than that. Maybe not half, but closer to that than actuality. While I do get some heat, especially as I work my way through the glass, the prominent flavours are more the rest of the barrel, much like the nose. Vanilla, oak, caramel, maybe a hint of sweet sweet chocolate, maybe riesen-like toffee... This is decadent and rich without really being luxuriant.  Smoothe and while it's thin (unsurprising given the alcohol and that), it is not conspicuously so. Again, this is a masterclass in taking an overbearing characteristic and folding it in to subtly be simply a presence. That may sound like damning with faint praise, but I absolutely do not mean it as such. Dangerously easy to drink for the near-liqeuer level abv. "
2754,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.84,"Rich maple nose with hints of coffee. Syrup-thick body and mouthfeel. Taste is a huge amount of fresh maple up front, with some vanilla and buttery notes in the middle, ending with roasted coffee. This is basically a pancake breakfast in a cup. Rich and decadent."
2755,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.55,"thanks to Paul pour was thick rich velvety black. little head. nose was sweet chocolate and brandy, rich and full of dark fruit. similar to nose, spices were a bit faint and hidden just beneath the smooth brandy. chocolate and light roasted malts really blended together to make this is way too smooth and easy. the brandy complimented this perfectly.  thick and full with a mild carbonation. sticky sweet finish.  overall. really good, would seek this out. kills the regular version."
2756,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.47,"Sweet, boozy milk chocolate, hint of vanilla, and bourbon barrel heat nose on this one! Taste follows with a mocha coffee and dark chocolate bitter swallow. When chilled, the booziness is subtle and lingers. As it warms, though, that boozy heat becomes large and in charge on the backend! This a quality, well-made stout! This is very good, but, at 19.4% ABV, it is definitely a sipper!"
2757,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.56,Look: black and viscous. Almost no head. 
2758,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.25,"DSN...the first BA release from BL before FO explored into the scene of June 2015. DSN has always been under the radar, as it's not a pastry stout. I don't get the complex flavors as others, Molasses , chocolate, etc... I can detect barrel & rye, which is just about enough.  I've had them fresh and aged. IMO, better at fresh < 1year. Not 1-5+ years. At that point, flavors are muted."

Body/Overall: medium body, bubbly, dry"
2760,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.26,"A: dark black without much head. S: oak, vanilla, and molasses come out right away. Bourbon follows up the aroma. T: brown sugar, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and a long lingering caramel flavor. M: medium thick, with moderate carbonation. O: overall, just a real well done stout, with barrel character that isn't lacking or over done."
2761,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,2.02,"sickly sweet. foul. this is for college kids from vermont who like to clammer on about maple syrup and hippie culture. the beer itself is so disgustingly sweet that you should get a blood test after drinking one to see if this swill gives you diabetes. seeing a 100 next to this garbage only proves the point that the majority of ""craft"" beer drinkers are buffoons with no more integrity than a top notch brown nose pole polisher. this is not beer."
2762,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.75,A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black topped by a half finger of dense dark tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing

2764,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.65,"My oh my. So many hops! Smells like a tropical dream, taste is in all honestly a bit over the top. Foggy already has a ton of hops and this takes it to 11."

While cellared properly, this still didn't taste as smooth and sweet as it should...lesson learned - either TH stouts don't survive the test of time (even if no major adjuncts), the lactose doesn't age well, or something else. Either way, I'll definitely give this one another try and re-review as soon as I can grab a fresh can."

2769,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.91,"Today is a wondrous day for me personally! I crawled into the depths of my cellar and pulled this five-year-old beer out. I removed the black plastic off the cap. I hesitated and then carefully cracked opened the bottle. I waited in anticipation for the hiss. Gradually, I pried the cap off, a majestic hiss released along with a heavenly smell. The beer is 56 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer produced two-finger head. The head retention was short-lived but satisfying. The murky brown substance falls around SRM 22. The beer had a mahogany hue. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.  The initial aromas in the beer are toasted fresh bread, caramelized sugars, English toffee, and raisins. The next, I smell, bourbon, oranges, yeast, earthy, figs, molasses, roasted malts, vinous, treacle, sherry, port, wood, oranges, floral, leather, and vanilla.  The initial flavors in the beer are toasted bread crust, caramelized sugars, bourbon, treacle, molasses, raisins, and English toffee. Next, I taste, figs, , oranges, wood, leather vanilla, sherry, vinous, nutty, floral, tobacco, hay, rich toasted malt, dried fruit, and a hint of Maillard.  The mouthfeel of the beer is warming, chewy, and subtle carbonation.  The body of the beer is full, medium carbonation, a complete finish.  The complexity of this beer after five years made turned this beer into something amazing. I know it is a barleywine with an alcohol warmth and intricate malt body. The malt mixed with the yeast and hop profile marries perfectly. This is the reason why excellent barleywines have become another beverage I enjoy sipping the night away. I need to find a few more bottles of this beer and age them to enjoy later. Excellent beer!"
2770,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.58,"Appearance - The beer poured a golden orange color with high carbonation and a white head.  Smell - The beer smelled like fresh sweet apricots and light barnyard funk.  Taste - What strikes me about this beer is how well the apricots and saison funk work together. At the front, the fruit was sweet and fresh before turning funky in the finish. The finish was tart, but not overwhelming.  Mouthfeel - Carbonation was high, erupting from the newly opened bottle. The dry finish had nice lingering power.  Overall - What a well-crated saison!"
2771,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.35,"Yields a clean hazelnut brown to ember color with a small, light brown head. Smells of spicy Bourbon with a hint of coconut among scented wood, wrapped up by dried, sugared wild berries. Very intriguing as for its focussed complexity, sweet and decadent, reminiscent to the complexity of a port wine, also as for its prominent fruit quality on the nose. Offers molasses, glazed caramel and a healthy amount of rock sugars.  Has a medium bodied mouthfeel, slick and oily, malty and sweet, with a balancing Bourbon dryness, revealing a satisfying warmth. Offers sweet caramel from the very beginning, lots of toffee and a whiff of licorice round out the foundation of this. Sweet and full, decadently accompanied by a slowly evolving Bourbon appearance. The Bourbon establishes the balance in this, adding an alcoholic warmth and dryness to the flavors, as well as spicy coconut bark. All of this gets perfected by the berries from the nose, ripe and sweet, giving even more depth to the long lasting toffee. So this is two things for me at the same time - the beer is dangeriusly drinkable, a most enjoyable, flawless sipper. At the same time, this is challengingly complex with lots and lots of layers, all benefitting from each other. On top of this, there is the whiskey barrel, lending not only more omph to the taste but also a very pleasant and needed balance to the otherwise overly sweet beer."
2772,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.67,"Canned 07/03/19, it pours pitch black color with a 2+ finger thick solid foamy head that was pack with tiny bubbles, dissipating very, very slowly while leaving outstanding foamy lacing and thick rings as it went down. This had great looks for an imperial stout, so the fact that this is a Milk Stout makes it that much more impressive to me. Smells of maple syrup up front, followed by caramel or toffee, chocolate like a chocolate milk shake with hot fudge, fresh ground coffee, espresso, piney/earthy notes and a brownie batter sweetness. As it warms the maple syrup gets more intense and the overall aroma shows more depth and chocolate richness. Reminds me of Great Notion Double Stack. Tastes like the nose with maple syrup up front, followed by dark chocolate, molasses, caramel, toffee, chocolate mousse cake, chocolate milk, fudge, burnt coffee, espresso, brown sugar, mild piney hops, earthy notes, cocoa powder, brownie batter and a general chocolate-y sweetness that doesn't go over-board. Like all Tree House stouts the flavors remain focused and well balanced, allowing the coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup to compliment the roasty stout aspects and blend well with the lactose or whatever was used to make this milk stout so smooth. The feel is perfect as it slides down easy with mild carbonation, a touch of coffee bitterness and lots of chocolate notes that along with the maple syrup hides the ABV perfectly. Top notch for a milk stout."
2773,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.46,On tap at Southern Grist. Bright yellow haze with a fluffy white head. Huge Citra aroma. All citrus and berries with no catty notes.

2774,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.75,"2014 bottle poured into a KBBS teku on 3-16-19. I'm thankful that this aged so well. I'm sure the coffee flavor has subsided a little from its original flavor, but to me that is a positive. This beer is excellent."
2775,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.6,"I didn’t believe the hype. Then I drank the beer. Now I realize the hype wasn’t enough. Wow, what a delicious juice bomb of a beer. If juiciness isn’t your thing, don’t even try. If it is your jam, fasten your seatbelt. Amazing mouth feel, bursts of pineapple and orange aroma and flavor., and the 8.6% provides a kick. Must try for fans of the New England style."
2776,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.57,"I swear, put this in my whip and the damn thing will throttle like Senna back in the day. This oil is so thick and pure that it actually gives me dirty thoughts. Legal dirty thoughts, but still dirty thoughts. I love you ma!!!"
2777,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.75,"2018 batch - canned 8/10 8/23: I could understand the hype, but it was way too dank for me. It popped up in the mid palate and wiped everything else out, except for the greenness. Otherwise, it was excellent on the initial attack, with soft tropical fruits.  9/20: I am now part of the hype. The dankness and greenness have mellowed out to allow more of the tropical fruits to pop up. Dankness is still heavy, but comes through prominently in the finish with a medium bitterness. A month's time has done this wonders, and I like it significantly more than I did when fresh."
2778,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.56,"A big fan of BL, and chili stouts but this missed the mark. Great smell with some nice chili heat spice but taste spice is really hidden and out of place, mouthfeel is thin slick"
2779,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.09,"12oz can - dated 07/?/20 - poured into an IPA glass at fridge temp. Purchased at Novare Res for $9 per can (ouch!) Pours a fairly clear-slightly foggy deep honey golden hue, topped with a finger of simple white head that quickly recedes to a perfect collar, leaving no lacing behind. No visible streaming.  Nose: A bed of pale malt with a touch of toasty caramel malt supports a mellow tropical bouquet of lychee, mango, papaya, pineapple, peach gummy rings, tangerine, and green pear. Some secondary aromas of grapefruit peel, fir needles, earthy boiled Simcoe, and coconut sugar round it out.  Palate: The beer greets the palate with a blast of sweet biscuity caramel malts, lending a flavour not dissimilar to honey, followed by candied tangerine, papaya, peach candy, apricot, and a touch of pineapple. The malt sweetness is quite intense, and takes awhile to peak. When it does, it's still sweet, but lessened enough to allow some grapefruit pith, and pineapple-like acidity to cut through a bit. The finish sees some pithy bitterness, some hoppy floral notes, with a hint of pine sap, and that distinct boiled Simcoe note. Nice resinous pithy linger.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer drinks truly full-bodied, heavy, slick, sticky, and sweet - almost syrupy. Sweetness clings and lingers, perhaps almost cloyingly. Effervescence is pretty low, which doesn't help, and the only respite is the finish, which helps dry it out slightly.  Overall: This is a very highly-rated IPA, so it has a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, I can't say that I can put this up with the very best of the best. It is intensely sweet, syrupy, and cloying, and oddly enough, I think it's under-hopped. There just isn't any bitterness or intensely pithy, resinous bite to cut through that sweetness. It's barleywine sweet, and not IPA bitter. I find Double Sunshine (very bitter) to be superior, and Sip might be the best. A great beer to experience, but not one I'll revisit. If you like very sweet and malty IPAs, then you'll enjoy this one."
2780,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.41,"A- very dark, looks a bit thinner than other stouts, no real head to speak of. S-all those usual FW Barrelwork notes at work, caramel, booze, wood and coffee. T- chocolate, molasses, vanilla, coffee and wood again but excellently blended, as you would expect from FW M- Again a tad thin for a stout but I'm nit picking. O- excellent, glad I finally got to try this one as it's very hard to come by in NY"
2781,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.9,"2018 vintage - Pours black with a fairly dense creamy tan foam head. The smell of this beer from the bottle was an amazing sensory experience. It is reminiscent of something like a dark chocolate covered toasted brown bread with a dash of cinnamon on top. In the glass aromas of creamy vanilla and sweet cinnamon hit up front with a habanero pepper spice laying beneath, with rich dark chocolate, toasty brown bread, walnuts, oak barrel, some bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy pine. The flavor is a blast of equal proportions. Rich dark chocolate, cinnamon, habanero pepper spice, creamy vanilla, toasted brown bread, walnuts, oak, bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy piney hops to balance. Feels lighter medium bodied, creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a real great bourbon barrel aged imperial stout."
2782,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.49,"22 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2017 edition, had 1/6/18. Pours dark, opaque, with no real head and some spotty lacing. Smells of roasted malt, molasses, bourbon, cocoa, coffee, some coconut, light toffee. A light sweet aroma. Smells great. The taste is less roasted malt than the nose, also lighter bourbon, coconut, coffee, chocolate, some oak, light caramel, a solid sweet note. Tastes pretty great, too. Really smooth for the very high ABV, a solid medium to full body, well carbonated. Great blend of flavors and aromas, the Turbinado sugar and coconut star. Lighter bourbon than I recall from 2016, but only had a taste of that one. This is one you want to try annually, if you get the chance."

2784,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.19,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.14 plus tax. Canned on 5/10/2021, so this is a bit over 7 weeks old. Look: Pours a nice clear golden orange color. Copper colored perhaps? A thick one- to one and half-finger of off-white head upon the pour with a bit of rocky bubbles. The head has reduced to a quarter-finger with some evidence of good lacing. Smell: Aromas of pine, orange peel, and spicy pepper. Apple juice sweetness, floral honey. Smells nice, albeit a bit closed. It may also be a bit cold, so the aromas are more closed. Taste: This definitely packs more of a punch in the mouth than the nose. It's very full-flavored. Up front, a bit sweet and juicy, lots of orange peel aromatics and some bitterness. The beer finishes with full-on side-of-the tongue gripping bitterness, with a very dry and crisp finish. Very nice orange peel, pith, and pine flavors on the finish. That being said, it's incredibly well balanced and the high bitterness on the finish doesn't feel overpowering at all. It just feels bold and flavorful. It's refreshing and very drinkable. Feel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Very crisp and clean for a pale ale. Overall: I'm not sure if I had this beer many moons ago. It's OG for sure. I like this a lot. Unfortunately, it's not considered anything special in the beer landscape nowadays. But as a bit of a throwback ""back to the future"" nostalgia, it scores some points. Totally still relevant and there will always be a place in my heard for a West Coast-style Pale Ale like this one. I had the intention to drink part of this beer, review it, and then make myself some lunch. I've been enjoying this so much that the beer is almost gone now. I'll try to use some of whatever is left to incorporate in my fried tilapia batter."

Look: The first thing I notice is the beautiful color of this beer. It’s pours a translucent and slightly hazy appearance. The color matches what is describe as the pale, pinkish orange color on the inside of a plum. If I had to name the color in would say “pink champagne.” Bone white head that settles to a thin layer across the top, a thing ring of bubbles around the edge. One of the prettiest, and most uniquely colored beers I have ever seen.  Smell: Fruity, acidic, funky, all in unison. Peach and plum fruitiness with lemon and white vinegar acidity. The funk comes through as body odor and hint of plastic. Sweet, floral aromas. A touch powdery. Some light berry notes including strawberry and raspberry. There is a dry, crackery, wheat-like component to the beer. The most complex aspect of this beer.  Taste: On the tip of the tongue some lemon zest and juicy plum sweetness. Then the tart acidity takes over. Tart, unripe plum, plum skin, lemon warhead. The beers dried out quickly. There is not really any funk coming through on the flavor profile. I assume the wine barrels used for this beer held white wine as opposed to red wine.  Feel: Low carbonation and very light on the palate. Very dry with tart acidity hitting the jowels.  Overall: A delicate and highly drinkable beer. It’s not the most intense or complex saison that I’ve had, but it’s right up my alley with the fruit and acidity. It’s a beautiful expression of plum. It has some funk on the nose, but the flavor profile relies exclusively on the fruit and acidity. Really excellent. Clean and crisp."
2789,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.7,"Black-waxed 375ML bottle. The wax appeared to have a touch of concrete mixed into it.  The pour is deep black with the same viscosity & head of 5W-30. The nose is Three Musketeers bar with added vanilla & a slow base of bourbon.  Blessed be the person who is drinking this monster at any given moment. Like other insanely priced Anchorage shorties, this is thick. Redwood thick. Orc thick. Coated liberally with coconut & vanilla, & hard to believe, the barrels play third fiddle. The bourbon isn’t aggressive, but deep & earthy & complex. Finish arrives with bundles of chocolate & a warm feeling of well-being that washes over me. That’s either the alcohol or the theanine. This should come in buckets.  These Anchorage BA beers are stupidly priced & stupidly good. Superb beer."
2790,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.49,"2017 version Poured into a snifter. Medium brown color with a small tan head. Smooth bourbon, chocolate, oak, and sweet coconut on the nose. Taste followed. All the flavors melded well and the coconut shined without overshadowing the other notes. Deserving of it's reputation."
2791,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.44,"Bought at their Dojo warehouse bottle shop. 9/24/19 date stamp on 16oz can. Poured into 12oz snifter. Medium pour resulted in 1inch head that faded quickly. Clear, light copper color. Smell is not overpowering with some sweet passion fruit and pineapple notes. Mouthfeel is light for an iipa, but not thin. Taste is extremely well balanced malt and hop profile with honey (and lemon?) very present on the back end followed by some mild heat from the 9.5% alcohol content. "
2792,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.5,"2017 vintage; drank 6/2/17 @ Harvest Hop Haus. Black appearance. Minimal tan head; minimal lace. Cinnamon toast crunch, mild oak & faint bourbon heat notes in the nose. Thick, sticky mouthfeel. This tasted like cinnamon toast crunch with a bit of bourbon barrel & some chocolate. That said...it was an upper echelon ""pastry stout"". I'd have another..."
2793,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.67,"SO EXCITED to try this beer. I walked into SD Toronado (the SUPERIOR Toronado of the two) while I was on my birthday vacation and was shocked to see this sitting in the cooler. Yes, it was SITTING IN THE COOLER...for all to see. No asking the bartenders if they have it just to let them decide if they like you enough to serve it to you. This Toronado does it how it should be. Such great service, outstanding food, and great beer selection. Back to the Kriek,..it poured a lot less ""pink"" than I thought it would be. It was a clouded, light-red color with an off-white head. Scent is very cherry-forward with some definite barnyard and musty aromas. The smell is so darn inviting, I can't help but take few sips of this beer immediately. The cherry is so profound in this beer, more than I expected. A good amount of oak and funk. Not overly acidic whatsoever...in fact, not very acidic at all. Just a clean, funky, fruity, wild ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost puckering, with a juicy finish. Sour and juicy equals amazing in my book. Drinkability is VERY HIGH. Overall, this beer was worth every penny I spent on it. I went into the night willing to spend $80 on the bottle, just to find out it was $55. So worth it. A phenomenal wild ale."
2794,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.22,"Split with JLindros 2014 vintage. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark dark brown nearly black. Very thin mocha head that faded quickly to leave a light halo. S - Aromas of chocolate chip cookies, nice decent fudge. Belgian dark chocolate, no booze though. The rum is strangely subtle on the nose.  T - Taste is similar to the nose , lots of rum up front with a fair amount of barrel. The rum though is almost syrupy. Decent fudge and rich chocolate. Fair amount of almost fusel alcohol.  M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, alcohol hidden decent enough. O - Overall this beer was rather underwhelming. The rum didn't bring much to the table, in fact it seems to hinder the beer. Very disappointing.  Serving type: bottle"
2795,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.56,"Shockingly tasty - I know it's very highly rated, but for some reason I just didn't trust it to be as good as it was. Very easy drinking with a wonderful overall flavor. Probably my favorite de Garde to date."
2796,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.31,"A relatively gentle pour into a tulip still resulted in loads and loads of fizzy, beige colored head with some decent lacing. This is a very active beer in the glass. After 5 minutes, the head is still almost an inch thick and continues to be actively reinforced by the carbonation from below. Color is dark cola brown with a nice reddish tinge. Aroma is malty and sweet with a hint of alcohol.  Taste has a wonderful balance of sweet malts but with a nice dry finish. There's a complexity to this that I just can't place, but whatever those tastes are, they're working very well together. For me, the feel really shines. Medium+ bodied, plenty of carbonation but not overdone, and smooth in a way that really hides the alcohol. Very well done beer."
2797,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.19,"Got this one from Gary and Carrie this past summer. Thanks, guys!  From a 16oz can into a pint glass APPEARANCE: A hazy pour yields a two finger, medium looking, frothy, slightly foamy white head with good retention. A cloudy, muddy amber orange with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a faint cap and leaves some foamy lacing on the glass. A decent wisp remains until the end leaving touches of lacing on the glass as it empties.  SMELL: Lots of passion fruit, pineapple, mango, tangerine and lemon on the nose. Really, really bold and fruit forward. Some melon as well. Super fruity and enticing. Smells great.  TASTE: Passion fruit, pineapple, mango, with lots of tropical flavors up front. Melon notes too. Big finish of tropical fruits, some melon and caramel sweetness, as well as some piney bitterness and a touch of alcohol linger on the palate.  PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine with a bit of a burn and finishes mostly dry. A touch of bitterness lingers.  OVERALL: Excellent stuff. The nose on this one is out of this world. It’s a bit harsh for the ABV perhaps, but other than that, there’s lots of juicy goodness here to enjoy. Thanks again for the can, guys! Appreciate you thinking of me."
2798,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.47,"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Great spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas and flavors of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, toffee, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, vanilla, and bourbon barrel notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, toffee, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate pine, herbal, floral, grassy bitterness; and yeast spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, toffee, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, vanilla, and bourbon barrel flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness, and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a VERY silky, velvety, and slick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Minimal warming alcohol for 13.4%. Overall this is an amazing BBA imperial stout. All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, vanilla, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazing style example."
2799,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.13,"Huge thanks to bigda83 for this 500ML bottle that I’ve been lusting after for many gnat lifetimes. Bottled July 11th, 2018.  The bottle says share…I’m not doing that. The pour is a dark red mixed with dark brown, with the overall impression being dark. The nose is unexpectedly light: bits of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, & half a rack of bourbon, which is the only thing that comes on strong.  Maybe if I tell people my new kid is named Aaron, they’ll send me more of this. Because it’s pretty good. First off, it’s like being beaten about the tongue & gums with a wooden stave that’s brushed past a nice bourbon. Big, big wood with minor bourbon. The other main players are rich brown sugar, toffee, along with smoke-tinged maple & just a touch of booze. Exceedingly smooth & sweet. 500ML is the correct serving size for this baseball player.  So glad I finally had the opportunity to try this. It didn’t lead up to the legendary hype, but it’s an excellent beer that deserves to be in the top echelon of barleywines."

2801,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.1,"2017 vintage. Pours a deep mahogany with a tight band around the shoulders. Nose reveals hazelnut, cocoa, butterscotch and spirit/ethanol. Taste expresses butterscotch, cocoa, ethanol and a hint of soy sauce. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a lively carbonation. All and all - drinkable and ABV is dangerously well-hidden; however, I think another year in the cellar might be the sweetspot."
2802,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,3.9,This one has a lot of hype and maybe it's from when it was first brewed because I had this in 2019 and 2020 and it wasn't worth the hype. Still love TG but this one missed the mark for me.
2803,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.15,"This is a wonderful Quad, but the alcohol notes are a bit hot for me. I typically prefer sub 10% beers and have enjoyed 'worse' quads more because there are a bit cooler. Highly recommend for an experience, but not a favorite."
2804,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.69,"Decided to have and rate out of nostalgia and uncertainty over when it will come around again. Fresh on tap CBS is still a fantastic beer. The best mix of maple and bourbon I’ve had in a beer. Coffee, chocolate, hops, and roasted malts all contribute to a complex, well-rounded, and excellent taste. All time classic."
2805,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.9,"(2017 bottle) A: I'm doing fairly small pours into a tall wine glass, so there's no head whatsoever. Still a beautiful-looking beer: pitch black at the heart with burgundy edges.  S: Wow. Brownie, bourbon, and stone fruits. Beautiful aroma.  T: It follows the nose closely, but with more complexity. That brownie batter hits up front, and the bourbon appears in the background throughout; it's not subtle but not loud - just right. Lots of cocoa and vanilla. Coconut. Marshmallow. Long finish consisting of that brownie/vanilla/bourbon flavor. Insane.  M: Very smooth and silky going down. Has a thick almost syrupy consistency and is perfect for the flavors above.  O: This is world-class for me. It reminds me of Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Stout, which is my favorite BA stout, and it's on the same level in my opinion. I'm not sure what the other vintages bring, but 2017 is a true winner."
2806,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.63,"Dated 5/18/18 on the bottom of the can, one week since brewing. Pours an opaque soft pale yellow in the glass with a finger of dense white head. Huge pungent citrus aromas upon cracking open the can; followed by a light earthiness, fresh pineapple, fresh apricot, summer flowers, honey and a light wheat cracker. Taste matches the nose, think of a citrus marmalade w/ honey on a wheat cracker. At the end of the taste I get a little bit of ruby grapefruit pith and pine resin. Fantastic! I'm a big fan of honey added to IPAs and this really hits the spot. If you've had Buzz from Night Shift, this is that brews bigger sibling with a PhD. Super refined and smooth. Mouthfeel is a smooth medium with a little bit of prickly carbonation, low dryness but a medium- bitter kick at the very end of the sip. Not the stereotypical fruit smoothie, it's got both a detectable honey sweetness and ruby grapefruit bitter kick. I wish I picked up more of these cans during this batch!"
2807,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.01,"pours orange with gold hue, dense white head that dissipates quickly, leaving plenty on the glass. aroma is of candied fruits and pine. taste has plenty of spice notes, nutmeg, pepper, and a bit of citrus juice and peel. not very bitter, plenty of bite but fluffy smooth as well."
2808,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.22,"I feel like I’m supposed to rate this good but batch 2 is not as good as batch 1 and the creation of very hhhazy kicked very hazy down a notch somehow. I can’t tell you why but very hazy, when it was 1pp and you waited in line 90minutes was better. This is good but there are better beers in the line up and batch variability is a motherfucker. Some King Julius is better than emperor Julius was. The first Julius I had in 2016 was better than either of them. "
2809,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.58,draught
2810,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"What is funny about my SR-71 experience is - while I missed the release of 2018, I was able to enjoy the OG bottle the very same day. While cool/cold, SR-71 is tasting a bit oxidized. The barrels and quite a bit of chocolate are still present, but the beer tastes a bit dull and stale. As the beer warms, the chocolate turns to fudge, and that oxidization fades quickly. SR-71 is extremely barrel forward, yet still exhibits loads of chocolate and fudge in the nose and taste. It's a delicious beer, and I rate it highly - I think my one experience with it will have to suffice. Given secondary values, I'm fairly sure that I'll never see it again - and that's okay. This one experience has been quite memorable enough."
2811,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.06,"Cola black with a thin finger of fizzy dark-tan head that's quick to dissipate into a crown. Big bourbon aroma with cherry, vanilla and a hint of chocolate.  Strong bourbon throughout in the taste with a good amount of alcohol burn. A touch coffee and chocolate on the backend, which do give a mocha impression, as well as a little bitterness, which I attribute more to hops than the additives. Relatively thin bodied with a sticky, thin syrup feel to it and strong carbonation. Big in-your-face barrel in this one, and the feel isn't robust enough to stand up to it, IMO. I'm sure another pour or two and I'll be singing it's praises, though. It's definitely an ass kicker."

2813,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,3.31,"Tons of guava, unique but not my cup of tea. "
2814,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.71,"Pours a deep brown into the glass, and therein appears essentially black save for the translucent brown edges... A finger of creamy tan foam on top relaxes into a flimsy collar shortly after the pour... Aromas suggest bourbon-soaked dark fruits like plum, prune, raisin, and fig... On the sip, similar fruity impressions blossom, with a rich malt base and flavor elements of molasses and fruit breads drenched with booze... The feel is full, round and soft, with a little bit of chewy fruit under a light air of vanilla and dark whiskey...  This beer spent far too long on my wants list, but it was every bit worth the wait - one of the best English barleywines out there... Highly recommended..."
2815,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.07,"Hit of what I'm coming to understand is trademark JK funk, which is to say a little outhouse-y for me, but that settles down over time. On the palate, some light nectary apricot and a robust acidity that causes some throat burn by the end of the glass. A solid sour but nothing worth going out of your way for."
2816,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.29,"Canned 07/06/18, so 10 days ago. A: Pours a light orange, sort of orange juice like, completely opaque, with a third finger of off white head. Leaves some waves of lacing on the glass, with pretty good retention. S: Fleshy orange, pink grapefruit, a bit of mango/guava, and very light grainy-ness. Very well constructed, though not exactly bursting with flavor. T: Pink grapefruit and orange, fairly dry which tends to accentuate the medium-light bitterness through the finish. A bit less bitterness or a bit of sweetness to balance it would go a long way.  M: Silky smooth medium body but with what seems like a bit of gritty hop matter. Medium-light carbonation. Fairly creamy. O: Tasty, very drinkable IPA, kind of on the lighter and (somewhat, for a NE IPA) more bitter end."
2817,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.67,Terrific beer with amazing Brett. Great dank smell with perfect balance between darkness and sour. Great level of carbonation and an absolute pleasure to drink.
2818,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.43,"On tap at the Tavern Downtown in Hartford, CT. This beer did not blow me away and so I thought about why folks might be giving it the ratings that they do. In part, it is because this beer has a reputation as being one of the early great Imperial IPAs. For me what makes this a great beer is that it has retained its original profile, which is certainly more west coast IPA than anything found in Vermont. The bitterness is not over the top, but its just enough to balance the 8% ABV to make you think you're drinking a beer with much less alcohol. Pliny and Ruination are better, but this is a great beer."
2819,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,3.87,"2018. Was fine. Wasn't as great as I expected. Pretty light, smoky taste. Nice body for a porter. Comes in a very small bottle, around 8.2 ounces."
2820,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.33,"Dark garnet with a creamy, persistent tan-mauve blanket that lifts at the collar, leaving a bumpy ring of lace on the glass. The nose, wow. Amazing, rich caramel. Deep, dark cherry. The peppery oak of bourbon brings vanilla and an almost fudgy, marshmallow aroma. Taste is perfectly tart cherry with charred oak, spicy bourbon and a minimal sour sting paired with some heat and a rounding, smooth, creamy carbonation with a semi-dry, tingly finish."
2821,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.52,"Looks gorgeous in color and smell. I saved this for Xmas night so my expectations were high and they’ve been met. Lots of raspberries on the tongue. More so than any Belgian lambics that I’ve had (not that I’ve had all that many.) it’s tart but not overwhelmingly so. More so than someone who doesn’t know sours or lambics would normally like though. I feel like it’s missing the special bite of my favorite 3 Fonteinen lambics, but I don’t know what makes that flavor pop in my mouth. This is still world class and I’ll be seeking out more."
2822,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,3.26,"Pirate Bomb is one of the many variants from Prairie. PAA is one of my all time favorite breweries and I cannot get enough of Prairie Noir and Vanilla Noir. However, I was shocked to find that Pirate Bomb was so off the mark. The rum is insanely overpowering on the nose and especially on the flavor of the beer. I felt like I poured the beer and than a shot of dark rum into a glass. I know they were going for a rum kick, but this was out of control. The sweetness of the beer is quite good but after a few sips, the blanket of rum becomes unbearable. @firesidewithphil"
2823,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.49,"12.7 ounce bottle, 2020 vintage, 14.3% ABV. Served in a Jackie O's snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that stayed around for a bit. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like oak, dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, molasses and dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, with bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, caramel, fudge, oak, molasses, burnt/charred malt, brown sugar and a bit of licorice flavors. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich and a bit sticky with a moderate amount of carbonation. Booze is well hidden here, drinks easily enough for the ABV. I thought this was a really good barrel aged imperial stout, definitely worth looking for!"
2824,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.45,"500mL bottle from j47paco (thanks man!). 2016 release. Served in a Barrel and Barley teku  Pours jet black with about two fingers of khaki head. The bubbles fizzle away quickly, leaving a small patch, narrow brim and only a few tiny specks of lace.  Aromas of vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, tequila, sugar and some vague spice.  Both tequila and bourbon are quickly discernible in the flavor. Layers of fudge, mallow, toasted nut, chili, cinnamon, oak and booze.  Full, viscous feel with gentle carbonation. Rich aftertaste of double liquor glazed mole fudge.  Bottle Logic proves once again that they know their way around both stouts and barrels. Tequila was a brilliant choice for the second barrel, bringing a spice, earth and agave character that complements both the bourbon and the mole stout. Outstanding."
2825,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.73,"Look: poured into Spiegelau stout glass, half inch reddish mocha head sits upon a full black. Pours a flat, creamy consistency.  Smell: coffee and vanilla bean first, chili in background, chocolate is surprisingly somewhat hidden.  Taste: coffee coffee coffee. Chocolate/ Vanilla bean throughout. Chili pepper on backend. Extremely flavorful and sweet, almost overwhelming at first... flavors settle after a few sips. Slightly boozy but alcohol content is scarily well-masked.  Feel: flat and creamy at first and then medium carbonation punches you on on the swallow, when chili also becomes evident...really well executed.  Overall: great beer. Flavors are impeccably balanced. It is extremely flavorful, couldn’t finish a 12 oz bottle, but perfect for sharing in a tulip on rainy, moonless nights."
2826,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.34,"Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with a thick white colored head that laces the glass a lot as it fades. Big melon aromas in the nose overpowering anything else. Big melon and citrus flavors pretty much dominate the taste. Feels lighter than it looks/is, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall pretty excellent."
2827,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.36,"16oz can at share. Hazy orange pour with white foamy head. Mostly citrusy aroma, notes of tropical fruit too. Taste is fruity and full, super juicy, sweet. Top notch. I can see why the scores are so high."
2828,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,3.97,"Burnt amber with a fizzy head that dies instantly to an almost still surface but for a light effervescence coming up in the center. Moderate woody funk that brings both a little blue cheese and walnut underlies super sharply sour grapefruit and white grape that's somewhat vinegary, like a mango balsamic. The crisp medium-light body finishes paper dry with a little floral bitterness coming out on the exhale. Another overly SOUR Side Project bottle."

2831,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.56,2019 Bottle Pours Dark Black with minimal brown head. Smell like a million bucks. Get the quick hit of Maple. Taste is a Maple bomp with notes of chocolate and hints of coffee. Feel: It coats the palate for awhile.
2832,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.66,Look - creamy light yellow color slight head
2833,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.21,"2o16 vintage. Pours one shade shy of black with an opaque clarity and dresses with a swirl of foam. Nose reveals big coffee notes, ethanol and dark chocolate. Taste expresses sweet cocoa and vanilla with some notes of the barrel in the background. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even, mild carbonation. Overall, a very nice stout. All the flavors coalesced nightly; however, it comes off a little thin."

2836,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.31,"Bottled 5/7/18 Here we are, beer #600!! I got this bottle a while back and figured it was best to practice some restraint and save it for a ""special"" occasion, assuming you wanna call 600 beers a special occasion. Fuck it, I'm gonna call it a special occasion. I'm really excited to try this, the highest rated Flanders red and #209 of all time here on BA. Let's dive in Pours a cloudy ruby brown with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing This is surprisingly sweet in the nose, but I suppose the additional fruits and 3 years since bottling has that effect. I'm picking up on aromas of tart black cherry, jammy raspberry, red wine vinegar, vanilla, smooth oak, strawberry, and caramel malt While it offers a nice tart bite it in taste, this is still relatively sweet, but it only adds to the complexity. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting juicy raspberry, tart cherry, caramel malt, and red apple. The swallow brings notes of sharp oak, cranberry, black cherry, smooth vanilla, and a touch of lemon peel A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a rich and smooth beer that is also lightly tart to keep it alive. Finishes mostly dry and tart This beer is great, but nothing mindblowing. Still, I'm happy to have another style topper under my belt, and another 100 beers"
2837,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.61,"A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing S: Huge tropical fruit up front along with some citrus and light floral notes. Pineapple and orange cream stand out T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the huge tropical fruit notes and then brings in some citrus and floral hop notes. Again, pineapple and orange cream stand out with a hit of grapefruit. Low bitterness that slowly increases as the session lingers. Finishes with lingering citrus and tropical fruit M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very soft O: A great DIPA focusing on galaxy hops that is extremely easy to drink. Super tropical. Super citrus. Definitely worth checking out"
2838,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.25,"Wife Picked-up a four-pack at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for about twenty bucks. Guessing she didn't notice the 9+ ABV. Pretty smooth, considering the ABV, a bit dank, nice brew."
2839,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.5,"This is hands down three or four times better than non barrel aged imperial biscotti break. The bourbon adds a nice complexity that also dulls what I would call the ""fake"" flavors of regular biscotti break."
2840,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.5,"Pours pitch black, nice mocha head. Huge espresso aroma. Massive coffee flavor, nice dose of chocolate,, touch of coffee bitterness, and a sweet vanilla finish. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a big surprise from CC.

A bready aroma greets you with hints of stone fruit and booze. Flavors of brown bread, raisins, dates, and spices explode on the palate and finish cleanly. Mouth feel is a lighter leaning medium with excellent carbonation.  Overall a clear standard bearer for the style."
2842,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.84,"The imperial version of Last Snow porter is everything I hoped it would be. It pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger brown head that faded slowly and left minimal spotty lacing. It smells like coconut, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, toasted coconut, notes of whiskey and/or spices like rye. The aroma was very complex and full of rich malty aspects that blended perfectly with the coconut and boozy sweetness.  Wow this tastes fantastic, with plenty of fresh coconut then coffee beans, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, bourbon, toasted coconut, espresso, faint molasses, brown sugar, notes of whiskey and/or spices like rye. Some sweet aspects but not cloying and in no way a distraction from the outstanding flavor combination here. The mouthfeel is perfect and this has zero alcohol burn. World class."
2843,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.39,"2019 Vintage Pours a brown-tinted black body capped with a thick two fingers of khaki foam; good head retention recedes steadily to a dense, frothy collar, spotty, thin islands of cap, and a temporary walling of tightly-composed splotchy lacing. Aroma brings a staunch, explosive amalgam of ripe bourbon, earthy cinnamon, and cold brew coffee all atop a base of leather and lightly smoked malt; burnt sugar and toffee touch the middle, as tinges of vanilla cream and nutmeg round out the back end in a bruising harmony of sweet, malty character. Taste shows dark coffee dominating upfront, with cacao, leather, and fading bourbon imparted in the backdrop; fading suggestions of vanilla cream and undertones of dark fruit, highlighting cherries, prunes, and candied figs shine along the palate as a lingering bourbon-soaked milk chocolate, vanilla, and leather peak past the finish into the swallow. Mouthfeel shows a silky, surprisingly moderate body bolstered with a brief but filling, fluffy moderate carbonation to match; effortless mid-palate glides into perfect bits of sticky accents on the back end, where a moderate alcohol presence builds with exceptional touch along the palate, adding depth and a lingering warmth maintaining long past the swallow. An explosion of brilliantly acclimated winter spice and hearty bourbon barrel integrated into a powerfully lithe strong ale, this is a top-tier showcase of well-attenuated, boozy aggression; a beautiful blend and ale worthy of merit in the highest echelons of barrel-aged brew."
2844,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.79,"Classic Oatmeal Stout, the appearance is ideal, lacing is prominent and lasting, aroma is ideal for the genre and the flavor, so full of coffee and oatmeal and malts and cocoa- just really tasty."
2845,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,5.0,"This is probably the best Hill Farmstead beer ive had. It takes Floras great base beer and blends perfectly with the plums to create a something amazing. Id drink one of these a day if i could, it was that good."
2846,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.32,"Two week old can. Hazy and opaque, the color of orange juice. Great head retention and lacing. Aromatics: fresh cut melon, ripe berries, some wet grass and a bit of dankness. A bit sweet and fruity but not citrus-forward. Ripe, sweet honeydew melon is most noticeable on the palate. Almost nonexistent bitterness. Superior mouthfeel -- almost pillowy soft and smooth. This is an exceedingly well-crafted NEIPA, but I wasn't blown away by it."
2847,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.8,"L - definitely on the cloudier side of Trillium things. Turbid swamp water with a distinctly brownish milky tint. There was a touch of head at first, but it has since dissipated into a ring of lacing, clinging to the glass. S - huge aromas. Lights up the entire room as it splashes into my glass. Sticky, resiny, earthy pineapple rind with tingly grapefruit spice. Sweaty onions and dank melon. Hot, humid, tropical. T - hop saturation. Thick, acidic, yeasty. Somewhat bright grape candy and a floral bite, but the main attraction is pink grapefruit, melon rind, and papaya. Sticky, gritty peach must and pithy tangerine. A light peach halo settles on the hop dust. There's bitterness, but it's not overwhelming. The acidity sucks up any cloying juice, so you end up with mealy, hop-laden deliciousness. Subtle vanilla creamsicle when it's all said and done. F - it's thick and meaty without having to choke it down. Hearty, satisfying viscosity. Carbonation is a little fizzy, which isn't great and is unfortunately something you'll find in nearly every Trillium IPA, but it's tame here. O - this one is just so lush, creamy, and filling. Satisfies all the notes with supreme drinkability. Fruity and juicy, but with enough hop essence to snap you back to IPA reality. Nicely done."
2848,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.35,"Had been sitting on this for a long time. Wow! Absolutely delicious. A little on the sweet side but very tasty. Soy sauce, tobacco, cocoa, definitely a sipper."
2849,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.54,Type: 32-oz. growler
2850,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.46,"03/2015 - I've always a fan of this; awesome cinnamon and coffee, without either being overpowering, on the nose; lactose and vanilla ensure a nice sweetness on the palate; relatively thick body, especially for the style."
2851,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.23,"Pours one shade shy of black with not head, just a tight band around the shoulders. Nose reveals chocolate, peanut butter and a hit of cinnamon. Taste follows nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation, a hit of heat and a kiss of acidity. All and all a nice beer but I don't get too much of the barrel."
2852,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.74,"Wow so this one really impressed me. Pours a deep blood red colour with big white head. Translucent and very seductive. Smells very very nice. That Belgian smell comes through like crazy with nice dark fruit and malt sweetness. The sweetness is kind of a cross between fresh doughy bread and maybe a kind of banana character. This is very very pleasant. Some earthyness comes through on the nose and there’s a small bit of alcohol. Taste is amazing. Follows the nose in the fruity, malty, balanced yet kind of sweet goodness. This is a very malt forward and very traditional Belgian style quad and it gives its personality through the taste. Very awesome. Small, hardly noticeable alcohol and nice sweet earthy tones with lots of zappy malt breadyness. The mouthfeel is a nice full body with perfect carbonation. Coats the mouth in this kind of bittersweet dry finish. Beautiful. So before this beer I thought I didn’t really like quads. This is by far my favourite Belgian beer I’ve had and it’s one of my favourite overall. This is so drinkable and seriously amazing. The fact this beer existed in ww2 era is hilarious. This is a 100 beer and I’m gonna go buy more to cellar tomorrow."
2853,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.21,"Thank you, Sam. This was cellared a year-ish. A very dark brown with a dense, brown head with good retention and lacing, this looks good. The nose is great. Cinnamon, smoke, buckwheat honey, dark caramel, milk chocolate, all in nice balance. A little maple is present as well, along with a little vanilla. The palate opens mildly sweet but with the flavors of chocolate and cinnamon in nice harmony with milk chocolate, creamy and sweet, present. Vanilla and maple are present. Surprisingly light on the palate, this beer is soft and creamy and mildly carbonated. Very good."
2854,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.72,Batch 2 - Solera
2855,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.42,"Spring 2014 vintage; drank 6/21/14 @ the Yarchives.  Inky midnight black color.  Big dark khaki head with a few swaths of mocha; almost no lace.  Rain-soaked oak, caramel, fig, raisin & creamy milk chocolate nose. Whoa!  Thick creamy mouthfeel.  Smooth caramel, oak, chocolate syrup, figs & bitter baker's chocolate. Booze heat emerges as this warms.  Practically an old ale; viscous, flavorful & delicious. This was a superior to a bottle drank just a few days prior...interesting."
2856,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.69,"Wow.  This is the real deal.  Awesome color, head.  Smell was good, but not the best part.  Absolutely delicious. Smooth, complex, delicious.  Wish it was easier to find and not so $$$!"
2857,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.45,"Beautiful deep read with a minimal Ruby lacing around the circumference of the glass. Nose is pure Raspberry and some the jester King culture, very dry. The nose made me concerned that if was going to be pure acid. Suprised that it was a dry raspberry flavor with a subtleness of wild microflora. Feel is initially effervescent on the tounge and then quickly dissipates. Overall excellent, think it can slightly more carbed"
2858,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.21,"Growler @ Beachwood Brewing, thanks to Clark for this treat. Hazy orange with a nice white head. Wow, incredible fruit character on the nose. Tons of pineapple, papaya, mango, and grapefruit. Tangerine, some caramel sweetness, and blueberry. This smells amazing. Flavor isn’t as intense, but still quite good. Tastes like a blueberry muffin. Pine and herbal/weed bitterness. Moderate pineapple and mango with some grapefruit. Solid."
2859,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.43,"Canned 11/14/18 and tasted ~1.5-2 weeks later. A: Pours light orangish-pale with a smattering of bright white head. Completely opaque haze. Minimal lacing and below average retention. S: Bright orange and tropical hops, a bit of white grapefruit.   T: Straight hop juice: mango, tangerine, a bit of dried flowers and hay. Finishes with medium-light bitterness and a touch of sweetness.  M: Medium-full bodied, fairly creamy, with medium carbonation.  O: A big and flavorful NE IPA that hits all the right citrus and tropical notes."
2860,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.88,"Huge strawberry on the nose which follows through on the front end. Waves of chocolate and vanilla which just enough barrel to round things out. Mouthfeel was solid, contrary to the typical Cycle stout. Very impressive beer."
2861,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,3.3,"Tasted on tap at Ansari's, Eagan, MN. The coffee is front and center in this one. Pretty dry. I'm glad I got to try this on tap so I don't need to chase a bottle."
2862,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.8,"Poured from can into pint glass. Bright and hazy orange and peach appearance. Immediate hit of orange wafting from opening. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation, easy. mellow loving body that comforts the palate. Tastes of mango, orange, slight hop. Not overwhelming but juicy and drinkable with the hops ticking the tongue on the finish. This isn't one that hits you over the head, yet you know from the first sip that this is going to be one of your favorites."
2863,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.94,"Batch 3 served onsite, 375ml.  Look: Crystal clear golden hue with a typical pillowy white head for Hill Farmstead saisons. "
2864,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.49,"2014 Vintage from the taproom. Finally got to have the beer I have most coveted since I started visiting the enchanted beer mecca in 2013 and have proceeded to make the trek once a month since. All the trips finally paid off as it was there for on-site consumption. Had side by side with Le Sarrasin and Being and Time which might have thrown off the overall ranking. This was smooth as silk, fluffy clouds, extremely pleasant with where the base honey beer accentuated the wine barrel. The smell wasn't over powering, or super aromatic to me. A little bit of funk, don't know if that had to do with it being a 14. Once again the feel was the crazy thing to me and defintley stood out. It was super drinkable and if this was a beer I could have on a regular basis to have with dinner it would be amazing. I have to say that there was something tin the way Le Sarrasin finished that I like it better. This was a joy to try and hopefully will run into again. $33 for a 375 to the dome is worth it all day."
2865,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.44,L: Golden orange with a two finger white head.
2866,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.55,"A: Pours a beautiful light orange, with just a touch of haze. A towering white head fills my goblet with excellent retention. That gently recedes to leave some light lace."
2867,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.64,"Trillium is an impressive brewer and this beer is well developed but in my opinion not their best. Pipeworks has devised beers with honey far superior than Cutting Tiles/Artaic such as Sure Bet and even Spotted Puffer. Orange haze, decent head, underwhelming in flavor based on hype. Light/lacking in a zing that I was expecting. Another great beer from Trillium but my conflated expectations spoiled my experience."
2868,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.84,16 May 2020 - Beer #95 - BA Top 250 Alert! Corona Day #65 Price: $19.99 Lowry Hill Liquor in Minneapolis
2869,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.66,"Pours murky brown. Nose is figs, raisins, toffee, caramel, butterscotch, bourbon, char. Taste is a bit more subtle, with a well balanced profile of the aforementioned aromas. Nice, sticky slick mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice example of the style. Almost drinks like a stout."
2870,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.72,"L. Very hazy burnt orange color, thick froth head which recedes slowly."
2871,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.82,"*Aroma: Oaky, white wine, Chardonnay"
2872,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.33,"12oz bottle of the 2020 vintage, poured into a goblet. A: Pours dark as night and fairly viscous; opaque in the glass, with a dense mocha-colored head. S: I expected less cocoa nibs and vanilla honestly, but this is all milk chocolate and solid roast malt with dose of mocha coffee and a sweet vanilla twist; peppers and spices are fairly invisible. T: Yeah, it’s the same as the nose, just solidly sweet and roasty with mild coffee notes and faint peppery/cinnamon on the finish. It’s delicious. MF: Smooth, lower carbonation, creamy, full body. O: Really enjoyed this one; would have liked more coffee and a touch more spice/heat, but this is still delicious."
2873,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.32,"I read so much about this beer before I had it, I believed I was going to be beamed aboard the Star-ship Enterprise and transported to a far away galaxy, going warp-light-speed 69 with my hair on fire, whilst drinking the finest libation known to man!"
2874,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.12,"2017 bottle poured into a teku. Dark brown with a subtle head. Aroma is nice...barrel, vanilla, toffee and chocolate. Subtle hints of molasses and dark fruit. Taste really let me down. Minimal barrel, slight booziness with some dark fruit and molasses. Feel is onthe thinner side. Wanted it to be more viscous. Overall, good beer but don’t see the hype."
2875,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.41,"2018 release. A: Pours jet black with a ring and smattering of medium-light brown, fizzy head. Recedes quickly to a ring. No lacing.  S: Herbal (?) tequila, cinnamon, dark cocoa, spicy pepper, dusty oak barrel. T: Pretty spot on for Mexican hot cocoa: cinnamon, cocoa powder, mild burnt char, sweet and lightly spicy pepper. A bit of sweet bourbon and some tequila, esp. on the finish. Wonderfully integrated and a nice, moderate lingering sweetness that’s appropriate for the hot chocolate thing. M: Full bodied, chewy, with medium-light carbonation. Mild alcohol burn.  O: Flavors are well balanced and everything comes together very nicely."
2876,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.21,A 16 oz can with a September 25 2021 BB date stamped on the bottom. Purchased in Florida [unavailable in the Carolinas?] and served in a lager glass. 
2877,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.64,"Vintage 2020 A: Pours a near pitch black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap S: Roasted malt, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, dark chocolate, cacao, and a touch of the chili peppers T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of roasted malt, cinnamon, cacao, and coffee. Picks up the vanilla, dark chocolate, a touch of booze, and as it warms, more and more chili pepper. Finishes with lingering cacao, cinnamon, and coffee M: Full bodied with low-moderate carbonation. On the thick and creamy side thanks to the lactose O: A great Mexican-styled stout that adds another layer of complexity to a great base with the Sump coffee. Makes for a great sipper. Highly recommended"
2878,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.31,"$ 25.43 (Including shipping and PA tax)/500 mL bottle ($ 0.762/oz) from Tavour, Seattle, WA. Reviewed 8/23/19."
2879,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.79,L: pours thick and pale orange in color. Complete haze with 2 fingers if fluffy foam
2880,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,5.0,Absolutely loved this one!!! Awesome Bourbon Barrel notes up front be not overpowering...immediate chocolate....light vanilla and prominent strawberry finish! Only improvement is to somehow get mor vanilla into it...otherwise amazing and lots of brown lacing!!!
2881,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.46,"Poured a 10/14/20 bottle into a North Coast Brewing tulip glass. Solid black with a persistent tan ring of lacing. Smell of maple, vanilla and chocolates. Flavors of maple, bitter chocolate and vanilla (nice contrast), reminds me of Funky Buddha. Full mouthfeel. Hides alcohol well, maybe due to the Mackinac Fudge; nicely done, recommended."
2882,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.48,"now this is what i am talking about! this is how you use tropical fruit in a sour beer! splendid stuff, gives me a new respect for the brewery, and despite how the hype train rolls, i would drink this over their highly acclaimed maimi madness any day! brilliant fuschia pink color, not a ton of head, but electric, like some of the intense hibiscus beers out there, looks almost unnatural from the dragon fruit, but the aroma and flavor of both fruits is incredibly authentic. super fruit forward, the natural tartness of the passion fruit is a perfect addition to the already quite acidic and sour base beer, clean lemony lacto allowed to really develop. perfect ph for the fruit i think, max flavor extraction, a touch of sweetness, but i can still taste the wheat underneath it all. good carbonation, dramatic fruit flavors, just short of perfumey intense, concentrated, not for everyone i am sure. i loved how the fruits go together so well, and together with the sourness, awesome how low alcohol it is too! this is sensational beer that deserves the high praise it is receiving! nothing else like this exists to my knowledge. without question the best beer with dragon fruit i have ever had!"
2883,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.73,"Aside from Force of Will, the finest beer in the Tree House lineup, to my taste. It has the bitterness on the back end that matches the roundness on the front end. A tiny bit thin, but nothing to complain about -- it makes it easier to reach for another. A simply delicious beer that makes your mouth water for another. Ranks up there with Focal Banger, Pliny, and Intergalactic Warrior."
2884,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.5,"2007 batch drank on 5/13/2017 golden yellow with limited carbonation. smell and taste are funky, hay, barnyard funk, pretty tart, lemony, and some tart apples. great feel, easy to drink and pretty tart."
2885,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.46,"Been meaning to get this for a while, and corona stay at home time seemed like a good time.  Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Deep brownish garnet color with brief head and lacing. Smell and laste of dark tart cherries. Rich red wine, oak, sour berries and a pleasant earthiness. Brighter fruit flavors as it warms, strawberry, lime. Excellent with meat and cheese. Definitely mellows as you drink it. Great beer!"
2886,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.67,"A bomber bottle (no date) poured into a TH snifter Look- A deep black look with a finger or two of tan head. A nice lace around the glass and the head settle to the outside. Smell- It screams candy dessert. Coconut, chocolate, vanilla and a neat mix of coffee. The bottle seemed rather boozy but the flavors really came out when it had a minute to breath. The barrel aging was like an afterthought.  Taste- A fantastic mix of coconut and chocolate mostly coconut with a little coffee mixed in. About mid glass, I got some vanilla and caramel. Each sip seemed to finish with more of the bourbon barrel. Hard to describe the mix as it changed other than fantastic.  Mouthfeel- Medium carbonation with barrel finish that hangs around for a few bit.  Overall- If you are in the mood for a slow sipping beer for dessert, then this is definitely it. Chocolate covered coconut with a bourbon finish. Truly impressed with how smooth the mix was."
2887,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.61,"Good afternoon, NBS! Some yard work and additional gardening done this morning and now moving onto this one courtesy of  I’ve been shirtless in my backyard for most of the day. Neighbors haven’t complained of blindness yet, so I’m gonna keep this going as long as I can.  This beer is a “want” after seeing it reviewed around these parts. It’s a new state tick and a new brewery for me.  Look: As we approach the low 80’s with a cool breeze, this beer pulled from my 38 degree fridge is sweating. Almost as much as me. The beer should quickly reach my ideal temperature for the style. The frothy, two finger, espresso foam colored head settles down to a finger, leaving thick globs of lacing. As I work my way through the beer the head disappears leaving a thick ring of foam around the edge of my glass and some streaks of foam on the glass. The liquid is absent of color, opaque and devoid of visible carbonation. An appropriate looking stout.  Nose: This beer had a distinctive smooth creaminess on the nose. It’s not the biggest BBA Stout nose I’ve experienced, but it is unique and delightful. Soft oak, vanilla, coffee, milk chocolate. A hint of meaty roast and some fresh pumpkin aroma, followed by a cinnamon spicyness. Zero indication of the ABV.  Taste: Coffee with cream, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, fudge, vanilla, chocolate covered raisins. Soft and sweet bourbon notes. This beer is sweet, but not cloyingly so.  Mouthfeel: This beer nails the mouthfeel for me. It’s so smooth and creamy. Low carbonation and a full feel that perfectly complements and elevates the flavor profile of a bourbon barrel aged stout done right. A hint of dry toast and bitter oak on the finish. Sticky, residual sweetness on my lips.  Overall: This stout does not have the biggest nose, although it is very nice. The flavor is amazingly smooth and creamy, and the mouthfeel puts this beer over the top for me. The flavor is defined by caramel, toffee and fudge notes for me, and it’s delectable. As stated on the can, this is “honest beer” ad a result off “hard work.” Both of these qualities are obvious. This drink is an example of beer done right, at an ABV that suits the style without being excessive for the sake of excess alone. Hands down one of the best and most drinkable BBA stouts I’ve ever had.  Thank you so much, Bill!"
2888,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.85,"Tasted from bottle and on draft. Pours jet black with dark brown head. Aroma of bourbon, molasses, cocoa. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. Flavors of cocoa, caramel, molasses, vanilla and bourbon. Huge and incredible beer."
2889,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.62,"On tap at Bruery Terreux in Anaheim, CA. Wow. Perfect. Almost damn near perfect. It really is. I’m sure If Buzz Aldrin drilled for oil on the moon and took a sip, this is what it would taste like. Perfect on the eyes like Romee Stijd; perfect aroma like Romee Stijd; perfect taste like Romee Stijd; and you guessed it, perfect feel like Romee too.  I am on the moon. I am in a supermodel’s bed. Slap me, baby, I’m horny. Slap me, baby, I’m alive."
2890,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.79,12oz can from the source. Pours a clean burnt orange color with a half inch of clowdy white head in a Lawsons glass. Nice floral hop aromas hit the nose . Very smooth with almost no aftertaste. Some pineapple on the tip of the tongue. Perfectly balanced with the alcohol burn very well hidden. World-class is a correct description
2891,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.58,"Two of my friends recently put together a share to help me out after my bottles were stolen at Dark Lord Day. I told them it really wasn't necessary, but that seems to have even motivated them more! So we ended up drinking several top 250 beers, which is always exciting for me - I was stunned that they managed to grab a Pirate Paradise though. I'm a very big fan of Bourbon Paradise, and a huge lover of Prairie beers in general - this was certainly a wish list item! So, it's a little odd to say that I was slightly let down by Pirate Paradise - particularly as difficult as I'd thought it was to find and procure. Strangely, it seems that bourbon seems to complement the base beer much better - which is exactly what I would not have thought. Rum and coconut beers are some of my favorites - so why didn't this one work quite as well for me? That's probably not exactly a good or accurate statement, honestly, because Pirate Paradise is a damn good beer - but where Bourbon Paradise is almost TOO thick and sweet, this beer falls just a little short in those categories. Rum in the nose and the taste are pleasant, but it's definitely a bit thin in that. I'm also not getting the coconut and vanilla to nearly the same degree as in Bourbon Paradise. Quite surprising, I know. So while I like Pirate Paradise - I can't help but review it in the long shadow cast by Bourbon Paradise."
2892,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.49,375ml bottle poured into large snifter
2893,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.5,"On tap at the new Hop city location in the west end  Black motor oil , pencil thin brown foam cap slowly recedes to a creamy layer with islands Aroma of coconut , coffee Taste is coconut, hint of mellow coffee Smooth, silky mouthfeel , slight fizzy carbonation  Coconut taste lingers  Great porter"
2894,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.36,"L: Clear amber, white head to a ring. It's fine, but not what I love. S: Clean, grapefruit and some caramel malt. A bit of butter which is fine for the style. T: Better here. Clean grapefruit citrus, ever so slight bubblegum. Light malt. F: Great, this really hides the abv as there's no alcohol to speak of. Medium light and fine carb. O: Great beer, but it's very west coast, which I'm just not a big fan of anymore. But for that style, it's great."
2895,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.75,"Trillium can't seem to do wrong in my eyes. Fort Point is my favorite base beer, and galaxy is one of my favorite hops so this was a match made in heaven for me."
2896,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.52,"While placing the imperial porter at the end of any session makes a lot of sense when it comes to impact on the palate, as it's usually the strongest flavored beer of the day, coffee stouts can get in touch with out inner insomniac. But the imperial coffee porter of Kane Brewing is strong in its effects while carrying a caffeinated jolt; perfectly suited for pick-me-up and put-me-down of brunch. Sunday Brunch is a formidable dark ale of such character and placement as it pours a sparsely headed black appearance, looking like dark roasted coffee immediately to the eye. Its onyx-like sheen precedes a decadent and roasty scent that's laced with maple, spice, cocoa and coffee. Its strong taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple, molasses, caramel and toffee. Its decadence resumes across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to robust. French press coffee, black walnut, dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream and ushers in a bittersweet finish with rich suggestions of coconut, cinnamon and kahlua.  Full in body, the lavish stout is mild enough in texture to mimic the feel of a creamy, sugar sweetened espresso except with a Mexican hot chocolate under current. Spiced with a bourbon glaze, the oaken attitude of charred woods, vanilla, caramel and peppery tannins play a sweet and spicy tune on the after palate."
2897,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.44,"Bottled May, 2020. Poured relatively conservatively into a standard pint glass. Attractive hazy yellow color with a medium amount of fluffy white head, a thin layer of which lingers for some time. Tons of lacing, which is unusual, at least for the saisons / farmhouse ales I typically drink. Definitely picking up the sour on the nose, although it's not overwhelming. Taste is pleasantly tart and just the tiniest bit of funk in the aftertaste. Feel is pillowy soft and smooth. Less carbonation than I expected based on the effervescence that was present upon opening the bottle. This is a very well done saison."
2898,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.99,"2018 version. Poured dark with a small head. Smell was maple coffee with a hint of bourbon. Very smooth drinking and taste was wow - chocolate, coffee, maple, and a touch of sweetness. One of the best beers I've ever tried."
2899,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.06,"16 oz can into glass pours a little hazy but fairly clear. orange golden, white head. aroma and taste are heavy on citrus flavors. starts a little sweet then finishes with a medium bitterness. medium bodied."
2900,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.75,"Can dated 9/15/20. Poured into Trillium tulip shaped glass. Looks like dirty orange juice. Great smell of hops, but not so much as other Trillium DDH varieties I’ve had. Taste is really well balanced — not overpowering with citrus — with a long, ever-so-slightly bitter, lingering finish. Doesn’t stand out in any singular, exaggerated way, but a very nicely balanced IPA. Nicely done."
2901,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.21,"Great super hoppy beer! It was one of the first really hoppy beers I ever had and I fell in love. I was sad it only came out once a year but when it does, I buy as much as I can afford."
2902,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,5.0,"Dark and thick for a porter. Dense creamy tan head. Smells roasty and sweet with coffee, malt and chocolate. Tastes like it smells with a nice bitter finish. This is an amazing porter."
2903,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.34,"750mL bottle from j47paco (thanks again!). No discernible bottling information. Served in an oversized Bruery snifter.  Pours a hazy toasted lemon with a billowing two and a half fingers of fluffy white foam. The head settles to a modest layer that, along with a hearty crown, leaves a few traces of lacing.  Bright yeast character on the nose with notes of citrus zest, sour apple, hay and sugar cane.  Tastes of biting, tart pear skins, old grass, sour pineapple, some dry yeast, earthy funk and bread. Pleasantly complex and quite drinkable.  Light fluffy feel with effervescent carbonation. Aftertaste of tart tropical and stone fruits with some funky, earthy bread.  My first brew from Sante Adairius shoelws some outstanding work. Skirting the line between saison and wild ale, Saison Bernice is a deep, rustic, easy drinker. I'm not typically a saison guy but would have no problems knocking back more of this just about any time."
2904,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,3.89,"2019 Vintage  Pours from the bottle a deep golden brown and sits in the glass an inky, jet-brown verging on black; topped with a small khaki froth that recedes almost immediately to a slight collar, a few paper-thin islands of cap, and sparse strands of lacing. Aroma opens with level, sweet tones of oaky bourbon barrel, vanilla, rich chocolate, and caramel, becoming increasingly roasty leading into lighter tones of smoked malt, toffee, and cherry skins. Taste features a litany of fudgy bourbon notes, toffee, and oaky barrel upfront; sweet, smoky malt peak over the mid-palate into the finish of now semi-sweet campfire and vanilla bean touches; lightest bits of maple imbue every aspect of the profile. Mouthfeel has a medium body and low carbonation guiding to a silky, slick mid-palate; slightly creamy all-around; a soft warming teams with a bare minimum alcohol presence into the finish while a minor roasty bittering comes through on the exhale. This is a good imperial porter that is both tempered and hindered by a more passive barrel presence lacking intensity. Along the way, the maple interacts awkwardly with the roasty bitterness of the porter base as well, but doesn't delay the beer from taking its sweeter, smokier, and lightly bitter form. Solid overall, though unfortunately a bit too complacent and safe for my tastes."
2905,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.49,"Pours a pulpy orange juice color with a dense off-white head that literally coats the glass as you drink the beer. The nose is bright and dank tropical citrus aromas, with ripe oranges and grapefruit rind most prominent. The taste is a slightly bitter orange creamsicle, with some passion fruit tossed in for good measure. The mouthfeel is per the style, with maybe a smidge more bite. This beer is worthy of its reviews and status. Exceptionally well done, IMHO."
2906,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.35,"Although previously consumed a review hasn't yet been posted. So, this time, a twelve ounce brown bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. It looks good, but not inspiring. The color is a bright and light copper-amber, on the translucent side. There's only a slight head and no glass lacing. The aroma begins to improve expectations, as there's malt, hops and even honey to detect. The taste starts with a good full on earthy malt character. This never gets bitter, but it never gets too sweet. The body is near perfect and the balance of malt to hop is unassailable. That must be quite the accomplishment, since honey is in the mix. A wonderful exchange of sweeter malt and mild hops that 0deliveres a tasteful brew that may disguise its high ABV better than any other. Outstanding."
2907,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.31,"A- Tallboy pours into a tulip glass with a very hazy borderline murky yellow body. The head rises to a finger high with a creamy texture and good retention. Large sheets of lace after each sip. S- Big, bold and juicy hops right up front for which Tree House has become pretty well known for. Juicy and ripe peach and nectarine come on really strong with pineapple, tangerine, orange, mango, papaya, melon, dank weed, slight creamsicle and floral notes. A touch of oats and base barley. T- A bit more citrus forward than in the aroma with that creamsicle flavor joining in with all of the other ripe and juicy fruits. Peach, apricot, mango, pineapple, melon, slight passionfruit, herbal, floral, dank, papaya, melon and grapefruit. Oats, bread and a light-medium sweetness. Slightest bit of raw, green hops. MF- Creamy and very smooth medium bodied and a touch toward lighter than I would expect. The carbonation is on the high side and it ends with a moderate bitterness. Ripe stone fruits and tropical fruits. Smooth and a ton of great flavors. You kinda know the Tree House style by now and glad they are still delivering these bright and fruity hop bombs with good consistency."
2908,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.54,Extremely dark appearance with minimal head. Pours thick. Aroma is a pleasant blend of bourbon and malt. Taste is an extremely smooth blend of bourbon and malt.
2909,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.69,"L: super thick, and crazy dark orange with complete haze. The head fades in less than 1 minute. This looks like while fruit purée. "
2910,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.45,"2018 release. A: Pours black with a half finger of cola-like dark brown head. Average retention and almost no lacing. S: Strong coffee, light cocoa and vanilla bean, and mild rounded bourbon. T: Rich and strong coffee dominate the flavor, alongside a light but very well integrated sweetness, dry oak, and bourbon. Mild roastiness and mouthcoating coffee through a long finish. M: Medium-full body, chewy, with medium-light but cutting carbonation. O: Bottle Logic proves again its deftness with its barrel program. Coffee dominates, but the base and barrel provide nice (though admittedly light) accents. The only knock on this is that it might be considered a bit one-dimensional, and I’m not getting any maple flavor."
2911,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.48,"Smells like tangerine and orange sherbet. Orange zest, cantaloupe, and unripe mango. Finishes somewhat dry. Classic tree house pillowy soft feel. Extremely drinkable. Very solid. Tons of flavor without tasting sweet."
2912,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.78,The 2018 release of this is truly an elite beer. A fudgy barrel forward base is perfectly balanced with amazing coconut presence. The feel is super thick and perfect and the flavors are exquisite and right on point with the best of them. Great work weldwerks
2913,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.79,"cask pour at the cellar 11/4/17 - 4.53 revisited out of bottle (batch 1) - 4.59 revisited out of bottle (batch 2). pours pitch black with dark mocha head. the head has bubbles in it like a kid who’s blown bubbles in their chocolate milk. almost has a metallic shine to it. once that dies down there’s some coconut floaties. smells and tastes of sweet coconut and chocolate. pure dessert, but nothing artificial and there’s so much chocolate in the base stout that it backs up the coconut perfectly. slightest bit of booze but nothing close to the 13%. hides it very well. thicker than all hell. possibly the thickest beer i’ve ever had along with Coffee Shop Vibes. overall, a fantastic stout."
2914,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,3.59,"Can @ Monkish. Murky copper colored beer with a short lived white head. Really a surprisingly resinous and oily hop character here, despite still having quite a bit of pineapple, orange, and apricot juiciness. There’s a pretty dank aroma and bitterness, actually. An underlying malt sweetness to it as well. It’s not what I would usually expect for this kind of new wave IPA."
2915,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,3.16,"Thanks to Rub_This_BBQ for this one, from a recent ninja box. 16oz can (dated 3/11/21) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a muddy orange color with an inch of white head that had good retention and lacing. As expected, frooty hops dominate the nose, orange being dominant. No grain/malt presence. Starts out pretty similar on the tongue, lots of froot loops, but in the middle and back there was a certain amount of bitterness that saved the beer. The body was the typical medium-thin of the style, smooth, and had a finish that, while still on the sweet side, was much drier than anticipated. Drinkability was fine, probably great if you're a fan of the style. Overall, a nice brew, but I don't see where it stands out from it's peers. worth trying if you get the chance."
2916,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.0,"2019 vintage; drank 4/5/19 @ Yuss Haus Mach III. I found this less subtle than the 'regular' Coolship, which was a revelation for me. Fruit forward & enjoyable, but a bit one-note.  The base beer is a delicate beauty, best enjoyed on it's own. This will do in a pinch though!"
2917,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.34,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Teku glass.  Pours a deep brown nearly black body with a one finger light brown head that reduces to leave a ring of retention and no lacing.  Aromas are heavy on the whiskey with some cocoa and vanilla. On the tongue is vanilla-cocoa fudgyness and coffee with a heavy whiskey backbone. Mouthfeel is rich and thick with low carbonation.  A solid brew, good flavors but didn't get much spice."
2918,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.46,"stoked to have on draft....sweet nilla scent. rich, full, decadent feel...dark khaki lace...mild vanilla flavor..charred barrel flavor and a ton of heat. gonna go back tomorrow a grab another pour."
2919,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.69,"What I like about Cantillon's regular geuze is that it's perhaps the most different tasting geuze of all oude geuze's, but it's still a quintessential geuze. Beautiful beer."
2920,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.75,"super smooth, creamy, velvet-y, chocolate-milk.... my can says 8.2%, though, as opposed to this site's data and it doesnt even show it. who needs coffee when you have this in the frig waiting? starbucks should stock up on this!"
2921,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.74,"Hoppy, piney extremely aromatic. Pours a rich, clear gold with a moderate white head. Great mouthfeel, significant bitterness. Even finish and excellent overall"
2922,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.84,"07/2017 - This is bananas - I love all the elements of this ale, such as the nose and palate being chock full of maple, coconut, and coffee without being overwhelming. Supremely excellent mouthfeel that goes on and on. But my favorite part is you can't detect the 17%. Superb!"
2923,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.71,"Well damn, I thought the 6 pack of their Mosaic IPA was the bees knee's but holy moly this stuff. . . had it on tap at a bar in Vermont, not during our trip to the brewery. Pours the most beautiful hazy ipa, looks like orange juice, this even surpasses the prettiest Tree House stuff, which also impressed me on how well it did with a relatively ugly style of beer. 1"" of white head on an orange juice like body. Keeping up with the orange theme, the nose is all citra orange and tangerine. Where it gets wild, is as great smelling as this is, its the low point for this beer. Plenty of beers smell like awesome citrus.  Taste, jeez man. You know, if this was a lot more available, we could be flirting with a perfect 5 for taste. Truly separates itself as there isn't an acidic hop burn anywhere in the taste/mouthfeel like you get with ipas that are ""very good"". Its the best version of a hazy ipa I've ever had. Smooth, yet dry, has the best of both worlds much like the Van Halen song. I don't need complexity, just give me some awesome hop notes pushing orange and tangerine all day with a lower, yet firm bitterness and an amazing crushability notwithstanding somehow this is 8% abv. You can get wrecked on this effortlessly."
2924,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,3.99,Good but becomes too sweet as it warms. Lots of coffee and chocolate but the sweetness overwhelms. Booze is well integrated and surprisingly well hidden. Glad I tried but I prefer others over this one. The steep price kinda sucks as well.
2925,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.74,"This is quite an amazing brew. pours a a milky orange colour. nice tight head, with serious lacing . Nose is of pineapple,mango, citrus and stone fruit. taste is the same. Mouthfeel is very smooth and silky. Hops are there too, balance is impressive. Canned on 9/22/2020 consumed 11/12/2020. Can't imagine how much better a fresh one would be."
2926,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.86,"Canned on 3/22, freshest I've had by some margin!"
2927,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.51,"blend 2, magic! the best of the side project little bottles ive had in years i think, its not as sour as so many of them have started to become, maybe its because its fresher, but the base beer is old anyway, so im not really sure. more likely its just balanced out by all this fruit, just an absolute load of the blackberries, this is fruit heavy as they get, and all the berries seem necessary to balance a rather intense and complex base beer, this is really good, worth the hype, although maybe just a little raw and unrefined in the bottle. its a deeply stained blackberry color, but has a lot of haze and murkiness to it, some particulate in there as well, looks almost like fruit skins, cant complain about authenticity, but the beer doesnt quite sparkle, even though its bubbly enough and holds its airy white head rather well. aroma is blackberry and blackberry jam, couldnt be more obvious, and there is nice tang and funk here too, lots of oak, red wine, light fruit vinegar, and raw wheat, really impressive and interesting, and the boldness of the blackberry is as intense as ive ever known it in beer! my mouth waters like mad to taste it. the berries are as prominent in the taste, crazy maturity, woodiness, and juiciness as well, even the less enthusiastic beer drinkers around our table are impressed with this. the fruit and the sour are great together, the complexity is enormous, and the fruit is sun ripened and real as can be here. not all that acidic, i could easily drink the whole bottle myself, which isnt always true of their beers, and the bretty part seems well developed too. great carbonation on this and some solid blackberry linger. one of the best ive had with this fruit, truly wonderful beer!"
2928,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.22,Pours yellow hazy orange/yellow. Not like the new haze but the original haze. 
2929,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.53,"2019 poured from cellar temp on 6/17/2021  Pours a motor oil with minimal lacing. Nose of tobacco, brownie batter. Taste follows with rich chocolate, nice barrel, and some leather and tobacco. Feel is medium heavy with minimal carb. Overall, great!"
2930,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.78,"Previously consumed and often, this review will be perfunctory. It's undeniably one of the best in the world. Out from the 12 ounce bottle into a clear Imperial pint glass, it's a richly deep and dark brown with a modest tan head. The roasted malt, chocolate and oat aroma can't be surpassed by any in this style. It just might be the smoothest and richest brew you can find. The taste overall is complexly bittersweet. There's so much good going on, but the prominent flavors are roasted, not burnt nor overly roasted barley malt, then coffee, then chocolate. If that's not enough for the taste buds to discern, there's some sort of mild spiciness created by the infusion of the major contributors. An amazing mouthfeel for such an ABV, this may be the world's best stout."
2931,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.8,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small mocha colored head, and not much lacing. This smells incredible- just a big chocolatey espresso bomb, with light earthy maple syrup, high quality dark chocolate, toasted oak, heavy dark roast, cookie dough, bourbon, and brown guar. This is absolutely excellent, and one of the best uses of coffee I've ever had in a beer. The coffee is so fresh and vibrant, with a perfect roast level, some cookie dough and brown sugar flavors, and lots of chocolate. The beer is just so fudgy and smooth. The barrel is light, more oaky than actual bourbon. The maple is definitely a subtle touch- it is very far from a true maple bomb.  This is thick and chewy, and very creamy, with miraculously still a very drinkable feel to it. This is possibly the best beer I've had from Bottle Logic so far. This is absolutely wonderful."
2932,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.58,A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a decent cap that leaves good lacing S: Lots of citrus and tropical fruit up front. Some peach as well. Very mosaic forward T: Follows the nose. Big citrus and tropical fruit up front followed by some mellow bitterness. Peach and stone fruit present. Finishes with lingering citrus M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very smooth O: Super solid juice. Very much all of Julius with that extra mosaic and amarillo kick. Always worth a drink
2933,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.36,"Bourbon, toffee, brown sugar, charred oak, raisins, fig, leather, subtle rye and faint cocoa. This beer delivers on all cylinders despite a slightly sulfurous aroma."
2934,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.34,"Yeasty, fairly dry, and a reasonable barrel presence - wine notes are subtle, but grapes can definitely be distinguished. The nose is just a bit floral and quite pleasant. Light, but thick, and quite easy to drink. Complex. Very good."
2935,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.43,This beer is served on tap/draught. It has a golden yellow/gold pour with a small white head. Aromas consist of a floral citrus/grapefruit blend. This taste begins as it smells with a piney and bitter aftertaste. A hint of orange can also be tasted. Overall smooth and balanced
2936,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.87,One of my favorites of all time of any style.
2937,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.66,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of sticky lacing. This smells like intense candied coffee aromas, caramel, ice cream, dark Belgian chocolate, maple, and milk chocolate. This is probably the best non-Good Morning stout that I've had from Tree House so far. The coffee flavor is intense, but velvety and rich. There's lots of vanilla in the coffee flavor, but also a touch of maple and caramel as well. There's a touch of roast of roast to keep it perfectly balanced. This is rich, creamy, and pretty thick, but with a very high level of drinkability. There's a soft and lower level of carbonation. Tree House should definitely be proud of this beer. It's as good as it gets for coffee beer."
2938,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.46,"Recently canned, and it feels even better than the one I had in the brewery on tap a couple of weeks ago. And it was the same batch. For some reason, I think individual cans are generally better than keg."
2939,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.9,Shared the 2017 version of this beauty with a couple friends last night and it was great! Had it alongside both the Maple Syrup barrel Evil Twin releases from this year and the Double Barrel Jesus was better than either of them! Nice boozy finish which will calm a bit as it ages I hope (since I have a 2015 DBJ in the cellar) but has a ton of chocolate and bourbon on the nose and palate.
2940,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.74,There is a great balance between a raisiny and balanced sweetness as well as a barleywine type flavor. This comes with a screwtop so is almost like drinking a bottle of scotch or bourbon.
2941,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.42,"06/2014 - espresso, cocoa, wee toffee aromas; mild hops, coffee, more chocolate, roasted malty all over the palate; the finish is pretty astringent and the mouthfeel is thinner than I'd like."
2942,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.45,"Pours a yellow orange with a foamy white head that leaves some nice lace. Smells of malt, tropical fruit, citrus with floral and earthy hop notes. Taste follows nose with a delicious variety."
2943,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.17,Pours a completely opaque dirty straw color with a half finger of head. The nose has very potent juicy notes - both tropical and citrus. The flavor brings the juice as well. But the body is too thin and delicate to be really interesting. The finish is a bit of a flop - hardly any bitterness at all. This offering is still interesting but it is way over-hyped.
2944,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.14,"Re-review in 2020 with the same batch I had in my first review. Bottled 11/3/2016. Into North Coast snifter. We didn't know what Coronavirus was back then.  Inky, silky black with a small beige head of bubbles. Recedes to a fingernail with some remaining bubbles on top.  Aroma is chock full of tobacco and fig, with some dry bakers cacao and piney hop right behind it. Lots of roasted malt and karo syrup as well.  Flavor brings dry cigarette ash mingled with dry cacao and hints of chocolate. Some raisin and pine follow up shortly after. Finish is of leather, grass, very dry bakers cacao, and hints of raisin. I do not get any bourbon barrel. Feel is slick with a heavy carbonation and a boozy burn though not too much. Slick, resinous finish.  Overall, this beer fared better for me this time and fares a lot better than many 4 year old beers. This is absolutely a good beer, but the Vanilla Black Note is way better.  Price paid : $5.99 / bottle in 2016"
2945,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.91,"This beer exceeded all my expectations. Last years batch. The nose is incredible on this. Look: nice orange look, juice like. Smell: Smell is the best part of this. Great passion fruit nose. Smells sweet Taste: So good, best Berliner I've ever had, sweet taste with sour kicking in with the passion fruit. Feel: Not too much carbonation, really nice and smooth."
2946,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,"This dark nectar poured like a heavenly scented motor oil into my glass. Its like someone took my morning coffee, maple syrup and best bourbon and combined them into this once in a lifetime treat. I could still smell the maple syrup days later from the EMPTY bottle sitting on my desk."
2947,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.81,"Pours black, smell is a lot of caramel but the balance of sweetness is phenomenal with the barrel. First time having parabola and I will definitely be getting more of them."
2948,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.79,One of my all time favorites from JK. I have had each batch and while the most recent batch was not as good as ones in the past it is still one of the best sours they make.
2949,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.33,Canned 7 days ago.  L -- Immensely hazy orange body with two fingers off-white head
2950,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.25,2016 on draft December 2016 Look - medium thickness with minimal head Smell - straight raspberries and chocolate. Very little barrel
2951,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.43,"Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2017 vintage. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave light lacing and a thin blanket. Excellent lacing. S - Big aromas of barrel notes galore. Tons of wood, almost dust level, great bourbon notes. The chocolate malt is subtle, almost licorice like an Abyss. The alcohol is nonexistent. There is light oat in the background as well. T - Taste is similar to the nose with nice huge bourbon notes, good vanilla and barrel, good chocolate malts, nice darker fruits and licorice. The finish though...it's almost bitter spicy hops. Really weird. M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, creamy, alcohol hidden nicely. Really smooth. O - Overall this was a very solid stout, however, I think this suffered a bit of age. As good as this was I had higher expectations. The bourbon was still excellent though. Serving Type: bottle"
2952,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.44,Look - almost black with no real head
2953,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.44,"Vibrant ruby with a soft head settling to a persistent creamy white film and thick collar. Taste is full of seedy raspberry with a mild, balanced acidity that's woodier and a little funkier than Gambrinus. The soft fluffy body comes across as a bit more delicate than Gambrinus, and a little less sour. The semi-dry finish brings up notes of toasty cracker and a little char, but overall LPF is really expressive of fruit without the added acid that often comes along with it."
2954,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.46,"On-tap 2/10/2017 at Natty Greene’s Tavern in North Attleboro, MA, served in a tulip glass. A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a thin beige head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. S: The aroma contains strong bourbon along with coffee, chocolate, molasses and a faint touch of hops. T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of bourbon, molasses, coffee and chocolate. Then a hearty roasted malt character comes in. The hops presence is extremely mild as it should be and there is a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet. M: Very smooth and quite viscous, medium-to-heavy body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky. O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good big stout to sip on for a long time."
2955,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.55,"thanks to Hopelessly0 for the trade on this one ... even with the can being around 7 weeks old this was incredibly enjoyable and flavorful , which speaks to the quality of this brew. incredibly fragrant; juicy and ripe tropical fruits wafting all over the room! taste is creamy and pulpy - almost creamsicle-like despite the absence of lactose here. this is one of the more enjoyable NEIPAs I've had so far - really satisfying pulp flavor of orange/tangerine and grapefruit with just the right amount of pith and bitterness, and perhaps a slight earthiness... overall mostly tropical citrus and pure sweetness (not syrupy or thick, just naturally juicy - which is just the way I like it!"
2956,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.56,"16 oz can into pint glass. Per can info, canned 9 days ago."
2957,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.02,Got this one from Claaaark13 a while ago. Thanks again man!  From a 750 into a snifter
2958,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.75,L: very usual jet black prairie stouts. No head.  S: delicious. Great bomb smell but adding in the extra whiskey.  T: bomb on steroids. Might be might first 5 here. I love everything about bomb but the barrel just adds more. Super chocolate.  F: smooth start to finish.  O: amazing.
2959,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.77,"Pours an opaque very dark brown with a dark ruddy brown 2 finger silky head. Aroma has rich and somewhat sweet mocha notes. The taste is similar with the sweetness coming through stronger, almost candy-ish. There is also a great nuttiness layered in well. Feel is creamy and very soft with the lactose. There is deep rich chocolate malt along with a light alcohol burn. This is just fantastic, complex yet smooth. Deserves the world class rating"
2960,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.4,"Pours like it says, very hazy, with a light orange/yellow color that you can't see through at all. Light white head that fades quickly and leaves a little lacing down the glass. Smells of citrus and melon and some sweetness at the end. Taste is equally pleasing with big grapefruit, orange notes up front and finishes with a melon and a bit grassy (lawn) at the end. Smooth, perfect amount of carbonation, well done."
2961,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.46,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Cycle Brewing goblet. A: A: hazy to murky yellow, with low visible carbonation. Forms a two-finger white head that fades fairly quickly. S: A big punch of fruit up front - mango and guava and pineapple. Musty with some funk. Lactic tartness and wheat-cracker malts. T: Juicy mango and papaya, guava and pineapple fruity cream whip. Lactic tart, and a funk that makes me wonder if the pineapple is part of the tropical fruit profile or from a Brettanomyces addition. A touch of wheat pokes over the very light cracker malts in the middle. Tangerine and orange citrus show up as the beer warms too, along with more of the tropical fruit mix. Dry Lactobacillus, citric acid, and a dry lactic finish with more mango fruitiness. M: A light body but with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation sensation just on the low side, and there's no alcohol to speak of. O: Very, very yummy - South Florida in a glass. A nice meld of flavors, and while the acidity level would render me unable to drink it all night, it's at an enjoyable level for splitting a 750 two ways. Well done."
2962,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.52,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Opaque yellow/light orange color; almost like orange juice in the glass. Big, pillowy head on the pour with a thin rim that lingers and leaves great lacing. Smell is a blend of tropical and citrus fruits, but also dank and floral. Remarkably smooth and well balanced; juicy and chewy. The tropical and citrus fruit flavors are there with a slight sweetness, as is a floral hop bitterness that sticks around on the finish. Goes down easy for an 8.3% DIPA. Would seek this out again."
2963,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.6,"2019 release  Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. Look- Black, medium brown frothy head, above average head retention, average lacing. Smell- Licorice, bourbon, smoky oats, cinnamon. Taste- Bourbon, molasses, licorice, smoky oats, sweet coconut finish. Feel- Full body, slightly below average carbonation, mouth warming, sticky, syrup like, smooth. Overall- Wonderful beer, the finish was a little sweeter than I would have preferred."
2964,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.6,"Hazy pale color, almost no head. Aroma has fresh, unripe fruits like apricot, quince and mirabelles. Also quite spicy with some saffron and curry. Taste is tart and fruity with unripe apricot complete with skin. Really mineral on the finish. Light body, medium carbonation, really dry. A great, refreshing and really elegant sour."
2965,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.41,"In my teku it is a very dark brown with a half-inch, quickly dissipating, tan head."
2966,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.98,"Yeah, well worth the wait. All the hype surrounding this beer was well deserved. Color is glowingly orange, and I was stuck between wanting to savor and chug!"
2967,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,3.92,Large bottle ...$25 at Other Half in Bklyn Pours a bright and crazy shade of magenta...minimal to no head  Fruity n sweet nose  Bitingly sour and aggressively fruity Def will not be for everybody
2968,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.01,"This is such a big beer and there is so much going on, it is great, but you can only consume about 4 oz before you're done or you get diabetes. Let's calm down on the ratings a little bit"
2969,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.78,"2017 vintage drank on 11/1/2017 L-near-black, deep dark brown, very thin tan head but its lingering and lasting awhile, thick and lingering lacing S-Sweet dark chocolate, molasses, heavy oak, boozy whiskey T-molasses, bourbon, boozy, sweet dark chocolate, toffee, burnt sugar. The taste opens up a ton of complexity.  F-elite thickness, TG level, no heat, abv is on point Overall-not overrated by any means. Amazing. This would age well for sure! So glad I was able to try this"
2970,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.46,"L: Light maroon coloured with a one finger white, lively head."
2971,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.67,12oz bottle in a snifter.
2972,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.5,2012 Batch A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a finger of dense tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
2973,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,2.84,"16oz can (packaged 6/25/20) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a solid black color with 1/4 inch of brown head that dissipated almost immediately and left no lacing. Large coffee at the front of the nose, with a bit of underlying sweetness. A hint of peanut was also present. Same on the tongue, with the coffee being really powerful. The body was a bit light for a stout, but was smooth, and had a semi-sweet finish. Drinkability was OK, would have been better with less (or no) coffee. Overall, a well-made brew, but not one that was particularly enjoyable for me. YMMV."
2974,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.14,"6.5 week old can poured into a Teku. Full haze in the glass but no murk. Looks simultaneously juicy and creamy. Typical light gold coloring with some orange highlights. On initial pour there's a finger of big-bubble, soapy eggshell head with minimal retention. Splotches of cloudy lacing as I drink the first half. Pouring out the rest later (slightly warmer), the head is much creamier and holds up much longer, with similar lacing results. Very green, grassy, citrusy, and sappy on the nose. Lots of fruit notes ranging from sweet orange to pineapple, white grape to cantaloupe. Some generic tropical fruit salad and grapefruit. Mildly weedy and dank. Some peach juice, sugared berries, and 7-Up lemon/lime make an appearance late. A familiar Juicy Fruit gum is present, as well. Very nice aroma profile, but my initial impression is that it simply doesn't stand out in the modern haze world. As the beer warms, that impression changes, as the various components grow stronger and blend together masterfully. The greenness really starts to stand out, but it is balanced well by the various fruit components, most of which lend an attractive sweet juiciness to the overall experience. Really outstanding. And I bet early on the the emergence of hazie IPAs this one was viewed as an absolute knockout. The taste profile is shockingly dry and green. There's moderate bitterness, which for a hazie is unique but we certainly aren't talking about West Coast IPA bitterness. Quite pithy with a strong mineral note. There is almost zero residual sweetness, which for me is a negative but is clearly what they're after given the name (or perhaps the name was simply formed given the result of the beer). I like green, weedy elements in these types of beer when there is fruit (and other) sweetness to balance things out. But here the green ends up being a touch abrasive because there's simply nothing else to pay attention to. To its credit, there are still a number of fruit components to the taste profile, with orange, pineapple, grape, peach, apricot, and mango being clear enough to pick out behind the greenery. But each is extremely under-ripe and sharp with (again) almost no sweetness to it. The biggest kick comes from the strong grapefruit, which I like a lot because it naturally fits with the pithy, bitter, almost stinging overall personality. And while there are plenty of modern hazies that have sharp green taste profiles that burn and are extremely starchy and/or vegetal, this is completely different -- it's a kin to pure, squeezed, under-ripe grapefruit juice that is clean fruit and pith with no sweetness. Credit to Tree House for the naturalness of the fruit flavors, but you are almost waiting for some natural sweetness to appear and it simply never does. I am really fascinated by this beer, and I see why it is sought after and loved. It's just not what I expected (even with the name Green) and isn't really what I look for in a NE IPA. Just a touch of sweetness would take this beer to another level. As it is, I find it a little harsh, simply dominated by grassy greens and bitter grapefruit. But it is still interestingly complex, and certainly true to its name. Soft, silky, but a little prickly from both the moderate carbonation and green taste elements. Zero alcohol heat. Incredible lingering grapefruit pith. Nice coating on the teeth and tongue without any aspect of stickiness or chewiness."
2975,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.34,"Fresh ass bottle. Cloudy light yellow pour with a white head. Enticing apricot bouquet. Wow, impressive. Big apricot and nectarine flavors. There is a hoppy bitterness but it’s secondary to the stone fruits. Good balance with plenty of caramel malts. Good body and mouthfeel."
2976,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.43,"Big thanks to rudzud, 2017"
2977,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.94,"RR beers are incredibly difficult to find on the East Coast, especially in PA, where (according to one source) they are randomly distributed. Was very excited to discover a few dusty bottles dated 050118 at Waywood Beverage in Kennett Square, PA. Opened on 1-10-20 and poured into a champagne flute.  A: Clear straw gold. Rocky white head that settles quickly. Some lacing remains after letting the beer open up for a minute. S: Strong lactic sourness. Vinous white wine notes followed by golden raisin. Initially detected a sweet citrus (tangerine) aroma. Apparent oak tannins on the nose. T: Carbonic bite followed by golden raisin, citrus and lactic acidity. The acidity is not as sharp as I had assumed from the aroma - its actually far more restrained and well balanced, like a sparkling moscato or chardonnay.  M: The combination of high carbonation and tannins create a full mouthfeel despite the thin body. Some lingering silkiness, perhaps owing to soft water (pure speculation). O: Very well rounded flavor profile and balanced body. This is an elegant and quaffable beer, with just enough funk and acidity to be rustic and refreshing and not toilet stall and corrosive."
2978,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.3,"Foggy orange, appearing slightly lighter around the edges, with a short but persistent fuzzy blanket ridged at the collar with one long arm of lace reaching around half the glass. Unexpectedly, this features more wood and funk than fruit. It's quite mature, nutty, oaky and even dusty, with notes of cashew and walnut. At the same time, it's quite sour of white wine, apricots, green grape, lemon and mango vinegar (while at the same time avoiding acetic harshness). The moderate body has a soft then crispening fizz before coming to a semi-dry finish. While I was slightly underwhelmed by West Ashley, this is a marked improvement, and really in and of itself a fantastic saison. However, (while qualifying ahead of time that SARA has nothing to prove), for a saison showcasing a stone fruit such as apricot, it doesn't quite reach the heights of some of the greats. Fou Foune is already a tall hill to overcome, but even further, for me personally, de Garde is the king of the stone fruits, and just tower over everyone else."
2979,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.71,"2017 batch drank on 11/12/17 Overall, an elite beer. Glad I was finally able to try this after not being able to snag one from the last batch. This black body with a minimal head. Maybe the darkest beer I’ve had. The flavor in this are near perfect. The Huna base all comes through but more in a low to medium presence rather than bold. This allows the barrel to shine through really nicely. The dark chocolate from the base molds perfectly with the bourbon barrel. Fudgy, semi spicey, and mild cinnamon and vanilla. Delicious."
2980,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.71,"Almost perfect when it comes to BA vanilla stouts. This looked insanely pitch black during the pour. Completely opaque. Smelled of bourbon soaked vanilla fudge brownies. Really decadent. Taste was amazing....very similar to the aroma. Vanilla wasn't overbearing and really played well with the fudginess and barrel aspects of the beer. Feel was super viscous. Mouth coating and lingering. Overall, an excellent BA vanilla stout."
2981,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.75,Lots of people told me to not believe the hype on this beer. I just think it's impossible to get the strong blueberry taste like you do with a peach or raspberry lambic. This beer was one of the best blueberry lambic/sours I've ever had. I had it along side a lot of different blueberry beers and this one was one of the top 3. the funk was soft and the sour notes were very light but it was very smooth and I'd definitely trade high for this again
2982,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.09,"Bottled October 2015; drank 1/9/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Brown/black appearance.  Minimal tan head; minimal lace.  Burnt brown sugar, cream & oak notes in the nose.  Thick, creamy mouthfeel.  Cream, oak & brown sugar flavors up front; bakers chocolate bite on the finish.  Tasty, but not an improvement on the original."
2983,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.34,"500ml bottle, undated, poured into a Half Acre ""occult"" tulip glass. Enjoyed on 07.07.19, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick, inky and oily with a khaki head that has little height and retention with great lacing. The aroma is nice, lots of maple, rich and decadent chocolate, nice coffee roast, dark grains, brownie batter and a touch of vanilla cream. The flavors are in line with the nose, crazy adjunct forward, rich and sweet maple, brownie batter chocolate, dark rich grains, a nice light coffee profile bridges the sweet with some roast and acidity while vanilla and caramel ensure this finishes with more sweetness. The mouthfeel is great, thick, creamy, heavy body that coats well and finishes easily.  Verdict: A nice adjunct forward milk stout from Tree House. Rich, decadent, creamy, it's got just about everything for a pastry stout but perhaps loses sight of the traditional characteristics of a milk stout."
2984,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.5,"Received a single, twelve ounce bottle as a part of a trade almost a year ago. Looking through top-rated beers, and realized that I forgot to review. I did not trade for this, it was included as a bonus-brew. Not distributed to MA. Pleasantly surprised, very nice brew."
2985,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.94,"19 April 2020 - Beer #72 - BA Top 250 Alert! Corona Day #38 Price: $7.99 at Quarry Wines & Spirits in Pikeville, MD Appearance: 4 - pretty effing black, but the light-ish head disappeared with nary a trace. Nose: 5 - like a barrel aged imperial stout on roids. Taste: 5 - outstanding. We're in Bourbon County territory here. This one's not messing around. Straight up, intense, barrel aged imperial stout. Mouth: 5 - chewy, round, and very sticky. Again, no fooling around. Overall: 5 - at this price I wish I had bought a case; too bad they're was only one bottle left. I was lucky to even get the one. Cheers!"
2986,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.13,"Canned on 8/7/2020, almost a month old which is fine by me. Orange, peach, candy aromas, juicy as hell. Citrus flavor, bit of minerals, tasty. Overall I like the aroma more than the flavor but this is a good one."
2987,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.55,"2017 bottle poured into a goblet glass. An opaque dark brown color with a modest tan head. Aroma had sweet coconut, chocolate, caramel, and subtle bourbon. The taste followed. Really bright coconut flavor up front. The barrel was more prominent and really balanced. Sweet coconut and chocolate all the way through. Totally stood up to the hype."
2988,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.64,"Poured jet black with a thin mocha head. The smell of coffee, maple and caramel flood the nose. The taste of the beer has a nice sweet chocolate/maple flavor with a subtle coffee finish. The feel is silky smooth, finishes dry and a little warming. Overall it’s an outstanding beer!"
2989,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,5.0,"This beer is overall a great start to a good night or a wonderful beginning to a barbeque. The initial bite of the beer is not frightening and adds a nice bitterness to the pallet. The beer is very aromatic giving you the wonderful floral smell of hops. The overall look of the beer is very appealing, giving off this smooth, rich color of a thick, well-brewed IPA. The Flavor experience starts with the smell before even taking a sip, giving off a crisp scent that as you drink, will be surprised by the relatively smooth, almost creamy texture of the drink. For one that is more of a lightweight or for an overall non-heavy drinker, this beer is a great choice allowing for a moderate buzz with less. The overall taste is a powerhouse in your mouth. The only downside (And I mean the only) is typically the price which tends to be higher than that of a more common selection. It is definitely a party starter and great for special occasions. If one can absorb the cost, it would easily be the only beer you need in the cooler. Cheers."
2990,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.44,"Another excellent beer from Trillium, this one pours a thick, hazy yellow and smells softly of stone fruits. To the tongue, the peach and nectarine are most prevalent, but there is a little more of a citrusy taste underlying it. The milky texture and grainy undertones prevent this from being too fruity."
2991,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.59,"750 mL into a wine glass. A- Peach-skin colored. Hazy with low-carbonation. 4.5 S- Distinctive Casey aroma. Funky and yeasty with a delicate floral quality followed by unripe, tart peach. Not nearly as fruity or explosive as the Side Project version's aroma. 4.25 T- Tart but juicy and almost pulpy peach hits the palate. Tons of peach all over this in all types of incantations: spicy, jammy, earthy, tangy. Pretty awesome. 4.75 M- Tart, a touch yeasty, floral, lemon-y and light with acidity. 4.5 Pretty damn outstanding."
2992,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.47,"The blueberry taste was a little more subdued than I expected, but despite that it's still a fantastic beer. Goes without saying that it feels pretty cool to notch this one off my bucket list - it helps to have friends who are connected!"
2993,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.85,"Pseudo Sue pours a cloudy/milky looking orange/pineapple/mango juice color with nice head and a fragrant nose of citrus fruit. Pineapple, orange and mango. add those fruity juices together and some pine cones. There's your perfect juice bomb for hop heads. This is after a King Sue. So the hop bitterness is really perfect in this blend/combination. The grapefruit is starting to settle on the tongue and holy cow. bow wowowow This sixteen ounce can was stamped BEST BY 09/04/21"
2994,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.24,"Caged and corked bottle dated dec3.,2020 and opened May 16,2021 Fizzy pink foam immediately evaporated over a translucent ruby red liquid  Aroma is tart raspberries Taste is tart , raspberry , and more tart , hint of apricot , the funk is there  Very tart , fizzy sudsing , tart bone dry finish  Good beer"
2995,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,3.93,"2017 Release. 20.0% ABV. The pour is a dark brown with a distinct crimson hue. Hardly any head appears, but what does bubble up is a nice ivory color. Thin and spaced out, quick to disappear.  As was expected, this thing is BOOZY, with lots of dark fruit right away on the nose. As it warms, bourbon and oak come forth with some urgency. The booze is still overwhelming, but the subtly complex aromas that come peeking through that ethanol are pleasant, and chocolate in particular becomes gradually more prevalent. In the flavors you get more of that powerful booziness, but it is not as overwhelming as the nose. Oak and bourbon is noticeable, with that stinging alcohol quick to follow it up. As it warms, you get some nuttiness, but can’t really pick out hazelnuts specifically. Hazelnuts are one of those nuts that can be potent in a beer, but even just a year bottle conditioning with an ABV that high can swallow up some of the originally intended components.  The body on Grey Monday is thin, but with a syrupy feel and a low carbonation. Sharp, stinging booze is present throughout and makes for a hot finish. Closer to the liquor end of the spectrum than beer, honestly."
2996,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.31,"A - Pours a hazy golden orange with a two finger creamy white head. Tons of sticky lacing. S - Aroma is orange, pineapple, grapefruit and  T - The taste is orange, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, bready malts and earthy bitter hops. M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish. O - Really tasty all citra NEPA. Really glad I got a chance to get my handing on this."
2997,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.48,"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)..."
2998,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.34,"Growler filled January 2015; drank 1/29/15 @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Cloudy light yellow appearance.  HUGE white head; thick lace.  Pineapple, fresh-cut grass & mango nose.  Thin mouthfeel. Pineapple & dandelion flavors up front; a clean, spring water finish.  Tasty & refreshing; a damn fine IPA."
2999,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.59,"Art b5 served from 375ml at the brewery. Dregs separated by server. Pours a clear, straw body with a one finger white head. That sticks around for the duration of the drink. Spotty lacing.  On the nose is Funky hay, white wine, apple juice, lightly tart citrus, yeasty, barnyard, champagne-like.  On the tongue are delicate notes of sour apple, citrus, mingled with oak and champagne, lightly funky with a distinctive hill Farmstead barnyard taste. Dry finish, lightly carbonated. Very easy to drink.  Art lived up to the hype for me. This is so complex yet very balanced and delicate. More champagne-like than flora."
3000,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.34,"been looking forward to trying this one for a long time and am stoked to have finally gotten the chance. this is a really neat and sort of unexpected beer, strange to name a strong barrel aged stout thirsty ale, like it implies easy drinking or high volume beer or something, but this is anything but, and it would take a special kind of thirst to want to drink a ton of this one. a rye whiskey barrel aged imperial stout with raspberries, and a wonderful one at that. i go back and forth on the fruited stouts, sometimes they get way too sweet and candy-like with the chocolate in the malt and the fruit sugars, but the raspberries are as tart as they are sweet in this, so while it has some residual sugar and raspberry jam qualities, its also really natural tasting, clean, and fairly acidic from their tartness. its amazing how forward the fruit is in such a dense strong dark beer. sure there is still plenty of dark malt in here, its intensely roasty with a coffee quality to it, and there is some barrel char and earthy wet wood as well, but the summery brightness of the berries lightens it all up and really defines this beer for me. rye is a smart choice for barrels too, its less sweet in this manifestation than bourbon would have been, and the dense slightly spicy rye character makes the grain base seem particularly interesting to me. light vanilla too, but it isnt desserty so much. dark cocoa, a little bitterness, and whiskey, along with old school raspberry jam in the finish, its just delicious and about as well done as something like this could be. this reminds me of an excellent raspberry stout i had from hardywood park a few years back but with the barrel, but other than that beer, quite original. worth the hype!"
3001,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.6,"A 2014 bottle from the reserve collection at Jackie O’s production brewery served in a snifter.  Look- A dense black with a little less than a finger of dark mocha head. Surprised that there was virtually no lacing with this one.  Smell- Tons of vanilla, maple, and bourbon with a nutty aroma mixed in. The barrel doesn’t really dominate like I expected.  Taste- I’ll start by saying wow! The vanilla and bourbon mix is fantastic. The hazelnuts and chocolate are there, too. The maple has mellowed with age but probably gives some of the sweetness.  Mouthfeel- Light carbonation with a creamy smooth finish. The subtle sweetness hangs around with every sip.  Overall- A great offering from Jackie O’s. Not certain about this being a porter but it was still great. Definitely worth the trip."
3002,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,3.75,"Deep, dark, viscous stout. At first, the combination of roasted barley, somewhat bitter coffee and subtle sweet shadings of vanilla blend, giving the beer an interesting roll-out. After a few sips, the bitterness takes over, which makes the beer one-note. Solid yes, but I'm surprised by the world class rating."
3003,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.1,"Pours a dark, ruby red with a finger-plus or purple head. Settles fairly quickly into a wisp and thick crown. Big raspberry aroma, with wood and hay quite present as well. Sour tasting with strong hay, strong wood and hairy raspberries. A hint of vanilla, too. Medium bodied and somewhat creamy. Tasty. Really strong hay cuts through the fresh raspberry preventing it from being sweet."
3004,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.58,"Extremely well-done. Lots and lots of lupulin. I was worried it would be too sweet when I saw ""honey"" featured on the label, but I honestly couldn't taste it. I think it must just balance all that mosaic. If Trillium didn't make so many good beers, I could drink this one all the time. Alas . . ."

3006,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.28,"Appearance - The beer poured an orange-ish yellow color with a white head crowning the glass.  Smell - The nose was hazy orange, as is most typical for a NE IPA. It did not profile overly sweet.  Taste - Initially, I was surprised that this was not very sweet. I detected pine, citrus, fresh cut grass, and passionfruit. It was a little dank and spicy with a little bit of warmth at the end. Mouthfeel - There was some viscosity in this beer with a high level of sediment at the bottom of the can.  Overall - I believe I liked the non-double dry hopped version better."
3007,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,3.9,"Solid beer. Tastes like a lot of the other Treehouse stouts. Pours dark with tan head. Nose is muted chocolate and copper. Taste is big chocolate, a bit sweet. Lots of flavor for a relatively low abv stout"
3008,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.81,"Wow! This is really good Flanders Ale. Appearance – Pours a beautiful clear amber red with a nice head that doesn't last long.. Smell – A really wonderful smell, which smelled great before I even had a chance to think about what was in it. Cherry, raspberry, cranberry, oak, and Flanders' funk, that's not overly sour. Wow, this smells really good!  Taste – The taste is similar to the smell. I really like it because it's not too sour, it's got just the right sweetness and tartness to it for me. Very good. Mouthfeel – A very nice carbonation. Super easy to drink because it tastes so good. Drinkability – This beer really took me by surprise. I'm not a huge fan of the style because it's usually too sour for my taste, but this is perfect. It's SO easy to drink."

3011,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.86,"This was canned 3 days ago!!!! Appearance: Looks like a hazy IPA, nothing special in this department. Yellow haze, thin head, small bubbles Smell: In a word, awesome, notes in order of most to least: big citrus rind, big dank, big malt sweet, some pineapple, some melon Taste: Even better than aroma. Balanced just the way I like, primarily hop forward but a solid malt backbone. Sweet malt presence but way less than you would expect from aroma. Big citrus, big tropical, big dank, solid sweet malt, solid bitter, light bready malt, light pine/resin, no booze, finishes dry Feel: Medium body, creamy, dry finish, not astringent Overall: Outside of appearance this is among the best DIPA's I have ever had. While the flavor profile is common, this is just better executed than most. It balances the flavors in a way that suits my preference while having a world class aroma and feel. It is also worth pointing out how fresh the beer is, which certainly plays a role here."
3012,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.45,"22 oz bottle poured into flute glass. Black with little to no lacing. Nose: bourbon and vanilla up front, coffee. Some chocolate undertones.

3013,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.28,Pours a very cloudy golden color with a thick foamy head. Head retention is good. Lacing is very good. Juicy orange citrus aroma. There may be a hint of tobacco when colder but gone when warmer. Nice and juicy taste. Orange and tropical. Nice and smooth. Medium bodied with mild to moderate carbonation.
3014,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.03,Orange Bowling Ball. Poured into a KBS extended tulip.
3015,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.68,"Pours pale yellow with a 2 inch white head, which lasts. Moderate lacing to the end. Aroma is intensely floral, pine, grapefruit, mango. Taste is malty, pine, grapefruit, mango. Delicious, resinous goodness. Medium bodied, light carbonation. Dry, bitter finish. Outstanding! One of the best DIPA's. The aroma alone is to die for."
3016,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.75,Amazing diverse stout. Was able to get some of the original and variants last April during Hunahpu event. Excellent beer. Going to Tampa 6/26 and will get some more!
3017,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.46,"Pours pale hazy yellow, white thick frothy head. "
3018,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.55,"Served on tap in a 10 oz (296 ml) snifter at Beer Noggin in Bronxville, NY."
3019,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.5,This one required at least four months bottle aging to round off the heat. But after that it's a mighty fine brew.
3020,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.44,Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head. Mild sour fruity aroma. Taste is a moderate tart sour fruity that has little harshness at the end. A very pleasant sour.
3021,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.44,"I've only had this at Extreme Beer Fest. I wouldn't usually go for something like this, but it is legend. My endorsement of it is that I immediately got back in line for another taste, which I didn't do for too many others at Extreme."
3022,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.77,"I had a few beers in my time, but this one is from outer space. Never had anything similar or one that came close. This is a dessert on its own. Chocolate strawberries and some nice bourbon boozy-ness. Well done for sure and probably worth the hype."
3023,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.44,"16oz. can into Night Shift stemware. Shared with schen9303.  Pours a nice, luxurious head with great retention. Deep, slick color. Nose is milk chocolate, fudge and cream. Very aromatic. Simple but this is exactly the aroma I expect from the style. Beer opens soft and almost pillowy. I get notes of sweet soy sauce, chocolate, fudge and roasted malt. A nice creaminess in the middle with some vanilla and molasses. Ends more sweet soy sauce and almost a touch of tartness from the roast. Very solid. Body is medium with low carbonation. Slick but fluffy on the palate and goes down oily with a long, lingering finish. This one drinks much bigger than it is... which is great.  A really great beer but I've come to expect this from this style at Tree House."
3024,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.66,Just an absolutely amazing beer... Coconut and caramel boom off of this! Rich and thick... the coconut is so delicious... pairs perfectly with the booze...  I love Fremont's work... they make amazing beers and this is no exception...  Highly recommended if you can acquire it!
3025,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.44,"Unfortunately, I rushed this taste a bit. Dark pour with a little tan head to it, this beer had a nice cinnamon backbone which ran from front to back, with the peppers adding some grip and texture. Well-structured and put together."
3026,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.22,"We're finally at the last new beer from my latest Tree House run. As far as their stouts go I've mostly had only a few of their milk stouts, and only 1 imperial stout before this. Let's see if this one can hold a candle to the likes of Moment Of Clarity Pours completely pitch black with a thick finger of dark espresso colored head that slowly fades to and ring and leaves great lacing, especially for the abv and style This beer has an aroma that toes the line between decadently sweet and firmly roasted. I'm picking up on aromas of nutty espresso, milk chocolate fudge, creamy vanilla, medium roast coffee, and a touch of dark fruit, mostly raisin Following suit taste-wise, this starts off very sweet, but leaves long contemplative aftertastes that suggest an aggressive yet classic stout. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting rich milk chocolate, creamy coffee, deep black cherry, and caramel. The swallow brings notes of sweetened espresso, raisin, dark chocolate, dark toast, and chewy caramel A full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a creamy and chewy beer that needs some time to go down. Finishes mostly dry surprisingly with waves of sweet and roasty weaving in and out Another winner from TH. A bit heavy at times, especially up front, but once you get past that it's smooth sailing. I'd get it again along with some other variants"
3027,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.75,"Pastry stout delight! Poured very dark with a mocha head into a Torst glass. Expected this to be more like motor oil but it wasn’t. Aromas of fudge and subtle coconut release from the glass. Smells like dessert! Flavors are insane. Pretty sweet with fudge brownies, coconut and subtle Barrel/oak. Amazing flavors here. Like I’m sipping on brownie batter. Feel is viscous and mouth coating. Pretty sticky. Overall, this was a treat. Dessert in every way!"
3028,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.22,"Thank you, Tomme. Cherry red with a thin, white head, this looks nice. The nose has a big red cherry character, ripe, fruity and sweet. The base sour has a nice lemony aroma. Moderately chalky and mineraly, this smells bright and refreshing."
3029,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.72,Beautiful pitch black pour with a moderate khaki head
3030,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.4,"Canned 11/11/20. ""How gggreen are you?"" stamped on the bottom Coming to this one fresh off the heels of the base beer, Green, which I wasn't all that impressed with. This one isn't quite as acclaimed, but still sits at #131 of all time on this site. Also ironic that a beer named ""Gggreennn!"" is beer #420 for me Pours a hazy radiant goldish orange with 2 fingers of white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing Despite being about a week older than the can of Green I had, this smells even more fresh than that did. The aroma seems more tropical here, lots of cantaloupe, mango, pineapple, papaya, and tangerine backed with oily hops and biscuity malt The taste starts off with loads of citrus, orange and pineapple with some tart lime in the background, as well as oily hops. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit rind, pale malt, tangerine, and resinous hops. A bit more balanced than the base beer despite the extra hopping Just like the base beer in feel, medium in body, except with just a bit more carbonation for a zippy feel. Finishes mostly dry and bitter Definitely better than Green itself. Funny, I didn't see the same thing with Julius vs Jjjuliusss!, where the base beer was miles better. Regardless, both good beers. I'm sad to have made it through all the reviews for my case from Tree House, but I suppose I should get back to reviewing other styles :)"
3031,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.44,"look: pale orange, hazy but feels like you can still see thru smell: floral and honeydew taste: floral, honeydew, some strange bitter taste, seems too piney / grapefruit / dank feel: creamy and easy chugging, only the aftertaste is really bitter overall: good but seems overrated"
3032,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,3.97,"Bottom of can is stamped 3/1/21. I assume (hope) that's a borned-on date. Massive, stupid creamy head on this thing. Real nice lacing too. Honeyed-orange body reminds me of Two-Hearted and that's a definite plus. All in all, one of the prettier pours I've seen in a minute. Nice fresh hop scents; resinous pine with a bit of citrus. A lotta malt sweetness too. Smells nice. Taste follows, but it's a little muted. Hmmm, maybe that was a best-by date? I don't hate this by any stretch; what's there is well-balanced and tasty. Just doesn't taste fresh to me. Feel is soft and creamy; slightly oily on the back end. Minimal carbonation and just a hair shy of medium-bodied. Crossed the border into Ohio for cheaper gas the other day and found this in the cooler. I'll have to make that trip again some time and keep an eye out for fresh stock."
3033,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.0,"On tap @ The Festival 2014. Black pour with a small layer of tan foam. A lot of rich, spicy coffee on the nose. Slight vanilla and caramel sweetness. Roast, cocoa powder, and a mild nuttiness. Flavor has a moderate bitterness of coffee, roast, and cocoa. However, a nice sweet balance to it. Plenty of caramel and dried blueberry. I liked this more than the maple one."
3034,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.16,"I may have a soft spot for this one since I have visited Mackinac Island up in MI and love the fudge, but all the flavors come out in this one. Top notch!"
3035,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.28,12 FL. OZ. bottle
3036,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.33,"On the taste, first noticed spice, with a bit of booze, bready yeast with a hint of fruitcake/fig and some coffee. High carbonation and light mouthfeel. Very nice."
3037,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.5,"Cantillon Blabaer Lambik Vintage 2015. Acidic, tart, funky, and tannic on the palate. One of the best uses of blueberries in any beer I have had.  Overall, a really nice fruited beer that requires far too much effort to acquire. Your life will not be worse without it."
3038,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.57,"No date on the can, but this one's pretty fresh. Really excited to finally get to try this New England Classic. Pours a deep, hazy orange with gobs of white head that rise up to about two fingers above the beer. As it settles, huge amounts of froth cling to the inside of the glass, while its weaker counterparts slip helplessly into the beer itself. As warned, I got my fair share of sediment in this can as well. No harm no foul. Sweet, dank nose on this. Tons of herbal, grassy, piney hops compliment an abundance of grapefruit aromas. Really great contrast of sweet citrus and pithy hops, with a complex aroma that really embodies every great quality of a true, ""old school"" American Double IPA. A re-emergence of similar qualities that were found on the nose... Sweet, juicy grapefruit, herbal hops, and some awesome fruity undertones reminiscent of pineapple. This beer is so incredibly well-rounded and is able to achieve an immense juiciness while also retaining a punishing hop presence that lingers in all the best ways with that pithy, bitter tail. Surprisingly soft mouthfeel, with a low, almost forgotten carbonation that sneaks up on you a little more with each sip. A subtle boozy warmth accompanies a great residual mouth-coating and a smooth, crisp finish."
3039,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.56,"Pours a hazy yellow color with only a few fuzzy bubbles on the surface. Aroma is fresh, unripened nectarines, grapefruit pearl, lemon, and fresh oak, and some granny smith apple. Taste is like biting into a fresh nectarine that is more tart than juicy. There's a little acetic acid and band aid as is common with De Garde. It has a full flavor while maintaining a light airy freshness throughout. I get a rich, white wine note as it warms along with grapefruit pith and sour lemon candy. Carbonation is minimal but just enough to move the beer along. It's very esay to drink the 750 in one sitting. This is a fantastic beer."
3040,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.77,"A: A deep red, almost purple. White head that sticks for a while. S: Blackberries and a lot of them. Oak, hay, lemon zest, vinegar. T: Yep that's perfect. Juicy blackberries, tart blackberries. Some oak to dry the back end and that signature SP tartness/sour to let you know it means business. M: Enough carb to make it palatable, but not a lot to make it soft. Oak dryness on the backend end. O: This is killer. I've had a few SP bottles now and this one is amazing. Not the most sour of the bunch, but very complex and well balanced"
3041,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.38,"16oz. can into a Heady Topper stemless snifter. Shared with schen9303.  Probably the muddiest NE IPA I've seen to date. Nose is pineapple, mango, papaya and citrus. Super juicy and dank. Heavily aromatic. Outstandingly enticing. The aroma is as good as the look is bad. Beer opens citrus and pineapple. A good bit of acidity followed by some pulpiness and fresh fruit juice. Mango and melon in the middle with bright citrus fruit swirling around those flavors. Finishes with more fresh pineapple and orange. Juicy finish. Body is medium with moderate carbonation. A little prickly in the mouth and goes down sparkling and aggressive. Dry yet juicy finish that coats the palate and lingers. Nice but I wish this was a touch smoother.  This is easily one of the most memorable IPAs I've had from Trillium which is saying a lot. Definitely worth seeking out."
3042,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.53,"2014 vintage. Enjoyed on 11/30/19. This one has aged perfectly. May be considered a quad, but this is completely #BiL after 5 years of aging. Toffee, caramel, creme brulee, Werther's originals, molasses, bread pudding, bourbon-soaked raisin, date, prune, charred oak, smooth bourbon, vanilla, and leather. Wayyy better than I expected. Ages extremely well."
3043,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.32,"A 1 pint can, canned on 26th July 2017. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass. Appearance: A hazy dark yellow orange colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly and left only sparse lacing. Aroma: Orange, mango, peach and pineapple with hints of honey. Taste: Pretty much follows the aroma with mango, peach, pineapple, orange rind, grapefruit and light floral notes. Good balance of light sweetness and light bitterness. Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium to full bodied with moderate lively carbonation. Overall: An excellent DIPA with a good balance of sweet and bitter and nice tropical and citrus fruit, aroma and taste."
3044,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.6,"Appearance: This beer pours an opaque black with burnt sienna around the edges when held up to the light. A light brown, two finger, fluffy head with tightly packed bubbles nearly disappears with a thin ring around the edge of the glass. No lacing on my snifter as I drink the beer.  Smell: The first thing to hit my nose is syrupy sweet honey right out of the fridge, morphing into toffee and caramel as the beer warms. Smooth bourbon notes of vanilla. A deep, dark bready malt profile with dark dried fruit aromas of raisin and some brighter plum.  Taste: This beer is beyond reproach. The malt profile of the Barleywine, the bourbon, and oak distinctly shine through as separate entities, all while melding to create the perfect marriage of flavors. It is the Mother of All Perfect Storms as these various flavors come together. This is not a beer trying to be something else, like so many are.  Complex and multi dimensional. On the tip of the tongue is sweet dried dark fruit including raisins and dates. Followed in the middle by milk chocolate and cocoa powder, vanilla, toasted coconut and smooth bourbon. After the waves of this storm subside I’m left with a long finish of a semi-dry, oak-forward beer with a slight alcohol hint. Not loving this, but as the beer warms it really opens up nicely and these mid palate dry and woody notes phase out and it becomes a perfect marriage of sweet Barleywine, bourbon and oak. A hint of alcohol to remind you it’s a 14% beer but never distracting.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation. Super smooth. Warming on the palate and in the pipes. Sweet and sticky residue left on my lips.  Overall: This beer is a gem. Plain and simple. One of the best, if not the best Bourbon barrel aged Barleywines I’ve ever had."
3045,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.52,"I received a can of this famous Porter from @Roy_Hobbs. Canned on 5/18/2021. Poured at 59° into a Willi Becher pint glass. It pours nearly black with very dark cola hues at the bottom of the glass when held to the light, with a large, fluffy, medium khaki-colored had and thick creamy lacing. It's a beautiful pour. Its fragrant nose features dark chocolate, cigar smoke, burnt coffee grounds and charred nuts. Wow, the taste is amazing! The initial chocolate malt sweetness is juxtaposed to acidic coffee (like it's from a Jersey diner), and bitter, earthy, nutty char. There is also strong tobacco. The blend and balance of flavors are exquisite. The mouth feel is rich and creamy - almost stout-like - with mild carbonation, and the 7% ABV seems perfect. Everett is highly drinkable but with excellent substance. This Porter is big and flavorful enough to pair with a fine meal of roasted red meat but you could easily drink a couple of pours casually. Everett's 100 Score is well-deserved. It's as good an American Porter as you'll have the great pleasure of drinking."
3046,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.5,"Pours a an apple juice gold with a 1/2 inch off-white head. Smells hoppy, piney, has a nice balance of malts as well. Taste certainly follows the nose, the balance between the bitter hops & sweet maltiness really couldn't get better. Medium-full bodied, moderate carbonation, chewy, heavy, finishes smooth. Another really good IPA from bells. Slightly higher ABV than the two-hearted ale."
3047,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.77,"Tasted from can. Pours dark brown with tan head. Lots of maple and coffee on aroma. Taste is sweet with a chewy and sticky mouthfeel. Flavors of maple syrup, molasses, coffee. Awesome breakfast style stout."
3048,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.55,"Really hazy yellow color with short live off-white head. Aroma has intense juicy fruits like ripe peaches, apricots and mango. Taste follows with sweet and juicy fruit notes, some biscuits, a hint of vanilla, slightly astringent on the finish with a light bitterness. Medium plus body with medium carbonation. True hop juice."
3049,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.0,"Traded for this a while ago, as there wasn't a date on the bottom of the can. Wasn't sure what to expect out of this as the beer was quite old when I finally cracked it open, and although it wasn't bad, I don't see how it earned the lofty rating that it had on here... The pour to this was alright as the liquid had a orange blossom hue to it with plenty of white, bubbly head to top it off. Most of the thin lacing was around the top of my pint glass with a few scattered splotches below it. Lots of citrus juice and rind in the nose with some dank, tropical notes and pine as well. It wasn't bad but at this point, I've had so many beers with those notes that this seemed like something else I've had before but couldn't quite remember exactly what. That characteristic was true for the taste as well given how slick, sweet, and somewhat heavy this was but once again, it wasn't anything noteworthy or outstanding to me, as the malt was certainly there but not anything that added or detracted to this beer's flavor profile... The amount of alcohol in this was typical as well with just enough to give this some heft but not enough to easily felt or detected. A date on the bottom of the can might have helped but as it was, I would love to give this another go with something fresher. A mild, dry hop burn took hold as I finished this off and there was just a little bit of sediment at the bottom of the liquid but as it was, this was a beer that was as prototypical as a New Englad IPA could get..."
3050,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.43,"Poured from a bomber to a pint glass. 2019 vintage. Appearance: Super dark brown while pouring. With aggressive pour, kicks up a huge light brown head. Body is basically solid black. Smell: Port barrel, dark chocolate, smoke. Taste: Wow. Very dark charred grain, burnt sugar, port wine, maybe some herbal hops or is that the licorice? Very big and dark beer. Feel: Surprisingly not that heavy. Fairly clean and lightly carbonated except for a dry roasty finish."
3051,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.85,"One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Went to Trillium over the weekend and tried all the beers on the tap line including Upper Case. Along with Permutation 52 (mentioned in other review), this was my favorite beer of the bunch. All the others were amazing too (including Meddle at a close runner up), but this one had more complex flavors and smell. A great NE IPA style, very juicy, and very smooth for the ABV level. I live in NYC and can say this stacks up very well with some of our favorites from Other Half, Sand City, LIC, etc."
3052,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.6,"Not quite as good as Bad Boy, but different and special in its own way. Another example of the great SoCal IPAs that have a lot of hops but still make them drinkable and enjoyable."
3053,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.41,"2017 bottling (I think), poured into Kane chalice and let warm for an hour L: Dark black with a light tan head. About 1F, not much retention. Leaves a thin light tan ring. S: Bourbon and barrel dominate the nose. Dark fruits and chocolate are minor notes. This beer probably needs to be aged. Too bad I could only get one. T: Bourbon and oak predominate taste as well. Still room for a near explosion of dark fruits (amazing) and some chocolate. Maybe a little bit of coffee. Slightly sweet and a little bit of heat from alcohol.  F: Less full-bodied than you might expect, closer to medium. Tiny bit of carbonation. Still very young and boozy. Balance still quite good for all that. O: It's great, but not top-tier, YET. If I find another one to age for three years, I have a feeling my score is going to increase."
3054,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,"Poured from a 3 week old can gotten from my daughter who mulled it from Boston. Thanks K! Poured into my Tired Hands teku glass.  L: A super cloudy medium golden with hints of orange color. Decent glass lacing they recedes.  S: Notes of huge tropical fruit with mango, pineapple, guava and some honey sweetness.  T: Fruity hops pound you with loads of tropical fruit. Pineapple, mango, guava, some slight citrus and a little bit if earthy herbal flavors. Sweetness comes from the honey as the finish turns fruity and dry. This is a great beer.  F: smooth, fruity and a bit of alcohol. Nice carbonation. O: I’ll say this only. Awesome beer, world class."
3055,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.23,"Canned on 05-20-21. A - Opaque light tan color with dense white creamy lacing. S - Not alot of aroma with spicy tropical fruit. T - Pulpy, vinous tropical fruit: pineapple and peppery spicy fruit rind. M - Thick mouthfeel that's pillowy soft. O - This is holding up extremely well for being (6) weeks old. The nose falls short but overall pretty impressive!"
3056,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,"16 oz can, dated 4/14/21, poured into a teku  A- A hazy golden straw with a two finger white head. S- Dank, lime zest, citrus, some pineapple, tropical fruits, melons, touch of peaches. T- Citrus, dank, some lime zest, melons, some tropical fruits, touch of pineapple. M- Smooth, a little creamy, medium body. O- A well brewed and easy to drink NEIPA. 8.5% is well hidden and doesn’t make this sweet."
3057,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.63,"L: Hazy yellow with a thick, creamy head and good lacing. S: Bright, pungent tropical fruit, grapefruit, a small amount of dank, pine, and a touch of spicy booze. Some subtle pale malt in the background as well. T: Firm but mild bitterness upfront, moves into a huge wave of citrusy tropical fruit flavors. A piney resinous edge to the flavor as well as some peach notes. The malt flavor is surprisingly full and provides a good base as well as a bit of sweetness to support the hop flavors. F: Full bodied but still a drying finish. Overall: A full on juicy hop experience with surprising complexity for a single-hop beer. Everything works perfectly to create a supremely balanced and drinkable ale."
3058,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.9,"Vintage 2014. Pours translucent rust, dark copper with a khaki head that eventually disappears completely leaving no lace. The smell is of stone fruit, caramel and cognac. The taste is sweet and complex with caramel, toffee, vanilla, dates, burnt sugar, raisin and toasted bread. Full texture with low carbonation. Admittedly sweet but, so many different flavors blending together in glorious harmony. Instantly one of my all-time favorites."
3059,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.74,"I'll begin this review by stating that I am not a barleywine guy. Revoke my membership to BiL, because I'm not worthy. But, Jesus, if you don't like this beer, your Craft is Life membership should be revoked. A Deal with the Devil (Double Oak) has a strong caramel nose - tasting notes include rich caramel, quite a lot of barrel, a bit of malt, chocolate notes, and a lot of richness. It's quite sweet, but with the balance of the barrels, it's very drinkable and finishes quite cleanly. Again, I'm no barleywine fan boy - but A Deal with the Devil is fantastic."
3060,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.46,"Pours an opaque orange with nearly two fingers of white foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is orange, papaya, pine, dank, and tangerine, mingling tropical fruit juice with biting Northwest hops. Wheaty, biscuity, toasty malts shine through in the middle. Flavor profile is orange, tangerine, papaya, peach, pine, and light dank. Aside from the abundant hops, wheat and biscuity malts show through. Mouth feel is lightly effervescent with a chalky, grainy texture. It has a medium viscosity. Overall, flavorful and dense, bit less juicy and smooth from other Trillium offerings.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can."
3061,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.57,"Shades of lemon and gold capped by a solid two fingers of eggshell white head that settles nicely leaving cave pattern drawings in its wake. Aromas of honeysuckle, pine, apricot flesh, pineapple, light malt, and lemon zest. Taste follows with piney notes up front, pineapple juice in the middle, a bit of orange peel on the back, as well as the slightest hints of peach. For the amount of hops used in this beer, they're integrated seamlessly. It coats the palate; soft up front, creamy in the middle, and finishes somewhat dry. I could drink this one all day long. Superb."
3062,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.52,Serving: Bottle
3063,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.74,2014 vintage
3064,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,5.0,"Pours a light yellow gold with a large white fuzzy head that dissipates almost instantly. On the nose, funk - barnyard/hay, cheese, lemon - this is one complex nose. On the palate the lemon and green apple balances nicely with the more funky elements. It is slightly bitter and acidic on the finish. Again, it's very complex. Medium bodied and dry with nice carbonation. Overall, a stellar gueuze!"
3065,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.23,"Appearance - The poured the color of apple juice with visible carbonation, but little head.  Smell - The nose was very tart, and had fruity notes that I could not attach to a fruit.  Taste - The initial impression was sour apples. Later notes of guava andvpeppery spice were identifiable. As the taste progresses, it seemed to become more acidic.  Mouthfeel - The body seemed thicker than the average sour, which I found impressive.  Mouthfeel - I enjoyed this sour, but I think scarcity drives the score. Russian River makes better sours than this one."
3066,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.52,"Look: This beer pours an opaque, hazy, golden yellow white grapefruit juice color. It does not have that murky, pond water unattractiveness that comes along with some NEIPA. No visible carbonation. A fluffy white head that sits a finger high in my stemmed wine glass, settling down to a thin layer across the top while leaving a thick blanket of lacing in its wake.  Smell: Meaty and cheesy upon first whiff, with some green, dank, grassy and even skunky notes. As the beer sits for a few minutes the tropical juice notes really come out, including mango, one of my favorite IPA aromas described as crushed sweet tart candy. Orange citrus. There is a sweet bready malt aroma.  Taste: Up front orange citrus, followed by tons of berry including blueberry and strawberry. Sweet, bready malt flavor. The beer pleasantly bitters out mid-palate, with lingering notes of fresh cut grass, grapefruit juice and a pithy dryness.  Mouthfeel: Moderate level of carbonation. Super smooth and creamy.  Overall: It’s been a while since I’ve had a Hill Farmstead IPA and this is freaking fantastic. I love the creamy, candy and tropical fruit juicyness up front balanced out by the grassy, pithy and dry bitterness on the finish. Tons of berry flavor which was unexpected and thoroughly enjoyed. Complex and multi-layered flavor profile. A highly enjoyable drinking experience."
3067,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.57,Pours dark chocolate in color. Aroma is the bigges vanilla ever. Flavor is vanillla upon more vanilla. This is a vanilla milk shake. Body is a little thin but overall pretty fantastic.
3068,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.71,"09/2013 - always a consistently elegant, complex, and just damn delicious lambic; the grape pops everywhere, classic cheesy funk; dope as fuck from beginning through the finish, no matter the vintage."
3069,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.44,"Pours a dark nutty brown with mild fog. Head is a finger and a half of tan foam that bubbles away quickly. Aroma is cherry, Pinot noir, with a earthy, bready malts and stone and cellar notes. Flavor profile is cherry with stone, cellar, Pinot noir, berry, and bready malts. Mouth feel is bubbly and effervescent with a medium thickness. Overall, big depth with a little sour zing and a sweet wine pop. Well aged, considering this was bottled March 12, 2019, and reviewed/consumed on May 22, 2021.  Served in a stemless wine glass from a 375mL bottle."
3070,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.5,"2018 vintage on tap in Boise, ID. Dark mahogany pour, capped with a cream off-khaki head. Big, sweet aromas of malt and spirit barrels...big impressions of caramel and toffee, dark fruits and malt sweetness. Booze is subdued at this age. Oak and coconut and chocolate as well...toes the line between a Belgian quad and a barrel-aged barleywine. Loved it."
3071,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.32,"Bottle pour at Woodshop 8 held at The Hermosillo in Los Angeles, CA. Pours a murky reddish-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, cherry, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet and sour cherry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a fantastic balance of sweet and sour cherry flavors that make this one a real treat to drink."
3072,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,5.0,"(2018 Bottle) A: Poured into a snifter glass. Pitch black in color, almost no head to be seen. Good lacing left.  S: Dark fruit, bourbon, marshmallow.  T: Boozy chocolate, bourbon, roasted marshmallow, vanilla. There's some nuttiness, especially in the finish where the vanilla shines through alongside. Coconut comes in too. Wow.  M: Fluffy, smooth, and velvety. Such a perfect consistency and what I look for in any BBA stout.  O: This is now my favorite BBA stout, alongside Goose Island BCBS (maybe even a little better). The chocolate marshmallow bourbon flavor is just something you can't miss out on, and the consistency makes it all that much better. I don't know if I've ever said this, but this is a perfect beer."
3073,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.83,"From a 16 ounce can dated 12/10/2020, a short pour gets a yellow hazy straw color. Had a fabulous head on the second pour. I tried it straight from the can too. Its aroma favors an almost skunky citrus smell that is very inviting. The taste is grapefruit, lemon, orange and the right amount of bitterness that wanes as you drink more. The mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing straight from the can. This is truly a fine NEIPA. I hope I get the chance to try it again. A special thanks to @laketang for the heads up on getting this Focal Banger and a couple more in the process that I don't normally get in Texas. I will admit I enjoyed it more poured in the proper glassware. The aroma is extra special."
3074,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.74,"Enjoyed at the Copenhagen Beer Fest. Reviewed from notes. A - Poured a nice dark brown almost black with a thin mocha head. S - Aromas of HUGE coffee and cinnamon, simply bursts out of the glass. Just a little bit of chile.  T - Taste is similar to the nose. Superb coffee and cinnamon notes, little bit of heat, excellent chocolate and fudge. M - Mouthfeel is creamy, thick, crewy. Great body. O - Overall this was a phenomenal porter. The coffee and cinnamon here are just excellent. Big and bold.  Serving Type: on tap"
3075,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.65,"Not going to get to technical on this one. Dark, minimal head, smooth moderate to full mouth feel. That's said, big vanilla and bourbon on the nose, on the palate, forward and on the finish, awesome. Haven't had the base Vanilla Shake yet, but it's chilling in the cellar. Really looking forward to it even more now that I've had the BB edition."
3076,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.68,Really good stout.they actually fill barrels with maple syrup and clean them out to brew this beer. It’s really good and off the cellar menu at the brewery.
3077,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.5,"This has a beautiful apricot color with deep stone fruit flavor and refreshing medium mouth feel. It's very balanced and well made, just don't expect anything super complex. I don't see the need to pay the price to acquire this, but it's certainly a very good beer."
3078,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.71,Type: 375-ml. bottle
3079,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.65,"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. Look- Black, medium brown frothy head, above average lacing, below average head retention. Smell- Coffee, chocolate, oats. Taste- Coffee, chocolate, smoky oats, boozy. Feel- Full body, smooth finish, sticky coffee favor that lingers, syrup like, below average carbonation."
3080,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.6,Pours a meat black with a finger of mocha head.
3081,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.42,Poured at cellar temp into a teku. Bottle 74 Look:
3082,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.75,"On tap at Moeder Lambic, first one in a lambic glass, second in a tulip. Deep red with virtually no head. Mild cherry and lambic smell. Taste has a nice complexity that stands out even in the middle of a Zwanze day’s worth of cantillon. A real treat."
3083,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,3.05,"From a can with a couple weeks on it into snifter. Pours copper in color. Somewhat muddy? Piney. Resinous. Extremely hoppy but not well balanced with a malty backbone. Little alcohol burn but not overly flavorful. Astringent. Reminds me of the classic, overly hoppy west coast hop bombs but not as good. I don’t know. Still really like a classic west coast IPA but this one just doesn’t do much for me. Glad I was finally able to try it even if it was ultimately disappointing."
3084,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.33,Pours black with two fingers of khaki head.
3085,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,5.0,"This is another super rich imperial stout. Incredibly thick, black brew with minimal head/carbonation. Smells of bourbon and the wood flavor really comes through more than most RIS. It has this strong coating and chewiness as well. Absolutely spectacular among stiff competition."
3086,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.84,"by far the best beer with cinnamon I've ever had. Very thick, this was Batch 1 that I had. It was really well balanced, cinnamon wasn't overpowering."
3087,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.5,"On tap at Beer Shop, NYC."
3088,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.9,"Pours thick and black, with a thin dark brown head that fades to a dark brown ring around the glass. The aroma is chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. The taste is chocolate, marshmallow, vanilla, lots of barrel, but not boozy. There also seems to be some smokiness on the finish. It's a little on the sweet side, but not overly sweet. The mouthfeel is thick. Overall, this beer is a work of art. Like KBBS, I was worried that it was over-hyped, but, also like KBBS, that is not the case. This beer is as close to perfect as a barrel-aged stout can be."
3089,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.85,"2017 bottle. Great adjunct free ba stout. Picked up chocolate and dark fruit sweetness. Very balanced though, unlike purple Assassin that is all sweet dark fruit."
3090,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.71,"This bottle came out of left field - a tremendous and very welcome surprise. One of the newer members of our share group is a form member of the Urban Family team and has a deep selection of brewery bottles and west coast stuff - including, apparently, this specific bottle. The beer pours a light gold, mostly transparently, with a hugely funky nose. It's fairly sour and funky, with a medium mouth feel, and a bit of tartness. Slightly acetic, though my stomach had been suffering all evening long from sours. The finish does not linger, so it's fairly pleasantly clean. Fantastic - this stands up to hype and reputation. I'm quite thankful, having been able to try it."
3091,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.31,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass canned on 10/2/2020. Pours a hazy orange with nearly a 2 finger sticky white head that leaves thick streaks of lace with excellent retention. 4.75 Smell passionfruit, mandarin, pineapple, mango, and apricot. 4.25 Taste follows passionfruit, mango, mandarin, pineapple, and apricot really solid but honestly was expecting more. 4.25 Mouthfeel is bigger than average, a tad sticky but not dry, fairly soft carbonation, and at 8.4% ABV goes down very easy. 4.5 Overall this one is excellent, but I really was expecting more because I thought this would be one of the best from them and it is just really good. 4.25"
3092,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.53,"12.7oz bottle (2019 vintage) poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 12.1% ABV. The beer pours dense, very dark brown with chocolate tan colored head. The head builds slowly on a hard pour and quickly fades to a thin ring and tiny bit of lacing. The aroma is strong with bourbon first, then vanilla, cacao and spice. The taste is semisweet caramel and chocolate malts with big bourbon easing into nice pepper flavor and heat with the vanilla, cinnamon & cacao on the finish. Minimal bitterness as the spicy heat and drying barrel balance the big malt bill perfectly. The mouthfeel is full to medium bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, outstanding. This is a destination beer. So many things going on without being busy. No hint of alcohol as the habaneros & cinnamon mask what little might be there. Recommended if you enjoy spiced stouts along with bourbon barrel aging."
3093,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.6,2016 bottle (Batch 3) into Hill Farmstead flute bottle. Light amber in color with a good bit of foam head upon an aggressive pour. Wonderful floral aromas and taste. Fruity flavor. Brett is present but not offensive. Not overly tart or overly acidic. Very balanced saison that is pleasant and easy to drink. One of the best I've had.
3094,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.55,"Picked this up at Hyvee in Owatonna, MN for $18 for a 4-pack of 16oz cans. Canned on 11/18/20 and enjoyed in a snifter on 2/21/21."
3095,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.58,2015 Vintage
3096,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.68,"2018 batch from a 12 oz bottle. As advertised, the pry of the cap... nothing. As expected with an HotD special release, this is still. Burnt chestnut brown bordering black. Not a single bubble resides above, yet Adam From the Wood is beautiful. Despite a lack of pressure, the ability to deliver aromas upon relief of the cap is impressive. All the glorious elements that make up Adam (tobacco, leather, molasses, brown sugar), are met with a perfect, non-overpowering level of barrel influence. Lightly charred wood and decadent vanilla elevate Adam to the next level. Booze definitely plays a major role in the flavor. Figs wrapped in sopping tobacco leaves, flash charred, then lightly coated in milk chocolate. Oak and leather baseball glove ties that you've chewing on while playing right field for the last 6 innings linger in the end. But then, long after sips, a refreshingly light implication of Maraschino Cherry only adds to the complexities. Like I said, Adam kicked up a notch. The flavors sear into the taste buds. This is the weirdest and most wonderful aspect of this beer. It feels watery, almost too thin, like a sip of actual whiskey in fact, but only for a split second. I've never felt anything like it. It transcends into a silky, sweet, puckering mass with a blast of alcohol warmth. It coats everything it touches and sticks like glue. But then, full circle, the oak aging does a wonder of stripping the silkiness away. What can I say? It's phenomenal and a real treat. Added complexities to an already outstanding world class beer. Something I'll never pass up on given future opportunities. I'll leave it at that. Cheers."
3097,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.54,"I had this at the release on tap, along side Fen Tao, and later in the bottle. I have to say, on tap was better which is like saying the sky is blue. In my opinion, apricot is one of the best fruits to go with sour beers and this is definitely one of the better sours JK makes. Deep apricot flavor, medium sourness, all deliciousness."
3098,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.46,"Pours a clear crisp orange-yellow color with a thick but airy white colored head that laces nicely on the way down. Aroma of floral hops, earthy smells and some sweet malts at the end of it. Tastes of toasted malts, nice earthy and slightly citrus hops and a warming alcohol feel at the back end. Thicker feeling than it looks, warming, nice amount of carbonation. Overall, this is what I miss about Double IPAs made in New England."
3099,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.31,"Pours a medium yellow color, hazy. Amazing hop aroma - lots of tropical fruits: pineapple, guava, citrus. Wallop of dankness. Very flavorful, I get lots of pineapple, dank guava, light pone, lemon zest. Carbonation is appropriate, kind of thick feel. Overall an outstanding DIPA. 9/12/19"
3100,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.71,"On draft at Cycle. Pours pitch black with a ring of tan lacing around the edge of the glass. Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream are obvious on the aroma and taste. Each is distinct on it's own and they blend together beautifully. Doesn't taste artificial. Drinks rich, smooth, and sweet just like and ice cream sunday, but it's not just a one note dessert beer. Roasted malt comes in especially on the finish, and the barrel character is perfect for this style. The oak provides a subtle dryness on the finish that helps to balance the sweetness. The bourbon offers caramel, vanilla, and toasted coconut. There's a quiet burn mid palate and soothing warmth on the finish. The mouth feel is medium and sticky and coats the whole palate. This is one of the best Cycle stouts I've had. I was skeptical about strawberry flavor in a stout, but it was delicious. The various parts of this beer work really well together."
3101,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.44,"Opened 3-22-17 - Pours thick, oily black body with little movement. Still body drinks thick but not overly heavy. No head or carbonation, but it smells amazing. Coconut dominant, but not so much that you can't pick up the other flavors. Bourbon and cocoa round out the taste - really easy to drink."
3102,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.96,"I drank 3 Fonteinen Framboos a raspberry Lambic imported from Belgium, ABV 5.30%, in my backyard. It was truly delicious as well as thirst quenching (hot here), and my wife and my daughter who tasted it as well agrees with me. Lambic connoisseurs will love it and so will everyone else. This might be the best Lambic I've ever had. Look: red and pink murky with an 2-3 inch thick light pink head Aroma: tart raspberry Taste: The taste is raspberry, sweet and tart raspberry, maybe some lemon, but it is not too tart, just perfectly right, and a tad of yeast and oak and grass just to make it perfect. It leaves a long lasting flavor of tart raspberry which is very delightful. Body/Overall: Medium silky body"
3103,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.32,Pale amber with an cream colored head. Good lacing Largely floral slightly tropical and citrus with some slight toffee malt Toffee mango caramel and toffee popcorn. Delicious
3104,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.86,"Every TH beer seems to blend into each other. That’s what happens when the same yeast is in every beer. That being said, that means every product is solid. Haze...has a distinction. Really good, hazy style, but has a slight WC finish and bite. My favorite IPA I have ever had."
3105,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.64,"This is the 2021 vintage.  The presentation on this beer is top notch: a boxed 12oz bottle that feels super classy to open and creates anticipation as you read all the info written throughout. The label also provides some information such as how many cases were bottled, the degree of color, IBU, etc. This is a level of detail that I have not seen anywhere else, and really adds to the experience. The beer itself is a pure black color with a dark tan head that is not just frothy, but almost solid, and sticks around for a long time. Chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, leather, anise, some smoke, a hint of dark fruit like plum, some spice, hint of vanilla, and then the bourbon - not overpowering but just enough to assert its quality. Wood rounds this one out. Nothing overpowering, everything in its right place. Starts off with a bit of hoppiness actually, then covered quickly with roasted malt and coffee. Cherry and some other stone fruit. A hint of woodiness, spice, rum. Something sweet like coconut. Finishes with hints of leather and then a final boozy bourbon kick right at the end to remind you of the source of this treat. There is a lot going on here, but it all somehow comes together. I'd love to see some age on this, but this was a fun drink for sure. A really complex one, and I'm sure I haven't covered all that this beer has to offer. I will try to pick it up again next time!"
3106,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.43,"Typical Prairie stout appearance. The flavor is delicious, like one of the old 12oz bottles of BCBS. Coconut and vanilla are present but not overwhelming. Went back the next day for a second bottle after having this."
3107,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.23,Canned 11/21/17.
3108,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.76,"A beer that lives up to the reputation. I’ll get to the appearance at the end of the review, mostly because the smell and taste are the two most important parts of this beer and for one other reason. Smell is boozy barrel up front with a healthy amount of warm apple to round it out. Taste is more balanced, with the apple slightly leading the way and the boozy oaky barrel subtly surrounding it. Feel is medium bodied, neither oily nor thick-a perfect example of “just right”. Mouth watering, drinks more like a non-barrel aged 9 or 10% abv than a big bold 12.  My only problem, however, was evident right off the open and pour. I opened it and got hit with the apple and brandy before the cap came off, but I didn’t hear the usual noise one expects opening a beer, because the one I had had little to no carbonation. It has a nice dark hue with some brown edging, but there was no foam and very little lacing. If they date their beer with the first three numbers being the date, this was bottled 9/26/18. Doing a little online research, in October of last year, there was a release by Prairie that some of this beer was infected, so I don’t know if that’s the case here. But if this beer infected just means the loss of carbonation, I’d take an infected version of it over a lot of other beers out there. Because this is phenomenal! Long time want, glad I got it."
3109,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.65,Look: A deep reddish-orange hue.
3110,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.44,"Pours as dark as any stout I can remember. Mocha head with tight bubbles. Slightly metallic smell, not much else. Mouthfeel is fantastic, tastes coffee, toffee, peanut butter. Very, very good."
3111,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.7,25 May 2020 - Beer #103 - BA Top 250 Alert! Corona Day #74 Acquired via trade
3112,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.21,"From a 16oz can dated 11/12/19 into a pint glass. Pours a very murky, nearly opaque brownish yellow with about a finger of white head. Not much retention or lacing to speak of. Strong smells of pineapple and grapefruit. Taste follows the nose, mostly pineapple with some hop bitterness and citrus tang. Pretty soft mouthfeel. Overall, another great brew from Trillium!"
3113,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.44,330cl bottle poured into a tulip
3114,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.71,"The 2020 vintage is my first experience with Abraxas, though it was recommended to me in January 2019. However, it flies off the shelves. Eight 750 ml bottles where I bought mine from, and I bought two."
3115,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.34,Pours a somewhat hazy golden orange with a white head that dissipates rather quickly. It has a slightly piney smell with notes of mango and pineapple apparent. There are also hints of guava and a floral hoppy finish. The taste is dominated but the pineapple mango taste with a hoppy floral finish to keep it from being too bitter. It goes down incredibly easily for almost 11% alcohol. Overall a stand out beer.
3116,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.63,"16oz can. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It smelled of maple, chocolate, toffee and cream. Sweet chocolate and maple taste with a subtle coffee roastiness."
3117,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.7,"Such a fantastic beer. 2017 vintage, so about 26 months old. Standard stout appearance-dark, mild tannish lacing. Smell is roasty malt and a strong barrel presence. Taste is amazing. Perfect balance of dark malt and woody bourbon barrel. Notes of chocolate, espresso, dark fruitiness. Medium bodied, mouth watering, big booziness. Was a longtime want, and glad it’s an absolute winner."
3118,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.47,Fresh Can from jeffreed61. ~2wks. 
3119,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,5.0,"Another awesome IPA from Hoof.  Poured from the can into an HHB Teku. This beer is so fruity and juicy its unbelievable.  You'll never believe this is a 12% ABV beer, it finishes smooth.  Great hop flavors and aroma."
3120,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.86,Had this side by side with 2013 regular Cable Car and Veritas 012.
3121,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.41,"16.9 oz bottle from 03/2019. L: Light straw, big head with lots of carbonation."
3122,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.89,"7/17/2020 - Dark and rich, dry and roasty. Procured the 2016 Reserve edition in a 22 oz bomber. Poured into a snifter, the head dissipated quickly. Really hits my sweet spot with the dryness and roasted flavor. 1/27/21 - 12 oz bottle, born on 11/4/20, poured into a snifter at 52 degrees F:"
3123,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.49,"16oz can. Poured out a hazy, golden orange color with a small, white head of foam. It smelled of pineapple, orange and grapefruit. So much tropical sweetness with a piney bitterness and toasted caramel."
3124,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.0,"The first thing I said when I tasted this beer was ""pineappley goodness"", and I'll stick to that. The overwhelming flavor of this beer is certainly what you notice, but behind that, it's actually pretty balanced. I thought it was a bit less hazy than most of the recent ""New England-style"" beers, but I get why this is their main APA, and I'd bet it is one of their two or three biggest sellers too."
3125,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.47,The beer was black with a small beige head.
3126,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.51,"12 oz. bottle dated 7/7/19 Poured into Aslin anniversary glass and allowed to warm. L: Pours black, barely any light brown head, which doesn't last very long. No lacing or cap and ring. S: Fair amount of rum and rum cask up front, along with coffee and vanilla. A peppery hint as well. T: More rum and cask than I expected, but vanilla and coffee take over and then cocoa works its way through and lasts with the dab of chili heat through the finish.  F: Full-bodied, not much carbonation. Lot going on in this beer and it is all melded very well and balanced nicely, as neither the ABV nor the heat get out of hand on the finish and the progression of flavors is very nice. O: They're all great, but the complexity and competence may make this the best of the BOMB!s"
3127,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.79,"Love the super dry finish on this. Hazy, with a chance of juicy, a low amount of bitterness with a super dry finish makes me a happy Trillium drinker."
3128,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,5.0,"With a mouthfeel like rich, creamy, artisan chocolate milk, and not a hint of boozy heat in it's 13% ABV, this is without question the greatest coconut beer ever produced. If you love Last Snow, Fantastic Voyage or Death by Coconut, this beer is on a whole other level. You can even make a case that this beer might be the very best non-barrel aged adjunct stout every produced. Simply amazing."
3129,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"Had this almost a year ago. Was delicious. Great thickness, great mouth feel. Not hot. Great barrel taste. Smell was very nice, bourbon came through great. Great thick body"
3130,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.23,"This smells amazing but im not getting any barrel. It's very very subtle, this reminds me of what I'd want Big Bad Baptist to be, the coffee is super there but idk. I preferred the Mackinac Fudge one. This is definitely top notch, ill have to try it again I think. This one hundred percent tastes and feels great regardless I guess I was just hoping for a smidge more balance but who knows maybe next bottle. Definitely still a nice treat it just tastes a ton like breakfast stout, could have used a smidge more barrel/boozy undertones"
3131,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.88,"NOW we're talking!!! Poured this and honestly thought it was a hazy NE IPA. Absolutely beautiful to look at. Starburst orange color that just pops. Aroma is unreal....guava, mango and passion fruit galore. Taste is exactly as the nose....ALL THE FRUITS plus a side of tartness please!! Feel was spot on....dry yet refreshing. Could drink this ALL day!! Overall, this is THE BEST berliner I've ever tasted."
3132,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.41,"Bottles at the DC Lambic & Sour Tasting on April 14, 2012. Served in a Lost Abbey Teku. Big thanks to Brad for acquiring two different versions of this rarity. The first was an unlabeled version that was allegedly dubbed ""too sour"" and not released. The second was the labeled version available at Toronado. The review that follows is of the ""regular"" version from Toronado. After that are some notes on the unlabeled version in comparison to that one. Gusher alert! Holy hell did this thing explode. Even after being stored cold and opened right out of the fridge, as soon as the cage came off the cork started pushing up and beer shot out sideways several feet. Thankfully we were mostly prepared, as had we not been ready I think we would have lost the whole bottle. After all that, the beer pours a hazy and murky reddish-amber with a small off-white head that recedes pretty quickly, leaving just a bit of sparse lacing behind.  The nose carries heavy notes of cherry with a bit of nutty pit in there, though just a touch. Behind that is a really nice bit of earth and some very light barnyard. The flavor was similar and brought plenty of cherry along with some light funk and moderate acidity.  Body was medium with average carbonation and a dry finish. Really a lot more depth to this one than with the 2010 Cable Car that we had alongside the two Kriek versions. Compared to the regular version, the ""too sour"" unlabeled version did not have nearly as much cherry and had quite a bit more acidity. The cherry that was there seemed to be more of a sour cherry, and there weren't nearly as many earthy notes. This reminded me much more of the Cable Car with cherries added, whereas the labeled version seemed like a different beer. Very interesting comparison. Thanks again, Brad."
3133,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.97,"2015: 4.9 Best stout I've ever had. Luscious, thick, crazy nose. Like smelling flavors of a good whisky....some heat, then fudge, then caramel, then vanilla. Amazing beer. Aftertaste is of honey and coats your tongue. Certainly sweet but great flavors where the barrel cuts the sweetness of the base stouts. Had side by side with Assassin 14 one time; Killed it. and way better then 2018 SR. I think this beer was a happy accident that they will never recreate.  2018: 4.14 Different beer. Still thick, still fuggy, weird metallic after taste. Doesn't have the same nose, more of a thick super sweet stout. The fudginess and mouthfeel are the redeeming qualities, but a different beer than 2015. Good stout, but not worth the price and wouldn't even compare to Batch 1."
3134,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.64,Very Dark brown with a tan head. It appeared to be less thick on the pour particularly compared to Man Bear Pig which we had drank before this beer.
3135,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.6,"Poured moderately hard from a bottle into a snifter glass, barely resulting in a bit of brown head that faded soon. Color was practically black, even while pouring. Smells of chile peppers and a bit of chocolate. Taste is a background of rum, some cocoa, and mild chile peppers with mild heat. Not enough heat to leave my mouth warm though. Medium to thick bodied with light carbonation. Can't tell it's 15% ABV, but definitely strong. Amazing stout as usual from Prairie, wish there were more rum barrel stouts like this."
3136,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.2,Hoppiness comes through loud and clear. Not excessively bitter. Not chalky. Pineapple and other citrus on the palate. More spiciness and resin on the nose.
3137,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.68,"You taste the dark malt, dark chocolate and booziness upfront, with dark fruit, molasses and maple syrup finishing up with a mild bitterness at the end that lingers. It has a viscous mouthfeel that completes the experience. Nicely done."
3138,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.75,"First of all, the smell. Wow! Hits your nose and you don’t want to pour it, drink it out of the bottle! My friend I’m drinking it with said it tastes like a raspberry Flintstones vitamin. It’s a great one no doubt!"
3139,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.42,"Pours pitch black, nearly impervious to light. Dark mocha head dissipates fairly quickly. Big roasted malt aroma, some chocolate, burnt coffee. Flavor is massive milk chocolate, chocolate syrup, light coffee, sweet and malty, lactose rounds it off with a touch of sweet creamy vanilla. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a very good milk stout, very similar to Kane Evening Bell, but better. 12/15/19"
3140,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.8,"Pitch black with a reddish pink brown beige head of one finger. Bourbon, coconut, vanilla and chocolate creme. Smells like that amazing suntan lotion on the beach. Tastes of chocolate, coconut cream, chocolate icing, bourbon, vanilla, all to perfection. Medium light body with moderate carbonation.  I got this in Waynesville NC, and am drinking it in Redding, September 23rd, 2020. One of the best beers ever."
3141,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.14,All about the hype but this one is a little overrated. Generous scores based on the brewery it comes out of. Was probably world class in 2011 but not so much now. It's very one dimensional.
3142,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.64,"Juicy, dank and delicious.  This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego. It is intensely kettle and dry hopped to produce a pungent and flavorful double IPA that is super pleasant to drink. It is simply and easily described as a juicy and dank citrus bomb."
3143,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.42,"From a 16oz can, dated 11/11/20. Served in an IPA glass. Pours an only moderately hazy, translucent amber-gold with two-plus fingers of beautiful, pouffy white head. Retention is excellent, leaving a fat, whipped foam cap and gobs of merengue-like lacing. Smell is sharp and forest-like, sandalwood, pine tips and pitch. Taste is clean and malty, chewy biscuit, pine bark and lemon peel with a deep, soul-satisfying sprucey bitterness. Feel is clean, crisp and quenching, medium-plus bodied with ample fine, prickly carbonation. Overall, an excellent beverage. A bit of a throwback - not wc turpentine-level piney bitterness but definitely not a doughy, fruity contemporary NEIPA either. Pure Goldilocks. (Replaces a 4.28/5 rDev on 10/22/15 rating-without-review)."

3145,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.78,"Sixty-five degree weather, maple leaves losing their color, and one of those tough “my kids started virtual learning because of covid” weeks - perfect time for a deep oil brown/black elixir. This stout has barely a head when poured, quickly subsiding and releasing strong smells of coffee, burnt sugar, chocolate. Superbly controlled on the taste and the finish. There’s a bubbly mouthfeel which is refreshing. The sweetness of the maple syrup comes through, especially since our pairing was with a walnut maple ice cream."
3146,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.61,"It is truly a beautiful rich and bright amber color in an eight ounce serving, inside a clear glass. There's a nice tight white head that seems to be perpetual. Despite the brightness and near translucenty, this has some body. Look at the lacing inside the glass, Wow! The aroma is of a good piney and biting hoppiness, but it's not overpowering. The taste is just about West Coast IPA perfect. That means there's a solid, but not sweet, malt body cleanly carrying a poignant resinous, yet dry bitter hop taste. Nothing out of whack, delightful across the tongue, rare is the beer better than this. A necessary advisory, this is from Philadelphia, three thousand miles away. It certainly must taste even better on the other side of the country."
3147,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.71,"drank on 10/27/2016. latest batch Golden/yellowish, bright, nice head, beautiful Citrus, funky, oak, fruity Deep, lingering, tart, jammy goodness....follows the nose Tart but balanced. Crushable Excellent ""wild farmhouse"". Phenomenal beer I am so thankful to have gotten to try."
3148,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.19,"From a 16oz can, dated 10/15/18. Served in a Trillium-branded tulip. #properglassware Pours a massively murky glass of OJ with a scant finger of soft, creamy head. Retention is no better than so-so, leaving a pretty, creamy collar and a thin curtain of lacing. Robust nose of pineapple, weed and sexy, sweaty girl. Taste is massively dank and weedy, sort of a cross between ditchwater and bhang water. Wow. Give me a second here. OK. Super-juicy with overripe pineapple, orange rind, sweet, sticky, dripping peach, composty melon, guava, lime and macerated ditch weeds steeped in sexy sweat. A little composted-melon-rind-sour-booziness lingers on the palate and in the sinuses at the finish. Feel is thick and juicy, verging on sticky/syrupy, medium-hefty bodied and well carbonated. Drinks like a mixed-drink cocktail like they might serve you at brunch with a bamboo umbrella and a maraschino cherry. Whew. I've had Heavy Mettle a couple times before, maybe not since Canton opened? and somehow managed not to review it but is this the original recipe? Because it seems to me that the intensity dial has been cranked hard over to the right and jammed down with a brick. A) this beverage belongs in a 12oz can, and B) sweet fucking mercy, enough... uncle!!"
3149,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.39,Imperial Pale Ale does not mean IPA by default and this is a great example of how. Possibly worst beer name ever btw.
3150,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.09,"Stark black with a fuzzy mocha head settling to a persistent creamy blanket leaving minuscule tan spots on the glass.  Like many of Hill's non-adjunct barrel aged stouts, this is absurdly woody with a smoky hickory character. At the same time, it's easy drinking, as the smooth fluid light body delivers sweet chocolate and accents of ground walnut before finishing semi-dry. As it warms, creamy vanilla and some waxy oak develop before the warming bourbon exhale."
3151,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.99,"Best DIPA ive ever had. it is a hop monster but so drinkable, if it was available consistently it would dethrone Heady topper, which in my opinion is highly overrated."
3152,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.63,L - Cloudy dark reddish-brown. Frothy amber tinted mocha head..
3153,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.74,"A bomber bottle with no date visible poured into a snifter. Look- Thick dark black with a thin brownish head. Nice thin lacing that sticks a little.  Smell- Very complex smell. Starts with a strong aroma of maple syrup and chocolate. As it warmed, the barrel and coffee start to kick in slightly but not what I expected. Taste- Wow! Maple syrup up front with chocolate, vanilla, and a nice hint of bacon. The coffee wasn't there until the aftertaste. The maple and vanilla really stand out with everything else a side note. It was sweet without being overpowering. Mouthfeel- Little carbonation with a thickness that sticks to your tongue.  Overall- An amazing porter made for sipping. Each sip leaves you waiting for the next. Definitely going to look for this one again."
3154,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.68,Huge thank to BeerThursdays for this
3155,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.41,"Poured a hazy orange with nice lacing... small head .... tastes of honey, mango, light pineapple... very juicy and smells all same .... ever so slight bitter finish more sweet honey ... great overall beer and can’t wait for more .... first trillium experience and couldn’t be happier"
3156,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.81,2015 vintage enjoyed in december 2019.
3157,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.76,"Very creamy IPA. Nice hops golden color, hoppy, piney and floral smells coming off one this one. Hazy orange color. Love the light creamy fluffy feel on this one."
3158,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.84,"Wow, just wow. "
3159,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.66,"Jet black with a dark brown head that retreats to the edges of the glass. The aroma is an amazing blend of bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, raisins and caramel. The taste is exactly the same as the smell with the bourbon up front and the rest of the flavors coming in after that. There is a nice bitterness that lingers with the sweetness of the raisins and caramel at the end. Just a delicious stout."
3160,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.69,Canned 9/15/20
3161,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.69,"Pours a dense orange, quarter inch bubbly cap. Aroma is citrusy - I got my orange than apricot, though that is there as well. Palate has a great balance of tartness to the fruit notes - it isn’t super-lactic or puckering, but allows that orange & apricot to come through nicely with anchoring it with some tart funk. Finishes tart and crisp"
3162,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.71,"One of the best IPAs I’ve had. Would put this just below Perm 32 for me. I remember having Mosaic Cutting Tiles last year, and thought it was a mess. The new fermentation for these beers not only makes the hop flavors pop, but also smooths them out and they look great in the glass. Really, this is possibly the best looking IPA I’ve had. It’s looks like a puree of pineapples and oranges, and has a thick, sticky head. The taste is like 32, but a little more bite that I really liked. They’re knocking these beers out of the park lately."
3163,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.63,"My Dry January is over with this whale !! Canned 1/5/21, opened 1/28/21 “In this house we don’t slander Marcus Smart” Chilled 16 oz can poured into a Treehouse teku Two finger eggshell white dense foam cap. Looks like whipped egg whites.has more hang time than a Michael Jordan slam dunk. Reduces to a a Rocky Mountain island of foam over a hazy deep amber liquid after five minutes. Settles to a pencil thick layer after 10 minutes.Very good lacings, large and small bubbles  Fragrant on the pour.pineapple, tangerine, orange marmalade, orange blossoms, whiffof grass, whiff of earthiness,  Taste is citrus, pineapple, orange Velvety smooth , low sudsing, hop taste, no bite, the 8%abv is invisible  Great beer"
3164,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.38,"** Look: Super cloudy/ hazy and thick loom. Creamy light yellow (cream honey) color. Medium white soft creamy head. Excellent retention. Aroma: citrus, mango, melon, soaring soft fruit. Very nice. Taste: peach, grapefruit, melon. Grass finish. Very tasty. Feel: medium body, soft foamy, super smooth.  Lovely beer. Better than the OH copy/collaboration version i had a while back. **"
3165,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.47,"From a 16oz can, dated 09/15/21. Served in an IPA glass. Pours a murky, mucky orange juice color with two fingers of soft, lathery, cream-colored head. Retention is excellent, leaving a blanket of creamy suds and a heavy curtain of bubbly lacing. Aroma is sweet and fruity. Peach, pineapple and mango, cream and bubblegum. Taste is less sweet than the nose suggested. Earthy peach skin, orange pith and pineapple core bitterness is all messed up with dirty, raw hop grittiness. Sweet cream, orange, mango and herb. Feel is juicy, fluffy, fairly hefty bodied but lightened and brightened with plenty of fine, prickly carbonation. Overall, it bellies right up to the absolute utter brink of undrinkability, and takes a bare half-step back."
3166,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.49,550ml bottle poured into a snifter
3167,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.62,"Coconut snowflakes float along the surface of this pitch black beer. Thin, brown bubbles quickly retreat to the sides of the glass. Aroma is coconut cream, chocolate brownie, toffee candy, and bourbon soaked oak. Taste is more bourbon forward. Its a big, full bourbon flavor that seems to be evidence of time spent in the barrel. Rich dark fruit, vanilla, and toasted coconut reminiscent of the best bcbs vintages. It has some roast and smoke to it and that adds character. Coconut butter cream frosting is the icing on this chocolate cake. Mouth feel is full and carbonation is on point. This is almost a 4.75, but I prefer to see the base beer come through a little more. This is excellent and well worth the cost to acquire."
3168,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.78,"At 55 degrees pours jet black with the barest fizzy thin dark brown head; poor cap retention; thin ring disappeared quickly; small dots of lace with swirl; heavy long syrupy legs. Strong aromas of bourbon and maple, followed by vanilla and coconut; some booze on the retro nasal. Chillies pepper sauce, sweet maple, brown sugar; dark bittersweet chocolate, Baker’s chocolate; bourbon, vanilla and toasted coconut; dark fruit in the middle - plums and sugared raisins; finish is spicy chillies, bourbon and sweet maple. Medium body, smooth silky feel; light carbonation; pepper burn/alcohol bite all over tongue; warmth from 10.2% abv; not thick or adjuncty feeling. Overall, the “Mexican Cake” is solidly present with plenty of spicy chillies with a hot tamales sauce linger; and there is plenty of sweet maple and underlying chocolate to balance the heat; layers of barrel aromas/tastes of bourbon, vanilla and toasted coconut, and digging down, dark fruits; reminds me of CBS, and Morning Wood (without the adjuncts feel) for Maple content, but more complex which elevates into layers of bourbon and spicy peppers and barrel notes for a delicious slice of Mexican Cake drizzled with maple with two shots of bourbon poured on top for good measure!"
3169,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.77,"Cloudy vibrant orange with a finger of yellowed head. Thick rings of lacing. Clementines, light white pepper, vanilla and herbs in the nose. Lighter tasting than expected. Watered orange citrus and dull, piney, somewhat-chalky bitterness show the most when cold. As it warms, there’s a hint more vanilla and herb. Medium bodied, relatively slick, with moderate carbonation. Very pretty looking and decent-enough flavors, but it comes across dull and watered-down for an 8.5% beer."
3170,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.25,"750 ml bottle into snifter; 2018 vintage, bottle #4949. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small fairly dense khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Very mild herbal, grass, roast, charred bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, dark/brown bread/crust, vanilla, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a nice roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic, Minimal warming alcohol for 10%, with no lingering barrel booze after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged Russian imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the minimally bitter/tannic/drying finish. Fantastic soft feel. Not as much barrel as I expected, but adequate. Fantastic rich malt complexity; solid barrel presence/integration, restrained fruity yeast, and mild earthy hops. Not overly sweet/heavy from lingering dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and impressive spot on style example."
3171,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.98,The finest example of the style I've had since King Henry. This beer was a true delight and I'd recommend it to anyone. Well worth the effort to find one of these gems. The barrel flavor and mouthfeel on this beer was incredible.
3172,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.34,"Slight haze with a golden orange hue with a typical Alchemist unfiltered with detritus swimming about. The nose is large and overpowering in a good way - prepping your tastebuds. Spicy, piney, earthen, skunky weed and tropical fruit notes."
3173,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.68,"Ok, what do I know about rating beer. Julius was really delicious , drinkable, I wanted another after my first was polished off quickly. Hazy orange appearance with citrus tropical smell, taste was fuzzy orange with a mild kick , creamy frothy feel. Love !"
3174,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.14,"2020 vintage (released in 7/2020); consumed on 2/1/21 Pours an ink-black body capped with around a finger of creamy, pale mocha foam; decent head retention yields a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a minimal amount of spotty lacing holding to the walls of the glass. Aroma opens with charry roast sporting a boozy cherry essence before a burly bourbon character takes over; burnt vanilla bean offers a slight bittersweetness over the middle, while the back end of the bouquet highlights increasingly defined notes of dark chocolate, Raisinets, and suggestions of cherry liqueur. Taste brings forth a vivid expression of sweet, bourbon-imbued malts with some savory umami aspects; melted marshmallow, chocolate soft serve ice cream, with toasty malt tones interspersed between; sweet pipe tobacco and baked cacao over the mid-palate feed into darker brownie crust intermingling with persistent roast on the back end for a lingering bourbon barrel presence and touches of raisin past the swallow. Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body, slick upfront and with minimal carbonation; steadily roasty through the mid-palate and mildly warming into the back end, a deft, boozy heat meshes with subtle grit and distantly chewy textures to close; a surprisingly tame delivery for a barrel-aged stout, though overwhelmingly satisfying given its plush characteristics. Quietly unique in its extraction of the sweeter malt profile, this beer brings the notion of a cream stout to life with an amplified yet consistently roasty sweetness in tune with a pillowy body and casual warmth; balanced to near-sessionability for a brew of its ABV."
3175,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,5.0,"Decanted at 3F. Perhaps the perfect all-around lambic drinking experience. Visually stunning- amazing bouquet. Taste was incredibly well balanced. Blends 3, 5 and 6 were all great, but 3 was my favorite."
3176,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.49,"32oz ABC growler, served in a snifter glass 9/30/2015. Pours a lighter orange-copper body, clear with a remarkable amount of clarity; two finger white head with fair retention (given the growler serving) and very nice lacing. Looks like a West Coaster through and through. Smells of tropical fruit, dank durian fruit, pineapple, rich caramel malt, slight herbal character, a mild amount of spices to it. Deliciously balanced nose. Flavour is similarly excellent; rich tropical fruit, a bit of ripe pineapple and durian fruit, slightly funky and spicy, backed up by a rich caramel malt that is bold but not to the point of cloying or barleywine levels. Makes for a very balanced, complex and rich double IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, substantial, slightly slick and sticky but incredibly drinkable. Very mild heat to it. Overall, a very rich double IPA with a lot of interesting spicy and tropical fruit character to it. This is awesome."
3177,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.59,"Thick and creamy mix of cinnamon, pepper skins, cocoa, all spice, barrel and faint anise. Super smooth and a pleasure to sip on. Very flavorful and delicious. Pricey but I can see why. Excellent beer."
3178,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.67,"Chocolate, coffee, and bourbon all in one. The smoothness and ease with which it goes down is detrimental to your mental health with the 12% ABV. I am an IPA fanatic, but this one beats any IPA I have tried, hands down. Thank you Brewniverse in Shreveport, LA for carrying this."
3179,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.0,"2016 vintage; drank 4/21/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Brown/black appearance.  Big tan head; minimal lace.  Maple syrup, bacon & mild coffee notes in the nose; the name of this beer is spot on!  Medium mouthfeel.  Bacon & maple syrup flavors up front; mild coffee notes on the finish.  Not subtle at all, but if you like these flavors you'll like this beer a lot."
3180,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.74,"2016 vintage. This one pours a slightly hazy dark orange color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like funky pear, orange rind, citrus, white wine, barnyard funk, oak, lemon peel, funky hay, and a slight acidic bite. As expected, this is pretty much awesome. It's deeply funky, with citrus, lemon, lime, white wine, dry spice, oak, and pear skin. It's not necessarily better than the regular Oude Gueuze, but it's certainly excellent. This is light bodied, clean, and not super sour, with a good drinkability. This is so deeply funky and complex, but it also somehow remains fairly approachable. This is really quite excellent, and basically a pinnacle of lambic beer."
3181,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.5,"This is a creamier and danker version of the original Julius. Outstanding Hazy hops, but I think I still prefer the original Julius a little bit more. It might be nostalgia because that was such a great beer the first time I tried it at the old brewery. Will have to arrange a side by side someday to find out which really is better."
3182,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.66,"From a bottle produced 11/12/20. Pours black with a half inch of dark brown head. Smells of vanilla and roasted malt. Thick feel. Tastes of coffee, bourbon, and chocolate with some lingering bitterness. Excellent!"
3183,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.75,"My favorite IPA. Big fruit notes of mango, and passion fruit. Not bitter at all. Easily crushable. Very lucky to live 8 min away from brewery.  I always get it when they release it. Is a great trading beer"
3184,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.56,"Ok, so I recently picked up some of these down here in Milwaukee. Never had it before, was on my want list for several years now.  Poured a dark near black. Smells heavily barrel forward, and not cheap barrel at that. Tastes like the nose; barrel forward with the beer itself complimenting the notes of the barrel. Barrel lingers in the mouth for a bit then fades to the base beer. If you want a BA stout that isnt barrel dominant, this isn't for you. Interestingly, though, I usually fall in that camp and I absolutely love this beer and am hoarding all I can find of it."
3185,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.25,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla, with a lightly boozy bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, with strong notes of chocolate, coffee and vanilla and ligher notes of toffee, dark fruits, tobacco, charred oak, bourbon and a hint of a certain musty earthiness. Finishes with a light bitterness and booziness. Thick, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. This is reasonably complex and quite well-balanced, although the barrel-character is not that much at the forefront. Still, all the different notes intermingle harmoniously without anything standing out too much. Remionds me a little of KBS, actually."
3186,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.43,"2018 vintage. Pours dark black with minimal brown foam head. Huge barrel on the nose with notes of chocolate, coffee and slight vanilla. Taste is coffee, chocolate and barrel, all working together well. Medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel. Barrel stays with you for a little while. Overall excellent brew."
3187,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.17,"Honestly was a little bit letdown with this one. To be fair, I had it at a share that included four other Cantillons. It's still a very solid Gueuze, but the lesson learned is that Cantillon simply makes much better beers than this one."
3188,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.71,"This was a gifted bottle from a BIF buddy - and one that I was very, very excited about. I shared this with friends at a local brewery, thus my pour was small, but the beer is undeniably impressive - the nose is full of maple and coffee notes. The beer tastes of light coffee roast, just a bit acidic from the coffee, with plenty of pleasant maple syrup and cacao. It is baffling to me that this is so much harder to get than Fundamental Observation - but as good as it is, it perhaps should not surprise. Who wants to trade away such a fantastic beer?"
3189,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.62,"Had it at the brewery. Pours dark brown 2 fingers of brownish head, smells like really good coffee, tastes like it too with roast and alchohal. Overall a very fine brew I'll have again"
3190,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.5,"Batch 6. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Hill Farmstead stemmed wine glass.  Pours a slightly hazy orange body with a big frothy white head that leaves spotty lacing and a layer of retention.  Aromas are mesmerizing, citrus and tart green apple, funk and oak, brett, peppery saison yeast. As it warms the aromas get more potent and inviting. Can't wait to try it.  On the tongue is a balanced, delicate tartness, citrus and dry tart fermented fruit, delicious funk, peppery yeast, moderate oak presence on the follow through. Easy drinker, crisp and delicate, medium carbonation and light but flavorful body.  A true showcase of how micro-flora can work to make a beer world class. Amazing."
3191,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.53,"Jet black pour with a brown head that fades into a thick collar and light surface webbing. Huge cinnamon and coffee aromas lead the nose, light peppers, and bittersweet chocolate. Taste is much the same with vanilla and earth accents, more dark in complexion on the palate than the original. It really tastes like sump and abraxas got blended together, coffee gets stronger with warmth. Feel is patently spiced and hot pepper heat amongst lush malts and slight booze. The original is still the best but this was well worth the time to acquire"
3192,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.48,"L - 1-finger dense mocha head atop a pitch black body. S - oak, raisins, chocolate, vanilla. Not even a hint of booze. T - tons of dark fruit, smoke, chocolate, roast, vanilla, then some bourbon on the finish. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Low booziness. F - medium-full body. Carb has held up well (2014 bottle) O - superbly well balanced and dangerously drinkable for 11%."
3193,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.39,The brew pours a cloudy orange with a 2 cm foam cap. The foam is fine. 
3194,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.28,"From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery 05/08/19. Served in a tulip. Pours a hazy, glowing honey-gold with maybe a finger of loose, bubbly suds. For such a scant head, retention is pretty exceptional and leaves a heavy cap of scummy froth. Concentric rings of lacing right to the bottom of the glass. A fairly low-intensity nose of yeasty bread roll and sweet citrus. Taste is big and boozy with unexpectedly intense bitterness. Oily orange peel and bitter pith, the whole grapefruit, pith, peel and juice, spicy grass, and maybe a shot of triple sec to boot. Resinous, with tongue-coating hop oils. Mouthfeel is silky and vodka-like. No more than medium bodied and brightly carbonated.  Overall, well, this is by far the booziest tasting pale ale I’ve ever had from Hill Farmstead which, at 9.6% abv is, I suppose, only right and proper. Compared with a Triple IPA from a brewer like Trillium, which tends to be thick, heavy and muddled like a juice-based cocktail, Ephraim is relatively light and clean, more reminiscent of a flavored or infused vodka."
3195,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.77,"Lightly foggy burnt orange to amber, nearly glowing, with a tall off-white foam head settling to unevenly airy, bubbly lumps that are somewhat translucent, translating more to a khaki hue, leaving tiny spots of lace on the glass. Smell is both more oaky and peppery than regularly OG, a little dusty even, but also brighter and spicier, in a pleasant, sense-awakening way. Adding to the allure are hints of dried, gooey apricot, fresh fig and white grape. The medium body's lively effervescence perks up the palate, again with surprisingly bright, zippy characteristics. It's super refreshing and also very pleasantly balanced on the palate, quaffable to a frightening degree, particularly for a bottle so hard to find. It's like a mimosa with white grape juice instead of orange, while very fine white oak adds complementary complexity without any undesirable features, and barely a touch of funk. Again here it's more peppery, yet not as toasty as regular OG, but it simultaneously gives a feel like you can crunch down on it before the frothy light carbonation dies into a perfectly clean, semi-dry swallow. It consistently reminds me of nelson, my favorite hop. Absolutely scrumptious, with an unbelievable mouthfeel."
3196,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.47,"2018 vintage. Central waters just doesn’t disappoint with the stouts. Fantastic medium thick creamy body, great head retention. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla and whiskey on the nose. Whiskey soaked chocolate cake flavor. Tip tier stuff all around."
3197,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.16,"Nothing would compare to the first ever cbs I had but the newest year have a respectable felt and flavor, the maple and chocolate pair for a fair combination of 2 of the most seek flavors in a BA stout. Body it’s not as thick as I personally like but the flavor is there. Overall a good beer."
3198,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.25,One of the beers that started it all for me. Not quite as tropical as you’d think but still juicy. 
3199,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.39,"Glad to finally see this around the triad.Pours into an imperial nonic a clear medium golden with a thinner white head that left a few broken 'globs' of lace as it settled pretty quickly.You get the grapefruit sharpness in the nose along with some hefty resin,slightly boozy.Citric but with a zesty punch on the palate,not like Tang ,resinous on the back end and never overly sweet.Bring on the resin!Love the beer it's not overly sweet and boozy,and again it's not like drinking citrus punch."
3200,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.25,"After watching Michael Conforto lean Into a pitch with the bases loaded to win a game, I’m feeling a bit perplexed. But Treehouse says “don’t worry, Raul, the best medicine for “perplexion” is JJJuliosss! And Raul likey! Soft, ripe, juicy... I’m not tripping like the first time Mickey saw a Minnie, but it’s pretty good."
3201,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.47,"Toppling Goliath can do no wrong. Another great offering from them. Pours a light amber with nice lacing and great bright color. Tropical and dank mixture in the aroma. Great mixture of tropical fruit and bitter happiness on the taste. The flavor really changes as it rolls back on on the tongue from sweet to bitter. Great, light mouthfeel and great beer overall."
3202,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.5,"Finally ticking off a true classic. Dark brown hued body, nearly black. Toffee, caramel, vanilla, touch of dark fruit. Deep chocolate and toffee sweetness, layered in a damp oaky embrace. Full bodied, good carbonation, butterscotch all the way through."
3203,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.27,Had this in Aruba …. Reputedly best beer in the world at the time. It was damn good…. Best beer in the world good?… it was good…. Not worth the 30-50 bucks I paid for it though
3204,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.44,"Upper Case pours a thick, murky orange juice yellow with a small, 1-finger ivory white head that leaves little lacing on the glass. The smell has a big tropical fruit aroma with orange, mango and grapefruit with a big bite of danky hop resin. The taste is sweet candied fruit inducing pineapple, mango and good dose of citrus zest with a creamy goodness from the raw wheat. A complex bitterness creeps in finishing rather sticky. Overall, this is a very solid NE style DIPA. Another great beer out of Trillium brewing. Cheers!"
3205,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,3.98,This beers pours hazy orange with moderate white head. Not super thick hazy like some NE styles. But you can't see thru it. 
3206,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,3.67,"Review 1500 I have wanted to try this beer for over five years. This is my 1500 review, sure I have larger whales in the cellar. I wanted something that I have been chasing. I have two more in the cellar to see how they age. This beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered creamy dark tan head with good retention. I was sad to see a poor display for the head. I have poured 15% stout with an outstanding head before. The head did not leave any trace of its existence on the glass. The beer is dark as they come SRM 40, dark overused motor oil without the smell. The beer is average for a stout. I wanted more retention and lacing all over the glass; nevertheless, a beautiful stout.  The initial aromas in the beer are tobacco, chili, earthiness, and chocolate. Nosing further, I detect vanilla, molasses, stone fruit, dank basement, raisins, dusty barn, coffee, smoke, and dark roasted malts, Earthy tobacco with chilis and dusty barn are the dominant aromas. This is freaking weird, I have never smelled a beer like this, I am unsure what to think. Usually, I smell different aromas in a stout but this one is an odd one. I am not saying it is bad but different.  The flavors in the beer are huge chili, tobacco, molasses, smokiness without the Maillard, vanilla bullying its way in there, raisins, figs, medium-dark chocolate, cereal grains, espresso, floral esters, dusty barn, dark roasted malts, cinnamon, dank musty basement, and phenolic.  The mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and rich.  The body of the beer is full, low carbonation, and a full finish.  I think this beer is bad; however, the flavors are like nothing I have ever tasted in a beer. I have consumed Westbrook Mexican Cake, I thought I was going to get something similar to that. This beer is strange indeed. The dominant flavor is earthy tobacco, dusty barn with a sprinkling of cinnamon and vanilla."
3207,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,5.0,"This is hands down my favorite beer. Ever. Was lucky to have a fellow beer drinker at the grocery recommend it months ago. Tastes great, strong citrus notes. Almost too easy to drink. My wife, who likes no beers, is now stealing these when they are in the house. Case closed."
3208,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.5,Type: 6-oz. draft (I think)
3209,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.9,"The perfect cherry lambic. The best way to describe this beer is ""Delicate"". It has the perfect mouthfeel and the delicate and perfect balance of cherry flavors, tartness and acidity. Can't do any better for a cherry beer."
3210,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.45,"2017 vintage. A: Pours a brown-tinted black, and manages just a thin ring of dense tan head with an aggressive pour. Exceedingly persistent. A few long streaks of lacing. S: Sweet baker’s chocolate in the forefront, alongside vanilla, bourbon, and oak, with a hint of roast that’s almost char-like. T: Rich, sweetish chocolate is balanced slightly more with some roastiness (nearly burnt) and dark coffee, but the balance is still towards the chocolate. Pretty well integrated bourbon, oak, and vanilla which round out the flavor and last through the finish.  M: Full bodied, chewy, with a sharp medium carbonation. Warming with a slight alcohol bite.  O: Very respectable barrel aged RIS. Doesn’t quite have the complexity or depth of other examples, but tasty and well executed. I could do without the char-like flavor, though."
3211,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.49,"12oz can dated 7/29/20. Pours clear gold with s chill haze. A short head of white retreated quickly revealing a partial skim coat with minor lacing. Pungently tropical and juicy in the nose. Pineapple, mango, peach, tangerine, and apricot. Medium bodied with a sticky, tacky mouthfeel. Candied citrus on the palate with light malt and some throat warmth. A fruit cocktail of pineapple, pear, mango, and orange pith. Finishes a bit sweet and bitter with lingering tropicals and booze."
3212,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.75,"Parabola 2020. Enjoyed 7-28-20. Oak, plum, sweet tobacco and chocolate on the nose. Chocolate and plum and oak on palate with a caramelly finish that leaves a sticky film on the tongue. Smooths out even more as it warms up. I would imagine this beer would be a prime candidate for aging."
3213,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.5,"this stuff is divine, and in such an unassuming package too, crazy! thanks to my brother for sourcing this rarity, thought i might never get to taste this one. its a treat too, so much coffee, enough so even that is stands out as way more than the vanilla bean double shit, which we enjoyed right before this one. its almost gritty and bitter in comparison, but the vanilla sure did a lot to sweeten that up and round it out. here we have a truer expression of the coffee, more isolated in a way, and i love how robust it is, almost as much coffee as it is beer, although i do get a little booziness poking through this one in the aroma. the coffee has deep chocolate tones to it, a little spiciness even, a rigid sort of bitterness mid palate, and a real richness as well, notes of molasses and maple work in from the grain here, and there is a neat almost amaretto layer. maybe not quite as complex as the double shot was to me, a little more straight forward from the grain, but i love the way the coffee manifests itself in here, about as forward as i have known it to be in any beer, and lingering forever on the palate after each slow sip. this is the ultimate coffee beer really, and the freshness of the coffee really stands out as well, especially for something that was bottle many months before we opened it. it was wonderful to finally get to drink some of these hard to get tree house stouts, thanks to my brother! these were unforgettable!"
3214,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.29,"Bottle @ 10K + OT. Thanks, Jake. Black in color without much/any head. Crazy marshmallow and graham cracker nose. Lots of cinnamon, chocolate, and vanilla. Light spice, slight fruity brandy, and some caramel. Tastes like smores and cinnamon toast crunch. Crazy marshmallow, chocolate, and cinnamon. Dark chocolate, vanilla, and a subtle chile spiciness. Really solid."
3215,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,3.62,"Currently ranked #6 in the ""Wild Ale"" Top beers list and #70 in the Top Beers list with a perfect score of 100. 375ml brown glass bottle with hood-and-wire cap over a branded cork served chilled into a tulip (as indicated is ideal on the label and even on the cork). Bottled 04/03/20. ""100% spontaneously fermented beer aged in wine barrels."" ""Barrel aged 9 to 36 months"" (that's quite a spread...). ""...fermented beer using only wild yeast and bacteria."" 6.00% ABV. HEAD: None really...just a floater ring that's rather thin and weak, dissipating in under 10 seconds. BODY: Also a bit thin and weak, and certainly dull with a depleted and dareisay undercarbonated look. I imagine I'm going to enjoy this beer, but we're kidding ourselves if this is a perfect 5 for appearance. AROMA: Oak, barrel-derived vanillin, white wine, still cidre, obvious lactic acid. The bacterial aromatics are much more subdued than I imagined they'd be coming in...they register, but it's not teeming with lactobacillus like so many American brewed sour ales (I'm looking at you, Cascade Brewing). Doesn't seem as full of life and bacteria-ridden as, say, Allagash's coolship ales, but it's enticing with promises of ample barrel character, microfloral intricacy, and diverse bacteria. I don't get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes finds in well-meaning sour ales and I find no signs of infection. Some green apple, sure, suggesting perhaps acetobacter. No vomit-redolent aromatics that would indicate butyric acid are present. Aromatic intensity is average for the style, maybe even a bit on the timid side. Doesn't scream acidity, but it does seem acidic judging by the aroma. TASTE & TEXTURE: Zaps with mellow acidity and puckering yet mellow bacteria, hitting on all fronts (pediococcus, brettanomyces yeast, and lactobacillus. Not a lactobomb, yielding to the lactobacillus without letting it dominate the beer's flavour profile. I can't shake the feeling this would be better fruited. Some source of added sweetness would help counter its dry acidity; this lacks the tartness that often accompanies sourness and I think it's worse for it. Smooth, smacky, deliberately undercarbonated (and to good effect, I might add, evoking a fine Brittany still cidre), a bit wet up front and a bit dry mid-body. Oak and concomitant woodsy flavours tie the brew together without feeling in-your-face, but I could do with more barrel flavour myself...I'd guess this particular 2020 batch was aged closer to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claimed range, and that much to its detriment. I don't get barrel vanillin per se or rich toasted oak, and the wine character is decidedly lacking in terms of depth of flavour. I mean there's faint white wine - perhaps muted Chardonnay or Riesling - but it's not as overt or nuanced as I'd like. Green apple/apple skins, orchard fruit, lime, rustic barnyard funkiness from well attentuated brettanomyces, scatterings of microflora (none of them as interesting as what one would find in a Senne valley sour), vinegar/acetic acid, grass, hay, maybe some faint clove/spice from aged hops. I suppose the bacteria dominate. Maltwise, I don't get much beyond 2-row and maybe a kiss of Cantillon-like cereal grains. Far from a sweet ale, and I do think it'd be better off fruited as noted above. OVERALL: It's not a holy shit son of a bitch ""man, you've got to try this!"" sour ale, and it's not even Russian River's best wine barrel aged sour ale (I'd tend to favour Supplication in that respect), but as an American imitation of Cantillon's spontaneously fermented sour ales, there's no doubt it's rather good, if not quite up there with the Allagash efforts in the category. I don't know that I'd shell out for it again at this price, but I'm glad to have gotten to try it. A long-time want and a damn solid ale, but I don't know that it beats the pants off your typical Belgian gueuze - many of which are easier to find than this and even as imports cost the same if not a biteen less. I'm an unabashed Russian River fanboy, but while it's certainly rather good, the creme da la creme this is not, and how anyone can give this an honest to God perfect 100 rating given its obvious appearance issues (and what I imagine is to many troublesome undercarbonation) is beyond me. B / GOOD"
3216,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.43,"A touch on the sweet side but this was a smooth and soft beer, delicious. Not much head despite an aggressive pour but beautiful deep orange body. Sweet citrus nose, light carbonation."
3217,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.63,I've had a few different years of this and they're all fantastic. It's worth the drive to Indiana to have a chance at landing it. I've had the last few years of this and they're all superb.
3218,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.37,"A- Pours dark brown with red tones around the edges and deep brown to black in the middle of the body. A small and bubbly head forms but doesn't stick around very long. Head is tan to light brown in color. Minimal lacing due to lack of head as you drink. S- Tart cherries are big up front, providing a juicy, fruity, and sour start to the scent. Just a touch of darker scents kick in with a hint of whiskey barrel right after the sour cherry. Spicy barrel and vanilla sweetness are the main scents of the barrel. Wonderfully complex smell all around. T- Starts off with a big sour cherry bang. Huge and juicy sour cherries preside over the front half of the taste before moving a little towards the darker flavors. Just a hint of dark malts are detectable under the sour cherry flavor, before the barrel character kicks in a little bit. Whiskey barrel spice and vanilla sweetness come in and compete with the strong cherry flavor, providing a little bit of balance. Ends with a lingering cherry tartness. M- Light and highly carbonated on the tongue, this feels like a traditional lambic or wild. The darker malts that give the beer its dark color and some darker flavors really don't translate to a creamier mouthfeel. Still, this is spot on for the wild ale style. Overall, this is a great beer, but not as phenomenal as I was anticipating. I was really hoping for more of a dark malt presence to compete with the cherries, but this is still a great beer."
3219,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.45,"A - Very dark amber; reddish 3/4 inch head that dissipates quickly; active bubbling. S - Wine; cherries; prunes. T - Sour cherries and grapefruit, but sourness not overly powerful; mild bitterness. M - Medium body; crisp from carbonation and medium booziness. O - Tons of flavor; fantastic smell; very palatable sour for non-sour drinkers."
3220,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.03,"Dark brown with a slight transparency, and almost no beige foam. Smells of coke, cocoa, and toasted malts. A little coffee in there too. Tastes of fruitiness, cocoa and chocolate. A hint of black liquorice as well. Thick and oily body, with little carbonation.  Quite a contrast with the barrel aged versions. Stoked to find it on tap at AleSmith brewery bar, June 1st, 2019. Am"
3221,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.47,Pours dark brown with a good finger of brownish head.
3222,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.74,"Points off on looks only because the head is fairly scrawny; much less than a finger in my pint glas;. nice lacing though. I have a lousy nose but as soon as I opened the can I could smell fruity goodness with citrus dominating. The taste is so well balanced, with a good amount of juicy +hoppy. Citrus flavors dominate but certainly only part of a really well balanced flavor profile. I really like this one a lot. More, please."
3223,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,3.58,"Backlog from Quintessence 2018 Pours a clouded lighter yellow with almost no head at all. Smells of faint grass, orange zest, moldy wood and a slighty acidic sourness. Has a very refreshing, lighter mouthfeel, balanced by a vivid, sparkling carbonation. Tastes of sour lemons, mellowing oak and a lighter funkiness from first glance, unreveling a very prominent sourness. Among old leather and more oak the funkiness gets pushed back a little by stale, sweeter malts, adding to the complexity of the tartness in this. Finishes calmer, with almost nothing prevailing but a long going sourness, producing a stonger acetic nuance. Quite nice for what it is, with its complexity not being in the same ballpark as any of the available Belgian beer‘s at the event of comparable style."
3224,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.57,"Pours a murky yellow color with a medium sized head, receeding to a small ring of lacing. Smells of a profound, herb accompanied lime quality, freshly dried kush and blueberries. This is quite remarkable on the nose, bringing up a kiwi fruitiness, as well as dried green apple and pomelo, all helping to enhance the profound lime impression. Has a fuller body, exhibiting a creamy mouthfeel with a lower, well fitting carbonation. Tastes of a sudden lemon bitterness, inheriting a noble, old world vibe among wet grass and blueberries. Turns a little more refreshing then, although the mouthfeel seems to become even creamier with some kiwis and ice-bonbon cutting through. Finishes with even more intense flavors of herbs, lime and ice-bonbon with a lighter, lasting bitterness. This tastes and smells equally intense of mosaic, highlighted by the beer‘s great mouthfeel. Very convincing on all levels, with just the right amount of bitterness in the end."
3225,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.58,"De Labirratorium. En copa Teku. Jugando a Fortnite. Con queso morado de Codi.

3226,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.49,2011 Bottling; # 3266. Picked up from Matt at Capone's at release. Cellared since then. Been saving this from a mixed case full of Eclipse back in the day.
3227,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.04,"Tasted from bottle. Pours dark brown/black with minimal head. Aroma is dark chocolate and vanilla. Moderate bitterness with alcohol burn on the finish. Flavors of cacao and vanilla, bourbon, toffee, caramel and maple. Huge beer and very dangerous."
3228,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,I can’t say enough about this. The bourbon barrel and the vanilla beans are balanced to perfection. The sweetness is cut by the smooth velvet flavor. World class beer and one of the best vanilla stouts out there. It’s one of those beers you must seek out once. Or many times.
3229,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.5,"Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam that retains really well. Aroma is heavy maple syrup and coffee with robust notes of roasty, toasty, bready malts and spry vanilla beans just beyond. It smells like a fresh slice of toast, dressed and drenched by maple syrup, while a roasty, steaming cup of coffee sits just aside. Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency. Overall, a thick and sugary beer, that while it lands more in the dessert beer category, does present itself exceptionally well as balanced and filling.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 22oz bottle."
3230,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,3.99,"16 oz can from Tavour. Cloudy amber pour, small silky head. Caramel malts first in the aroma , followed closely by bitter citrus notes. Faint honey. Sweet taste, honey, caramel coupled with a sharp bite. Velvety smooth."
3231,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.02,"Black, thick foamy head that settles into a fluffy cap. Aroma is fairly dark - lots of dark roast coffee, mild espresso, dark chocolate upfront. There is some bourbon caramel there but wanted a little more of that. A little fusel booze lingering.  I felt the palate to be pretty similar - heavy on those robust, dark notes with just not enough to smooth it out. Deep coffee, charred oak, a little ash / tobacco leaf, dark cacao etc. The bourbon notes are overwhelmed - you can find a little caramel / vanilla but it is drowned in those stout flavors. Some boozey heat on the backend which isn’t transitioned to nicely with a lingering sting of whiskey. Needs better harmony & balance."
3232,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.96,"Between wine and beer, this one is the least funky brew I've had from Cantillon. Pungeant notes of merlot are present. The lambic is present to balance the whole but never dominates the beverage. "
3233,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.85,2019 vintage
3234,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.65,"Stoked to finally get to try this one. My best friend Jon Passow has some friends in California who sent him a bottle of this that he is kind enough to share with me. Poured into a tulip glass, this beer pours a mainly clear, just slightly cloudy/hazy, light to medium golden color with a nice white head that's about an inch thick when first poured. Settles to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass at the beer's surface and there's also a thick cluster swirl of foam in the middle of the beer's surface and good, but not phenomenal, lacing. Aromas of some crisp, slightly zesty malts along with melon, citrus, floral, earthy, dank hops. Quite the bouquet of different hop aromas here. The flavor is pretty much on point to the aroma, with some somewhat bready, slightly zesty malts that are followed by all the aforementioned hop flavors cascading over my palate. Fruity hop notes of melon, grapefruit and oranges, a hint apricot, piney, and earthy hop notes with a hint of spice, and some floral hops as well that give nice hop bitterness. This is nicely, aggressively hopped and fairly bitter, but not overbearingly so. The hops really do dominate though, and come out more as the beer sits and warms up a bit. Such an excellent, very complex hop flavor profile. Has a fairly crisp, also smooth, slightly oily and resinous,medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish and all the aforementioned hop flavors linger on my palate for a long time after each sip. A fantastic beer all around!"
3235,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.5,"Pours black. Tastes sweet with maple, chocholate and coconut. Well balanced beer and not too bitter like some other well knows stouts. Dark tan head, and a pleasure to drink. I think its a bit thinner than my own taste, but a solid beer."
3236,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.66,"12oz bottle from 2019 into a snifter.  L: Almost still, with just a collar of fine tan bubbles adorning the top of a clear, deep russet body. There isn’t much foam, and it doesn’t leave any lace, but the collar persists and keeps it from looking lifeless. I think that’s what was intended.  S: Chocolate, fruit, smoke, in that order. The chocolate is semi-sweet, like chips perfectly melted into warm cookies. The fruit is quite bright, and wavers between apple/pear and citrus. Cherrywood smoke rounds things out. It smells simultaneously old and lively, complex and focused. Really special.  T: Everything from the nose comes through, plus added notes of tobacco, parchment, and spice. Layer upon layer, all rich with a consummately old-school aesthetic that I haven’t encountered in a beer this fresh in years. The finish is tingly with alcohol, but hardly overbearing. So, so good.  F: Soft, medium-full body with extremely delicate carbonation. Not quite as rich as the flavors could support, but solid for sure.  O: Wow. This is the best beer I’ve had in a long time, and is probably the best Strong Ale I’ve ever had. It typifies that style for me, as it does everything most Barleywines do and then some. So complex, so layered, so well-structured. Magnificent beer.  Cheers!"
3237,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.55,"Canned 10/1/20, tasted 10/28/20. A super-hyped beer that was certainly delicious, but didn't quite reach the pinnacle I was expecting. The look was not super-appetizing because it had a muddled orange/brown color - I found the brighter look of King Julius or Jjjuliusss to be much more appealing. The smell was excellent, though - very rich and enticing. The taste was very good but not incredible - it had a slight sourness to it that I wasn't a huge fan of. It definitely has a touch more bitterness and grassy hop character than KJ or Jjjsss, which may appeal to some palates, but in my view it detracted from what made those other beers stand out. The feel was good but not as fluffy or creamy as some other TH DIPAs."
3238,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.42,"12oz can dated 8/25/20. Pours clear gold with a chill haze. Nice retention with plenty of thick ropes of lacing. Clementines, peach, and dank resin in the nose. Aromatics are plump but not pungent and a bit subdued for the style. Medium bodied with a creamy but crispish mouthfeel. Orange zest with peach flesh on the palate. Finishes dry with barely a trace of balancing malt and a medium bitterness."
3239,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,3.9,"Bottled 11/24/14; drank 2/26/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Opaque brown appearance.  Almost no tan head; almost no lace.  Dark chocolate, black coffee & cognac notes in the nose.  Thick mouthfeel.  Sweet chocolate, coffee & cognac flavors up front; strong booze heat notes emerged as this warmed.  Bold flavors here, but this was very sweet & very hot. 2 more years might be needed to mellow this monster..."
3240,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.58,"Canned on 8/18/20; consumed 9/8/20 Pours an opaque dark orange with soft bronze hues and topped with multiple fingers of dense, creamy white head; excellent head retention fades slowly to a slim, craggy cap, expansive, frothy collar, and a multitude of chunky, soapy rings of lacing rounding the glass. Aroma bursts with a steady array of juicy tangerine and passionfruit backed with grassy tones and flaky malts as layers of orange complexity develop throughout the bouquet; subtle lemon flows effortlessly beneath a perfectly nuanced tropical profile as ripe guava, mango pith, peach chutney, and fresh grapefruit all develop in harmony over time. Taste opens with silky peach and more pronounced guava, with wisps of creamy orange lurking beneath; passionfruit and grapefruit peel develop a citric twang to the profile over the mid-palate while herbal lemon zest and a fluffy malt base fades with the finish/swallow. Mouthfeel offers a medium body synchronized with a delicate and fluffy moderate carbonation, plush along the palate with an impressive consistency and steadily building grit; juicy textures present subtly past the mid-palate, peaking with a fading hop acidity into a dry finish with a mild, zesty bitterness lingering. A stunningly nuanced approach to the NEIPA, almost deceptively balanced between an exceptionally refined flavor and unfaltering overall structure; a product of significant focus, depth, and ultimately, a level of simplicity which ties it all together as the world-class beer it is; there may be others with more a bombastic profile, but this remains unwavering and unassuming in its brilliance."
3241,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.9,L: pours thick and pitch black with no head
3242,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.64,"It's a Vanilla bomb, tasty! It's almost too much vanilla for me, but it's a treat. Good for bottle shares, there's no way I could tackle one by myself."
3243,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.44,"2019 vintage? 11.5% ABV. Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Portsmouth tulip. Seal brown liquid with a faint ecru collar. Vague lacing; no retention; thick sheen of tears cascades down the sides. Cocoa, treacle, stewed plums and currant jam, along with faint tobacco and milk chocolate notes in the nose. Lavish and inviting. Some alcohol around the edges, but nothing fusel.  Intense chocolate notes permeate the flavor profile, although the malt base has some definite complexity with a range of toast/char/chocolate notes. Bitterness is balanced between clean earthy hops and cocoa. Some warmth and spice from the ancho, while the spices emerge in the finish with a light dusting of cinnamon and the vanilla almost suggesting some time in a barrel. Rich, deep, but the adjuncts threaten to overwhelm the base beer. Medium, earthy finish. Creamy, smooth, full-bodied, sticky mouth-feel. Light but sufficient carbonation.  Outstanding, well balanced, bittersweet, and potent."
3244,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.41,"a: dark, jet silky black color that does not allow any light to penetrate. head is nothing more than a very thin tan film that forms around the edge of the glass s: roasted malts, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cola, sticky syrup, maple syrup, sweet lactose. a touch of char, but mostly super-rich chocolate and roasted malts on the nose t: roasted malts and a huge punch of maple syrup upfront. milk and dark chocolate behind that with some cocoa powder and hot chocolate. sweet marshmellows and dark sticky toffee. dark caramel and a touch of oak. a massive lactose sweetness as a backbone in here as well with some cola and more chocolate to close m: sticky, heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation o: intensely sweet milk stout here. not overbearing, but the sweetness is in your face. it's super-rich, and full of chocolate and roast. the maple in the flavor is a nice addition. very solid, for the style"
3245,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.27,"I've only had this once. Liked it more than regular BT, but still had the typical Bruery sweetness and heat. Definitely more complex and interesting that regular though, and overall a tasty beer that's perfect for a big share."
3246,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.4,"Pours a hazy golden color with a medium head that persists as lacing. Smells of piney floral hops with some citrus. Tastes of malt, hops, citrus and pineapple with a lightly bitter finish. Medium body with light carbonation. Smooth clean mouthfeel. This is a very plesant, mild mannered, drinkable and well made brew."
3247,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.51,Fresh can courtesy of yllib. Hazy to opaque appearance. Nice fluffy head. 
3248,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.35,"L: jet black, not much head, some lacing "
3249,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.5,"Late check in, reviewed from notes. Poured into a tulip, dark orange body. Heavy citrus zest, a bit boozy, lots of fruits, creamy. Easy drinker for a triple IPA."
3250,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.75,"Bottle at the brewery, 2012 vintage. Hazy bright orange with a thin white head and visible carbonation. Notes of peaches, apricots, barnyard funk, lactic acid, mineral components, salt, macerated apples, grape vinegar, light apple cider. Medium body with high carbonation and a sour and refreshing aftertaste. Delicious."
3251,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.25,Poured out as a slightly hazed orange color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer is packed with funky nectarine sourness which is to be expected from de Garde. The flavors are similar to the nosem lots of acidic funky nectarine coming in full speed from start to finish. The feel is light to medium bodied and dry. Overall it's a kick ass sour. So it's worthy seeking out if you're into that sort of thing.
3252,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.59,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a SP stemmed wine glass.  Pours a hazy orange body with a fluffy white head that reduces to leave leggy lacing and minimal retention. Aromas are potent and pungent - ripe stone fruits, apricot, a little grassy and floral, white wine, tart but not sour smelling.  On the tongue, it's pretty tart with lots of stone fruit, apricot, citrus, lactic acid, oak, funky on the finish and rounded out with wine and oak. Dry, crisp, easy to drink.  This was a real winner - the aroma stole the show but the taste was world class."
3253,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.39,"03/2015 - so much maple syrup on the nose, plus coffee and bready aromas; incredible iced coffee-like flavors, lovely maple syrup yet not sickly sweet, some lactose, and a bit of salt on the palate; roasty bitterness finishes it off."
3254,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.7,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Aroma has spicy notes like cinnamon and chili with whiskey and dark chocolate on top. Taste is spicy but well balanced with dark chocolate bitterness and light chili heat."
3255,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.37,"Howdy everybody! Good to be back! Man oh man I haven't done an actual review in a century. Hell I've barely done more than the occasional review over the past few years. Don't blame me! Blame the fact craft is dying where I'm at.  Saw this posted by a local liquor store and KNEW I had to have the legend I remember hearing so much about over the years. Here we go! Look - Yellowish orange with a finger of white head. Fairly hazy though twinges of clarity. Low lace upon a finished glass. Smell - Floral and seems to be loaded to the brim with Mosaic I remember so fondly before the juice bomb phase of beer decided to rear its head. Taste - Straight floral with some grapefruit goodness. Feel - Right here is where I feel this beer really shines through. This is probably the smoothest pale/ipa I have ever had in my near decade of drinking the crafts, Goes down silky smooth. Almost like water but the body isn't watery. Does that make sense? Probably not but you get it...maybe. No I'm serious. I've almost finished the glass and didn't even notice. LOW bitterness even if it sits. Seriously. How did FFF manage to achieve this smoothness? It doesn't even seem real. Overall - While I do not feel the flavors live up to the legendary status, This is ABSOLUTELY the smoothest pale/ipa you are ever going to find anywhere. This will impress new craft drinkers and the seasoned veteran all the same. $13.99 in my opinion is a bit stiff for a sixer, But If you want something flavorful that you can throw back in a pinch without any of the cloying sweetness and or bitterness that some of these brews can eventually take on, This is your guy."
3256,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.34,"Appearance was darker than expected but everything else was just as advertised. It has plenty of raspberry flavor, but its more than a juice bomb. Subtle funk, dryness, and raspberry seeds make it a very enjoyable treat."
3257,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.32,"Very, very attractive beer. Burned orange in color, but what really stands out is the gorgeous head. Dense, foamy & long lasting with extensive lacing. Aroma has lots of citrus & tropical notes, with orange being what jumps out at me the most.  Taste has more of the tropical / citrus notes with the hops working well together. The orange detected on the nose is not present on the tongue, although some hints of grapefruit do come through. Amazingly full mouthfeel. Good beer."
3258,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.39,"Sweet orange/tangerine citrus, tropical hoppy, and mosaic dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a juicy and balanced, hoppy and citrus bitter swallow. This is nice and soft/juicy on the palate! This is good stuff!"
3259,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.43,"Appearance - The beer poured a murky black color with a mocha colored head crowning the glass.  Smell - Cinnamon really set off the nose. Darker coffee notes lay the background.  Taste - The taste was very smooth. Cinnamon was mild at first, but got warmer in the back. Coffee notes were smooth, but stayed toward the back. There was a bourbon burn at the finish to match the cinnamon.  Mouthfeel - The feel was smooth enough to make me forget this was not a milk stout.  Overall - Cinnamon is such a difficult thing to nail in beer. This beer does a nice job."
3260,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.69,"Pours a raspberry-ish color with a white head that flees the premises like it’s trying to steal the body. The nose a little funky and a lotta ripe raspberries and some oak. I am a HUUUUUUGE fan of raspberries, so I am literally frothing at the mouth waiting to take a sip of this. The wait is worth it - this is a raspberry sledgehammer with a nice mix of tart funky flavors and the oak for balance. This is absolutely delicious - I don’t toss around 5’s lightly, but this is probably the best flavor I’ve had in a fruited beer.  The mouthfeel is bright and drying on the finish. What a treat this beer is."
3261,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.96,"Pours opaque, dark brown in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is liquid French toast: cinnamon, vanilla, coffee, and cocoa. Medium-heavy bodied, sweet, with medium-low carbonation. Every time I do not think Tree House can out do itself with a stout, they make another great one. Do not know how Nervous Energy can be any more French Toast than this. Exceptional stout."
3262,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.59,"375 ml bottle, dated 11/15/18, poured into a flute A- A slightly hazy bright ruby red with a small pink head. S- Sour, raspberry jam, funky, oak, some tannins. T- Sour, wild raspberries, lemons, some tannins, a little earthy, funky, oak, very well balanced. M- Smooth, light body, crisp. O- A very tasty lambic, well balanced, easy to drink."
3263,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.46,"Currently ranked #24 in the Top New England IPAs and #1 in the Top Louisiana Beers List. Currently #109 overall.  On-draught @ Avenue Pub, New Orleans, LA. $7 for a 6oz pour. APPEARANCE: No head. Pulpy yellow-orange body. Not so much hazy as turbid and murky. Doesn't look great. Alcoholic Odwalla juice captures it.  AROMA: Pulp. Orange zest. Papaya. Guava. Wheat. Pale malt. Does have some nice Citra-derived pulpy hop aromatics, but it suggests an IPA with no bitterness and limited hop pungency. TASTE: Matches the aroma. Suffers from shallow depth of flavour and poor hop pungency so it fails to showcase Citra hops as a result. Citrus pulp, pale malts, floral hop notes. So brief, so simplistic, so shallow. I mean it's drinkable and enjoyable, but it doesn't showcase its chosen hop varietal well on a fundamental level. TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, pulpy, uneven, refreshing, medium-bodied. I wouldn't call it juicy but it is thick and a bit chewy.  OVERALL: Hides its ABV impressively well. Highly drinkable. But not a top tier IPA nor a great Citra hopped beer. I'd probably pick it up occasionally if it was available at $10 a sixer. Far from great.  High B- (3.46) / WORTHY"
3264,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.73,"This should be top 10 ipa. Had in draft at the Greenway beer garden and in a 4 pack from the Congress st Brewery. Got a mixed case and no surprise , they are all incredible."
3265,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.42,"2017 bottle drank out of a tulip on 04.04.20 Poured thick and dark with a nice cream colored half inch head, some of which lingered around the edges of the glass for the remainder of the pour. I couldn't get much aroma but it's just not a strong suit of mine - I'm sure it was there. Taste was dominated by strong dark coffee. As it warmed, the barrel notes really came out and I really enjoyed it; the sweetness was nuanced and perhaps hidden in the bitterness such that it wasn't so much in your face as you typically get in so many of today's pastry stouts so this was a nice change. I didn't get much of the typical oatmeal stout flavors, but that also might have been masked in the roadty coffee notes and the barrel taste. As I write my review, I realize this is quite a complex beer but for me, it was rather two note - dark coffee and bourbon barrel. If that's what you want - this will hit the spot - and it hit the spot for me last night. If you can get the rest of the beauty, good on you, there's a lot here! (And I've got a 2016 bottle aging as well!) Cheers!"
3266,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.65,"B6. Lovely hazy sunshine in the glass. The nose is bright, fresh and astringent -- lemon and minerals mostly. This a perfectly balanced beer that has citrus, pith, stone, vinous and oaky notes. Extremely smooth and endlessly drinkable. Another HF winner."
3267,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.33,"Moderate bar poured head which settles to rim bubbles and a fine film of continual effervescence in the center. Some wide streaks of lace.  Weedy and mildly peppery hop nose.  Full bodied with a high level of carbonation. This is a big beer -- full flavored and rich. No alcohol presence because of the solid lightly toasted malt and the strong white pepper hop. Long, well balanced aftertaste. Simply a world class beer."
3268,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.96,Some of Side Projects finest! Had this alongside a 2011 Cantillon LPF and this was better. Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!
3269,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.63,"Pours a rich bluish, purple with healthy blueberry yogurt head. Bottom of cork and nose smells like spontaneous funk with minimal barnyard mustiness but with healthy blueberry aroma. Taste is young lambic citric acidic sourness with big tannic presence, a bit of lacto, and slight but real blueberry undertones. Mouthfeel is full but the finish is very bitter and dry. Overall, this is one of the best blueberry beers I've had but it's a difficult fruit to conquer. Age would tone down the bitterness and let the lambic base come around but would likely diminish the amazing nose and kill the fruit from the taste. Great beer but I prefer many of Cantillon's other offerings."
3270,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.41,"Dinner is surprisingly hazy for an Imperial IPA. It is golden mango (SRM5-7). A quick, glistening cascade finishes shortly after pouring and builds a fluffy, one and a half inch tall head. The head slowly fades, leaving dense, froth lace on a PBGC IIPA Pub glass. The aroma has pronounced tangerine, followed by orange pith and a hint of pine. The background is composed of grapefruit and mango. The flavor is quite bitter, which holds from the initial entry through an endless finish. The background aromas come alive with the flavor of mango and orange leading the way. Even the slightest warmth draws out orange pith and amplifies the bitterness. A little more warmth brings out pine tar. The body is medium to full with a woolly texture. Carbonation is modest and well-controlled with alcohol about as expected. Clearly this is an IIPA, albeit a bit hazy, in my opinion. Dinner was a surprise offering from a small local pub that has some very special rare items more often than should be expected. I enjoyed it during the surreal virus outbreak on a bitterly cold, brilliantly sunny, Saturday afternoon at home."
3271,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.27,"Pours a golden straw color with almost a finger of head. The nose has some tropical fruit notes but it is much more muted than I expected based on this beer's reputation. The flavor profile has a solid malt backbone with definite notes of tropical fruits mixed in. The finish is a fine bland of hop bitterness and residual sweetness. This is a very good offering but, based upon the name, I expected an assertive resiny and sharp piney quality. That didn't happen."
3272,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,3.97,"A- Pours with barely a head, even with a churning, vigorous pour. What little head forms doesn't retain very long and the pour appears more as a liquor in the glass once the foam is gone. There is no lacing in the deep drown pour. The pour itself is very hazy and has little to no red when held to the light. S- There is a good combo of sweet scent components and barrel flavors right of the bat on the nose. Light peat scents and sweeter, light brown sugar notes are prominent. The barrel provides more of a scotch flavor to the scent than a bourbon flavors, with the wood and peat being the strongest. T- Start off with a slight hint og dark fruits on the tongue, that is quickly followed with notes of whiskey and peat malts. The dark fruits and peat meld into a mildly dark malt flavor overall and lend themselves to the whiskey flavors of the barrel fairly well. Like in the scent, the barrel component is more scotch than boubon in my opinion, and as such, lends to a more mild flavor that accentuates the peat malts. Lingering flavor is an intermingling of the barrel, the malts, and the dark fruits. M- what this beer has in spades is a smooth and thick mouthfeel. The beer itself drinks incredibly easily for a 10% ABV imperial style and has a moderate level of carbonation. Overall, this beer is about average for the barrel aged barkeyline style. It has a ton of scotch-like qualities, which isn't necessarily my thing, The dark fruit flavors are good, and the barrel is noticeable, but the smoothness of this beer is what is remarkable."
3273,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.65,"A: black pour, almost stout-like. Includes a very dark head to boot. Head dissipates quickly like most barrel aged brews. S: cinnamon and lots of it. Bit of sugary caramel from the barrel. T: wow! Again, loads of cinnamon both in flavor and in heat. I don't taste the coconut so much as feel it, it adds a lot of richness to the brew and leaves an oily, coconutty film after every sip. Bourbon barrel adds a lot of sweetness which balances everything out. M: thick, heavy and oily O: this is one hell of a winter warmer. The typical flavors are complimented and enhanced with the additions. This is an incredibly rich and sweet dessert beer, make no mistake. Startlingly good beer, one of the best I've had in a long while"
3274,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.18,"Bodhi brewed by Columbus Brewing Company, with an ABV of 8.50% This American Imperial IPA pours out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint beer glass a nice golden amber color. There is also a nice white head on top of this brew with a nice amount of lacing. The lacing sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, a slight citrus flavor, with earthy grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Bodhi. So far this is a nice inviting brew, now for the taste. It is rich and bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness with citrus flavors. The body of Bodhi is a medium to heavy but not to heavy. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.50% ABV in this brew. It goes down this smooth, the citrus flavors are a nice touch to this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. If you are a fan of IPA'S you should look this brew up. The mouth feel is Hoppy, Bold ,Rich, Clean , Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give Bodhi a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Columbus Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this IPA."
3275,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.22,"A- Tallboy pours a black brew into a tulip glass. The cocoa dark brown head shoots up quickly to an inch high with a decadent foamy consistency and pretty good retention. Small sheets of lacing from a tiny ring at the edges. S- Hershey's chocolate, mocha, lactose sweetness and roast grains are massive in the aroma and this one finds a nice balance between the dessert and the base stout beer. In the end things come down to the great combo of espresso coffee and milk chocolate, a classic combo that isn't always easy to pull off beer. This comes off as fresh mocha with no coffee ground hints. Caramel and vanilla round it all out. T- Not quite as sharp as the aroma as the sweetness comes down a bit harder on the palate really pushing that Herhey's milk chocolate feel even further but still well executed. Caramel, molasses, lactose and fudge sweets open things up for rich espresso notes, slight dark fruits, charred bitter roast barley, toasted nuts, vanilla and marshmallow. Again, lands with a very gripping sweetness and it overshadows a lot of the other flavors compared to the harmony of the aroma. MF- Luscious and wonderfully soft on the palate. The beer is very, very thick but the texture is chewy and downright creamy and oh so smooth. Carbonation is at a medium level and roasty bitterness lingers in the finish. A very nice aroma of mocha and vanilla leads into a taste that approaches too sweet but thankfully never goes over that threshold. Enjoyed more than some of the other holiday time stouts from Tree House as the chocolate is held in check here and overall it finds a pretty nice balance."
3276,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.33,"Poured from bottle into tulip, good 2 finger dark tan head, good retention and lacing. Jet black on the glass, no light gets thru. Smells of roasted malt, roasted coffee and coconut on the nose. Taste follows nose, coconut is the king though from the first sip to the finish it is all about the coconut. Not too sweet, and no roast bitterness to speak of. Easy drinking beer"
3277,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.67,"A: Pours black, but had hazy oily finish on top... Ended up with stout snot in 3rd pour from glass. S: Chocolate and Bourbon in the nose--no coconut detected. Beautiful smelling beer, one of top BA Stouts smells in my opinion. T: Really, really good but not great. Chocolate comes through first and bourbon hits next with the coconut sweetening the bourbon slightly. Almost tasted like a coconut sweetened BCS.  M: I am not sure where everyone else is calling this thick... seemed like in the mouth to me. Still solid beer but nothing on order of other big stouts.  O: Smell rivals BAA (that is a HUGE compliment), but the taste is only mildly better than BCS and oily appearance with snot took this down a notch for me. Not bad, but will try other BL stouts to see if I believe the hype a bit more."
3278,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,5.0,"Let my 2017 sit out for 9 months in my closet. It was insane, fudgey, chocolatey, nice mouth feel and great coffee that did become muted over time (I prefer that). One of my favorites."
3279,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.54,"2020 release. Received from @roguer. Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. It pours almost jet black with a creamy, medium mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly. Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon. All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors. It's so easy to drink. The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% . Overall, Hunahpu's is everything I thought it would be - and more. It's delicious and perfect either to pair with a hearty meal or for casual drinking. I'm grateful to finally drink this white whale."
3280,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.43,Very nice beer. Carb complemented the beer well and it was very refreshing. The star of the show was clearly the peaches. They came through very well and worked excellent with the base beer
3281,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.63,Pours golden with nice carbonation. Rim of white head. Nice wine barrel aroma. Great lemon character with some vinous grapey undertones. Touch of wheat on the finish. This is such a delicate beautiful beer. I wish that Shaun brewed straight up regular Flora more often.
3282,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.27,"Not the darkest pour in the world, but sits opaque black in the glass, with a super dense, mocha head. Smells like a freshly emptied bourbon barrel, which means a lot of the actual “beer” smell is overpowered. However, the flavors are much more balanced, and it’s scarily drinkable for over 10%. Like drinking a mountain of baker’s chocolate brownie batter. Bittersweet, vanilla, roasted coffee. Smooth as silk. Great stuff."
3283,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.93,"The best beer I have tasted. Amazing balance, hides alcohol so well! So much, 10 times better than Pliny the Elder (which in my view is over hyped)."
3284,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.99,"Very Hazy is one of my favorite beers, so when I saw this beer come up this week I had to make the 2 hour drive to grab the limited 4 pack. Poured the can into a nice broad tulip glass, the color is a dark yellow/light orange hue. Half inch froth which quickly disappeared. The smell is of ripe fruit, no sour tones. The taste and feel is what sets this beer apart. First sip tastes like grapefruit with mango/guava and then a clean slight bitter aftertaste. The feel of this beer is world class, somewhere between cotton candy and warm bread. The taste is soft and fluffy. If you get a chance to grab a can of this beer you will not be disappointed!"
3285,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.43,"Pours an almost brown color, with a slight head. Smells a bit funky and citric. There is an intense early tart flavor to this, but it mellows out very nicely. Not overly tart at all. Lots of wood barrel in there also. Some slight carbonation rounds this beer out beautifully. So glad to have tried it. 2011 750ml bottle"
3286,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.17,"Batch 6. A- 500ml bulbous bottle to a snifter with a deep cherry red body. A half finger foam pink cap with little retention. Lacing spots are rare. S- A boatload of cherries. Fresh black and red cherries, cherry jam, herbal fruit stems and leaves and some lactic tartness. A touch of funk and vinous oak. T- Big bold cherries and some sourness. The cherry flavor is extremely deep, fresh and complex with everything from juice to flesh to the stems and herbal notes. Lactic acid spurs, hints of lemon, raspberry and vinous oak tannins. MF- Light bodied with an oily slickness and fairly low carbonation. Sourness is medium high. A bit of a puffy texture. A ton of cherry, a bit of sourness, some barrel hints but lacks the complexity of the truly great American sours."
3287,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.62,"Bottle pour at 2016 O’Brien’s SDBW Lost Abbey Beer Dinner. A: Pours pale straw colored with a half inch of foamy head. S: Off dry, light brett character (horseblanket, earth), soft fruit (pineapple, orange, candied tangerine), some supporting vanilla and oak. Balance is towards the brett. T: Follows the nose, with light but firm tartness and moderate creaminess.  M: Medium-light body and carbonation. O: Tasty, elegant, and well constructed, though the flavors were a bit more muted than expected. Overall, I liked the Veritas 017 and 018 a bit better."
3288,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.12,"Poured into a tulip from the 750. Shared by a generous New Mexico BA.  Appearance was a thick and viscous and black as one would expect from motor oil or any big Bruery stout.  The smell was solvent as all hell and clearly suggesting some barrel and booze. Beneath were the pleasant dark chocolate and dark fruit notes one would hope for with the style.  Flavor was a huge turn in the right direction. Bursting with raisin and fig and enveloped in a rum flavor, this resembled some boozy Caribbean dessert I've had or dreamed of in my mind. I really loved the sticky raisin wine like flavor with the complements of rum. A friend accused me of harboring a soft spot for rum as the husband of a Dominican woman, to which I can only say yes I have a soft spot for Caribbean women. What was the question?  And as for how this drinks? Come on now. It's a Bruery 19er or something. It's thick as maple syrup and rich as all hell. Hard to complain about the feel and booze wasn't overwhelming the beer.  Very damn good."
3289,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.5,"Pour is black, leaking to dark mahogany on the edges, and a tan head. HUUUUGE barrel notes up front, then oak and coconut aromas follow. The barrel is prominent on the taste, but the oak and coconut mellow it a bit. The star of the show, though, is the turbinado sugar, which adds sweetness (duh) to the beer, but also depth and balance that really elevates this."
3290,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.5,There's a lot going on here and it's all good. To me chocolate stood out the most with cinnamon and coffee in the background. I was looking for a bit of spice but couldn't find it. A delicious beer but I think I prefer the simplicity of Morning Bell. nb
3291,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.44,"Can dated 3/30/21 drank on 4/6/21 L - Golden Orange, can’t get much better in this category S - a bit muted IMO, but improves as the beer warms. Sweet peach  T - TH describes it as overipe peach and I think that hits the nail on the head. Also notes of tropical fruit, but at 9%, definetly can taste the booze on the back end which took a bit away for me F - Classic Treehouse, Fluffy and soft, moderate carbonation O - A very good beer that has all the treehouse characteristics, just wish it wasn’t approaching 9%, as I think it comes through a little too much."
3292,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.18,"This beer sets my expectations for barrel aged stouts. It’s all there. The bourbon, the wood, the chocolate, the coffee, and the vanilla all mingle together wonderfully. I love this beer and all it’s variations."
3293,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.03,"22oz bottle thanks to Steve. First of the Jesus lineup. Normal inky black pour, small ring of head. Sweet, malty boozy aroma, molasses and wood. Taste is smooth, sweet and malty. Vanilla,brown sugar, bourbon. Syrupy and slick"
3294,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.68,"Bottled 9.18.20, opened 12.31.20 Bomber poured into a stemmed Schilling chalice . The bomber black wax coating is amazing with a “ ponytail” in the back  Two finger dense brown foam cap , good retention , good lacings settles to a solid layer over a deep, dense dark cola liquid  Aroma is chocolate, molasses, licorice, char, whiff of smoky peat Taste is roast malts , char, dark chocolate  Mouthfeel is thick , velvety smooth , the char taste is mild and nicely coats the tongue . Abv is invisible under this luxurious coating  Great beer, repeatable"
3295,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.99,"Pure black pour with a huge maple nose. Lots of maple flavor balanced with coffee. Thick, velvety mouthfeel that leaves syrup stickiness. Just a great beer!!"
3296,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.46,2019 release. Picked up a bottle at Hollingshead while visiting Orange on Beer Safari. Can always count on those guys. 
3297,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.47,"From a pint can into a curvy IPA glass. Fresh as morning dew. Cloudy dirty yellow color with a thin white cap. Light lacing. Citrus, fresh cut melon, pineapple, fruit mix. Grassy grains, dank in the form of herbal and botanical notes. Less like juice and more like a mix of the tropical fruits themselves. Thick. Well concealed abv. Some hop bite. As thick and juicy as it is, it transcends the typical neipa juice bomb and elevates the style."
3298,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.84,Absolutely delicious beer that I would love to have again. Poured thick and black with coffee brownie aromas. Flavors backed up the aroma perfectly. Drank thick with awesome coffee and chocolate flavors
3299,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.61,"Pours black with a finger of tan-khaki head. Head retention is good. Aroma is cinnamon, chocolate, molasses and roasty coffee with hearty roasty and toasty malts underneath. Bourbon accompanied with a heavy char kiss closes out the aroma. Flavor profile is chocolate heavy with cinnamon, vanilla bean and molasses. Roasty and toasty malts add the firm base with oats rounding out this sippable meal. Bourbon adds that spicy swell of heat, which is accompanied hand-in-hand with char. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, creamy texture. Overall, this is one incredible meal of a stout that's accompanied with a pinch of cinnamon and a swell of bourbon.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 22oz bottle. 2019 vintage, consumed & reviewed in 2020."
3300,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.65,Bottle shared at the RBSG 2012 Grand Tasting at the Bruery Barrel House. Pours that signature inky black with an otherwordly dark brown head. Delicious rich fudge and chocolate with luscious vanilla rounding out the body and a mild chili influence toward the back.
3301,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.68,"Why this is defined as a beer I have NO idea as it should be a liquor. Amazing alcohol content and it is certainly in my face. I had heard a lot about it and am certainly glad I was able to try it but would never shell out that kind of money to buy it. If it was $25/bottle I still would be unlikely to buy it unless I served it as an after dinner drink kind of thing. Sounds like I didn’t like it, I did, but it’s a niche beer for my tastes and it’s just not a niche I need."

3304,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.96,"Probably the best DDH NEIPA I have tried to date, and although I may not have tried everything under the sun that still includes quite a bit of the best!! So incredibly well-balanced, amazing smell and perfect feel and finish. Bought in Boston and drank fresh."
3305,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.84,"22 oz bottle Pours oil black, brown ring for a head. Aroma is of rich cocoa, coffee, pecan, walnut, toasted biscuit, molasses, and vanilla. Flavor is of molasses, fig, coffee, cocoa, pecan pie, walnut, oak, oatmeal, and bourbon. Full viscous body, tingly carbonation on the tongue. Boozy warmth going down. Exceptional. One of the best stouts I've had in a while. Great appearance, great flavor, very slow sipper to enjoy over time. Get it if you have the chance."
3306,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,3.84,"A weird airy spit bubble head quickly dies off in fits and starts over an opaque Tang and mango puree looking dark neon orange body. Spicy, peppery and dank allium pairs with tropical citrus and a hint of cracker. The hop overload brings an acidic sharpness. The medium-thin body is crisp and finishes paper dry with a little heat and a piney aspirin bitterness."
3307,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.38,"Canned on 5/24/19; consumed on 5/30/19 Pours a slightly cloudy golden dark orange body topped with a fluffy, tightly composed white head; excellent retention recedes evenly to a thick cap and uniform tapestry of lacing. Aromas burst with deeply juicy resinous tones of pineapple, papaya, and tropical zest; a beautiful honeyed orange highlights the bouquet upfront; occasionally dense bready spice and corn flakes pop on the backbone to support the deep citrusy sweetness with a deft herbal touch that defines the aroma. Taste follows the bouquet with plenty of orange peel, orange honey blossom-coated malt, and juicy pineapple; pine and grapefruit combo appear for a citrusy-herbal prickle, while a faint, flaky malt builds, and a slight, cirusy creaminess both ties things together and gives the profile new life entering the finish/swallow. Mouthfeel shows a body on the lighter side of medium and lifted by a creamy but slightly prickly carbonation; oily resinous tones hold until the mid-palate, where a dense crispness based in the taut balance of malt and hops takes over; well-tamed bitterness peaking near the finish that dries subtly as the crispness peaks. Endlessly drinkable and packs incredible depth into ~6%; undoubtedly sweet in its fruitier tones, but a calmly balancing malt and bitterness holds everything together effortlessly and brings this brew to the next level; a spectacular IPA for all occasions."
3308,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.43,"750 ml bottle into a snifter. Had 4/19/19. Pours near black and opaque, with a half inch head of darker foam and some cling. Thick and oily looking. Aromas of espresso, coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, fudge, toffee, caramel, some smoke. The flavor is the same- roasted malt, espresso, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, fudge, some cocoa. Very smooth, creamy, a great full body, well carbonated. What a great beer. The espresso sets this apart from most coffee stouts, and the overall aromas and flavors are pretty intense. Keeps getting better as it warms and has such a nice feel. Well worth a purchase any time it comes around."

3310,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.47,"The beer pours a Clear yellow with a medium white head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells apricots, apples, floral, fresh cut grass, and funk. It tastes very tart, with apricots, apples, floral, and funk. The body is medium with a dry finish. A great wild ale from Sante Adairus."
3311,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.77,Had been saving this one to share with a friend for quite some time and we finally had the time to get together and drink it! This one did not disappoint! Deep purple hue and mountains of fruit!! Probably the best Berliner I've ever had! Amazing stuff!!!
3312,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.5,"Did the children have a good week in Mantucket? Was it a long ferry and drive back? Was there too much going on unloading the car and getting the kids into bed and putting stuff away? Thanks, Haze. Solid straw gold look, with a 1/4” head on a soft pour and 3/4” with a second hard pour in a tulip glass. Lacy foam coating the glass during the 2nd overtime Dallas win! Nice citrus and sweet flavors coming through, passion fruit or papaya. The hops barely comes through and nicely controlled. The aroma is ne dipa all the way, citrus, peachy, papaya, mango. Nice finish, on the drier side. Double ipa? You would never know it, not boozy and immensely drinkable!"
3313,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.74,"Nom nom nom nom nom. I recently had tried Triple Shot on draft at Tree House, and brought back some cans of Double Shot to try at home. Triple Shot definitely has more coffee flavor, and was maybe a touch smoother, but Double Shot is still phenomenal. Rich, smooth, and the booze is hidden perfectly. A top-notch stout!"
3314,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.49,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Bottled 10/16/18, had 12/3/18. Pours a very dark, opaque brown, a little oily looking, with a half inch foamy head and soapy lacing. Aromas of bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, cocoa, molasses, char, raisins, some toffee, a little tobacco, some oak and smoke. The flavor is similar- bourbon, roasted malt, oak, molasses, char, raisins, some vanilla and caramel, light figs and tobacco. A decent amount of bitterness on the finish. Smooth, a solid full body, well carbonated. This is so well done, glad I finally got to try it. The excellent barrels only enhance the bold, trademark, roasty character of the base beer. Well worth a purchase if it comes around again."
3315,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,3.08,"10/15/18 batch, updated rating and review... .my Prior rating was 4.7, this was the first trillium beer I ever had and it opened my eyes to the unique flavors that hops can impart on a beer. what a disappointment ... a formerly magical and uniquely flavorful beer is now a heavy, overly sweet and muddled mess Look is dark.. pour yields very little head, a small ring remains Smell : surprisingly muted , very little tropical or juicy characteristic.. I almost get a rotten citrus smell  Taste- at once sticky sweet (which this beer never was before, despite its high abv) and bitter . With this hop combo I expect that classic trillium magic (and I could allow for a bit of hop burn), but this is just sharp, bitter and unpleasant to drink. No single fruit characteristic comes to mind- it feels like a huge mouthful of extra sweet jolly ranchers mixed with garlic cloves .. it tastes thick, chewy and muddled— galaxy and Columbus hops flavors are completely buried Feel: harsh, mouth-coating unpleasantness ; surprisingly thin for such a high abv. IF this is a result of the new fermentation profile, this is a major disappointment and has confirmed that trilliums beers are no longer for me. Never thought I would have such a strong opinion about a beer"
3316,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.93,"Pours a weird orange/pink/gold with medium carbonation. Vintage is 2018, picked up from the lambic-o-droom in late 2019 and smuggled back to the USA. Aroma is tart fruit. Taste is much the same with a nice acidity. Fantastic balance between fruit, acidity, complex sour beer. Just a fantastic beer to sip through. Complex and refreshing at the same time with fruit hanging out but not taking center stage."
3317,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.75,"Excited to try this. Expectations high given its reputation. On tap at BeerShop, NYC."
3318,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.49,"Deep hazy orange gold color with white cap and lacing. Aroma is ripe citrus forward with a sharp herbal background. The scent is rich, heady and earthy like the grounds of an orchard with ripe fruit strewn about. In taste the citrus is more tropical without losing it's sense of depth. I also get something more melon like in the flavor like ripe honeydew that lends fullness and balance to the rich citrus/hop mixture. Full, soft, velvety texture with balancing carbonation. A remarkable beer with an impressively balanced range of flavors."
3319,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.01,Huge head as I had kicked the keg. Slow to recede leaving lots chunky lace in the form of blankets and thick streaks. The liquid is milkshake cloudy with white hued lemon color.  Spicy and floral hop aroma. The malt smell is neutral and certainly lighter than the hop.  Dry malt start which enhances the strength of the bittering hops. The body is average with an elevated carbonation level. There's a strong alcohol presence. The finish is astringent and bitter but not in an extreme way. Soft lingering aftertaste.
3320,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.56,From a fresh growler:
3321,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.72,Pours and orange hazy color with moderate head retention. Smells very citrusy with some mango notes. Tastes a lot of grapefruit with this beer with a moderate bitter finish. Moderate mouth feel with perfect carbonation for this beer. Another excellent Alpine offering.
3322,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.6,2019 version poured from a 12 oz. bottle on 1-27-19.
3323,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.51,"2016 Vintage. Poured with quite a bit of sediment(floaties)...this is a dangerous brew, the alcohol is barely noticeable. Delicious brew and very chocolate forward. Only marks down was for the sediment, wasn't expecting as much as there was."
3324,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.39,"12oz can. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a small, off-white head of foam. It smelled of pine, citrus and caramel. Big piney bitterness with roasted caramel malt and sweet citrus."
3325,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.67,"I thought this was really interesting. Chocolate, bourbon flavor comes through, and ends sour. Think chocolate covered cherry dipped in bourbon. This was not overly sweet, but had a great balance. An exceptional beer that I haven't seen done before."
3326,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.58,"22 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Near black with a thin tan lacing. Nose: coffee-forward but still with a strong bourbon and oak presence.  Taste: coffee up front followed by bourbon. Some dark fruit and more coffee in the finish. Great depth and balance.  Feel: medium-full body, medium-low carbonation."
3327,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.38,Bottle Date: purchased a month ago
3328,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.94,"The beer pours a Clear bright yellow with a thin white head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of citrus, lemon, oak, honey, vanilla, and a little brett."
3329,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,5.0,"Dark cola with a mocha head that quickly recedes to an ever-present ring with no lacing. Thick heavy alcohol legs coat the glass when titled. Aroma is bourbon, maple syrup, and chocolate. Taste is sugar, big time chocolate, cinnamon, bourbon, and habanero in that order. It is very complex, and the flavors compliment each other instead of conflicting with each other. There is a long lingering peppery burn which makes this beer standout to me in comparison to Hunahpu’s and Abraxas. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and coating. Overall this is an absolute treat. I love the base beer, but the Maple Bourbon barrel treatment makes an amazing beer world-class."
3330,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.55,"335ml bottle - 20.12.20 (so exactly 3 years old) - poured into a Chimay goblet at 40°F, allowed to warm. 2020 Christmas bottle #2 Thanks Bobby. Pours an opaque, muddy maroon-mahogany brown, topped with two fingers of foamy beige head with some dark cinnamon swirling, and remarkable retention, and a collar composed of massive bubbles, fed by plentiful streams of effervescence. A few small floaties are visible.  Nose: This is a very difficult aroma to describe, because it's so unique and unusual, and unlike any quad I've had. Incredibly nutty and complex - sweet toasty malts with notes of brown bread, concord grape, fresh and dried figs, raisins, dates, prunes, with baking spice notes of nutmeg, allspice, and candied ginger. Some molasses, brown sugar, and distinct leather, and some bright fruity red apple and pomegranate cutting through. It's a truly remarkable aroma.  Palate: Westvleteren 12 greets the palate fairly dry for a quad, opening with fresh dark bread, a big nutty maltiness, and a bright fruity element that reminds me of cognac - fresh red apple, red grape, raisin, plums, figs, and persimmons. These fruit notes become darker and more like dried fruits, with prune, date, and raisin, before this incredibly exotic malt note appears - leather, vanilla bean, age, old wood, Irish whiskey, caramel, almond, toffee, and nougat, yet still decidedly dry. A herbal bitterness begins to develop, perhaps just a whisper of licorice, with gentian root, bitter herbs, grass, and a distinctly German hop spicy leafy note, with a moderately bitter resinous bite. This hoppiness lingers for ages, with whispers of everything that came before it slowly fading in and out, finally finishing with a unique earthy flavour.  Medium-bodied, with no stickiness at all. Both Rochefort 10 and (especially) St. Bernardus are fuller, heavier, and stickier. The dryness here allows it to be supremely drinkable, with a nice presence, but never fights back. Beautifully lively and fine effervescence lends plenty of lift and cuts right through that 1.2% ABV. Hearty, fluid, wholesome, quenching, bold, crisp, malty and dry. Overall: In a word? Beautiful. This is a beautiful beer, with an incomparable malt profile, a unique bright fruitiness, crisp dryness, and intriguing complexity. It reminds me a lot of old cognac, and the malt base has similarities to classical English barleywines. I can see why this one is so revered. Between Rochefort, Bernardus, and this, this is probably the most enjoyable (to me), followed by Bernardus, and then Rochefort. It feels masterful and dialed in - like the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I'm privileged and grateful to have enjoyed this one, and I think it is worthy of its accolades. Enjoy this one with food if you can. Enjoy the experience - take notes, review later."
3331,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.33,"nothing but fresh, hoppy dankness coming out of this glass. pours an unfiltered golden orange, hop flower aromas wafting. more complex nose in the glass, plenty of tropical and citrus. drinks great"
3332,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.29,"Pours a hazy straw color with a finger of head. The nose has bold notes of citrus (especially lemons) and dankness, as well. The flavor is juicy with a hop bite that is more potent than most offerings from this brewery."
3333,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.43,"Every Summer, I make this frustrating mistake of thinking that I’m actually going to spend the entirety of the three four high climate months crushing can after can of refreshing Pale Ales or IPAs. This misconception usually results in me doing something stupid like buying multiple four packs of the same beer thinking that the hot weather will help me power through the beers, and make them feel enjoyable all at the same time, while completely discounting such variables as (1) the fact that the human appetite decreases during warmer seasons; (2) my taste buds seem to get burned out from hops a lot faster in the summer; and, (3) regardless of the season, I’m usually too tired to drink a large quantity of beer after work, so I tend to reach for the higher ABV beers than the lower. So until those three variables are somehow resolved internally, I usually find myself doing the exact opposite of what I think I would normally be doing in terms of drinking during the Summer months: instead of crushing session IPAs, wheat beers, and bretty saisons, I end up fruitlessly trying to solodome bombers of BA stouts and passing out with over half the beer still left in the glass; or drinking one 12oz bottle of a high ABV stout and trying to start another lower ABV IPA and then passing out with over three-fourth of the beer still left in the glass; or actually finishing two tall boys of an IPA, going to bed at like 12:30 AM and waking up tired and hungover. My idiosyncratic drinking habits formed from my highly functional alcoholism aside, it seems like a single 16oz can of a moderately high ABV stout is usually right around my happy spot of where I want to be when I’m too tired to do anything productive yet not tired enough to go to sleep—lucky for me my favorite brewery has made the ingenious decision of canning their most famous beer in tall boy format; unlucky for me, it’s so rich it’s almost taken me 5 weeks to finish a four-pack by myself. When I heard that Mikerphone and Great Notion were brewing beers together, I was kind of hoping that their love child would be a cross between Smells Like Bean Spirit and Double Stack, kind of like what EvilTwin did with Westbrook with Imperial Biscotti Mexican Cake Break, but with less spice and more maple. And much less sticky cloying sweetness toward the back. I think they ended up putting out some strawberry IPA which I didn’t try because well, strawberry and IPA are not two words I ever want to see in the same sentence, as well as an imperial stout with peanut butter and marshmallows because I think the bottles were only put out in Chicago, and it was only briefly on tap if ever."
3334,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.66,"Bottle purchased for onsite consumption at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, VT. Batch 6, looks to have been bottled in 2014? This one pours with a slightly hazed straw yellow color, with a bit of fluffy head and a little bit of lacing. This smells like funky lemon candy, wheat, oak, earthy white wine, and dank citrus. This is exceptional, especially at this advanced age (4+ years). It's got such a deep citrusy funk, wheaty and floral, with a great oakiness. It's so wild and untamed, but also delicate and soft. This is pretty light bodied, but very creamy and unbelievably drinkable. If this wasn't so difficult to acquire, I'd drink it everyday. This beer is impressive both in the depth of flavor and it's long term aging ability."
3335,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.55,"Canned on 3/10/21 and enjoyed in a tulip glass. Pours a murky orange color with minimal head but some white lacing that coated the sides of the glass. Really enjoyed the nose of this beer: overripe mango, pineapple, juicy peach, apricot, nectarine. Really thick and syrupy mouthfeel not surprising for a TIPA. Hardly can tell it’s 10+% ABV. This beer has practically ALL the hops, which I thought was kind of a cool concept, given the nod to the Trillium ‘street’ series. This is the first time I’ve tried this anniversary beer and I really enjoyed it. Definitely one that needs to be sipped and savored. Not one I’d necessarily put in a regular rotation if given the opportunity given how heavy it is, so it’s probably fitting that it’s a yearly release and kind of a celebration beer. For now, I’ll enjoy the 3 cans remaining after this one until next year. Cheers."
3336,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.89,Draft in Pittsburgh
3337,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.44,"02/2015 - Pineapple and mango fosho with mild pine, dank aromas; fruity, juicy, nice hoppy tang, tropical fruits on the palate; sweet, wee bitter, clean finish though."
3338,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.21,"Canned on 10/11/18 Pours opaque, glossy honey gold with about a finger of pillowy, white foam that recedes pretty quickly in favor of thin layers of sticky lacing. Aromas of raw honey meld with dank hops for an absolutely pungent bouquet forming notes of herbaceously sweet sugar cane and lighter notes of rubber; powerful stuff, and definitely an aroma I’m finding personally polarizing. Taste brings plenty of herbal hops to start, building slowly in honeyed sweetness and saturating further tones of hops, pine, grapefruit zest, and mango to an effect similar to the aroma. Mouthfeel has a medium body with well-balanced carbonation, and actually reveals a certain level of prickly hops to the finish; little to no bitterness, and surprisingly trending toward light on the palate. Maybe the most polarizing NEIPA I’ve tried to date; I tend to like IPAs on the pungent side, but the honey really brings this to a new level, one that is equal parts confidently herbaceous and dramatically too dank."
3339,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.71,"I have had Dorothy before and think it’s wonderful. This bbl aged, dry hopped version is spectacular and I am so glad I shared it with a friend who appreciated it as much as I did. Smooth and tasty. To be sipped and savored. My taste buds are overwhelmed. Yay HF"
3340,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.5,"Poured out a golden-yellow color with some haze and a small white head. It smelled of lemon, acidity and white wine-like notes. Some sweet caramel, tart and acidic lemon flavors. Crisp and sharp."

3342,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.64,"This beer pours a dark purple to brown with a small white head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of dark grapes, black cherry, port, bourbon, and cinnamon. It tastes of dark grape skins, black cherry, port, bourbon, and cinnamon. It has a full body, with good complexity. This is s great sour from Cascade."
3343,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.56,"Batch 1, delicious. Maple and Coconut take the show, Coffee and Vanilla more in the background. So glad to be able to have this great stout. Thanks Tim!"
3344,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.32,"Pint can - dated 04/30/20 - poured into an IPA glass at 38°F.  Pours a near-crystal clear earthy pale amber hue, topped with three fingers of dense, sticky, pure white head with excellent retention. Plentiful visible effervescence. Very nice lacing left behind.  Nose: Very similar to Sip of Sunshine, but more Pliny. This definitely has more of a malt presence than Sip. Light notes of caramel and brown sugar beneath big Pacific Northwest hop notes. Lots of pine, lots of hoppy resins, huge grapefruit, some stone fruit in the form of peach and mango, a touch of tropical pineapple, and some earthy dank Simcoe. It's surprisingly subdued - not as in-your-face as Heady Topper, but a similar profile. Not as fruity and ""New England"".  Palate: This is where it gets interesting. I was beginning to think this would just be a maltier Sip of Sunshine. No no no. First sip, and I'm immediately taken back by the punishing bitterness. It holds no punches, and immediately slaughters the palate with biting, resinous bitterness right from the start. This thing is hopped to high hell! It does have a fuller, bolder, sweeter malt presence than Sip, but it needs it to support that insane bite. Flavour-wise, lots of caramel malt up-front, and then pine sap. Resinous, piney, bitter pine sap. There's a big pithy grapefruit note as well. Just about as bitter and pithy as biting into actual grapefruit rind. Holy moly! There are whispers of fruit notes beneath the assault of all things hoppy and bitter, with the suggestion of some peach, apricot, mango, and pineapple, but that's quickly whisked away when that signature earthy boiled Simcoe note comes in, giving a huge nod to Pliny - if Pliny was on that Barry Bonds love potion number 9 joose. It's like getting pulled over after a high speed car chase even though all you did was run a stop sign. Sure, you can surrender, but you're getting pummeled either way, and it's gonna hurt. It finishes, leaving you somewhat violated, with that earthy dank Simcoe, pine sap, and pithiness, now without the grapefruit flavour. The bitterness claws into your tongue, eventually fading away, like the heat of a bhut jolokia. Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is fairly full, in part due to its malt base, but even without the weight of the malt, with a level of bitterness like a kick from a mule straight to your Naddy Daddies, this one will stop you like a .50cal Barrett. Not a midsummer day quaffer. This is for when you want it to hurt, and you want it bad. Effervescence is fairly lively, once you survive the bitter assault long enough to realise it's actually effervescent. Very little malt cloy or cling, but it leaves a kiss of stickiness on the lips, and of course, the bitterness lingers with no sign of leaving, like a transient after you've said, ""Sure you can spend the night in my basement and not do any drugs at all!"". Typical classic double IPA body, with typical classic trouble IPA bitterness. Some hop burn will in fact start to hurt the upper hard palate after a while.  Overall: Goodness gracias my I have another, señor?! This one really packs a hidden whopper, and not like those chicks in Bankok either! On the surface, it masquerades as a harmless little hybrid double IPA, but then when you taste it, there's clearly something very different about it. It really shares a lot in common with Pliny The Elder, in terms of its flavour profile. It has those signature SoS/Heady colours, but the bitterness here is on another level, really making this a beast all its own. It's a fantastic beer, and it's certainly unique. If you want a classic OG hop assault, and you have the grip not to drop the soap, give this one a try. ...just don't say I didn't warn you..."

3346,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.66,"Rich vanilla nose, chocolate, slight booziness to it. Big dark chocolate and cinnamon on the tongue, finishes with a slight kick. Definitely a well layered balanced beer, however I would have preferred a slightly higher bourbon profile on the nose and taste."

3348,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.96,Had this alongside the Imperial Apricot Bu. This one wasnt nearly as tart when but it got considerably more tart as it warmed. TONS of peach on the nose and palate here though and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Total Peach Bomb!
3349,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.52,"L - Pitch black appearance with brown edges and less than a finger of brown head S - Coffee, vanilla, lactose, caramel, roasted malts, dark chocolate, iced coffee, hazelnut, peanut butter T - More of the nose, but this is very sugary. Milk and dark chocolate, rich, dark coffee. Vanilla and lactose. Muddled sugar and ice. Caramel, butterscotch, black cherries.  F - Silky and calm feel with no carbonation. Can be sticky and cloying at times. No alcohol warmth. O - Superb dessert beer. Might be too sugary at some points, but is complex and tasty."
3350,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.39,"A 750ml corked and caged bottle, 2015 project. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass. Appearance: A cloudy dark maroon colour with a one finger tanned head that dissipated quickly and left only sparse lacing. Aroma: Cherry, mixed berries, acetone, oak, wood, with slight balsamic notes. Taste: Sour, tart, cherry, caramel, oak, wood, mixed berries, grape-y vinous, with very light notes of bourbon. Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with moderate to soft carbonation. Overall: Not getting much bourbon, but there was an enjoyable complexity about this beer with a good blend of fruit and wood. At 9.9% abv, the alcohol was well hidden. This was definitely one of the better Cascade beers I’ve tried."
3351,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.09,"355 ml bottle, 2017 release, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11.7%. Pitch black colour. moderate tan head. Nice aroma of roast malts, maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and oak. Sweet flavour with the same elements as the aroma, some bourbon whiskey and bittering hops in the finish. Impressive beer."
3352,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.5,"Canned 6/22 Fresh, lush, and softly vibrant. Lightly sweet overall with an abundance of tropical fruit and citrus, all perfectly ripe. Full bodied and creamy, damn good."
3353,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,3.46,I want more funk. The raspberry character is big but the beer lacks depth. Would love to get some musty barnyard or brett character to provide some dimension. Wouldn't buy again.
3354,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.09,"330 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 13.0%. Pitch black colour, minimal brown head. Aroma of roast malts, bourbon whiskey, oak, chocolate and vanilla, a hint of fusel alcohols. Very moderate carbonation, but not lifeless. Rich and warming mouthfeel. The flavour has the same elements as the aroma, but is not too sweet. A very good beer, but personally I prefer the ""ordinary"" Speedway Stout."
3355,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.74,Barrel comes through nicely and a solid boozy note. An underlying fruitiness which mixes well with the chocolate and vanilla. Warmer it gets the more the fruitiness shows up and the more I like it. Don't get 18% ABV at all. Slow sipper.
3356,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.71,Look: Yellow hazy with small white head. Has low carbonation.
3357,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.82,"Opaque yellow with a large eggshell blanket. Smell is very strong apple and fresh nectarine. Peach overload! Taste is, very simply, exceptionally smooth, soft, fresh peach. Skin and all. With such perfect execution, it brings me to a point where I wonder, should I just be eating a peach? But then again, if I were to eat a peach, would I enjoy it as much as I enjoy this? No, I think not. Slightly tart but smooth and dry. Scrumptious! --- I was fortunate enough to try a 2019 vintage in July 2020 and it was just as impressive. A phenomenal beer. de Garde is unmatched when it comes to any kind of stonefruit in any kind of sour beer, be it lambic or otherwise."
3358,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.73,Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a sour peach that is very mild and pleasant. Taste is a very nice sour peach.
3359,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.58,"Imperial IPA with all the trappings of a hazy NEIPA (that’s a GOOD thing). That haze is the first thing you encounter and it’s creamy orangey hue is very inviting. Like most Treehouse ales, the nose is just a delight. All the expected notes of citrus, pine and tropical fruit are there with a just subtle earthy dankness. The palate follows suit with more of that glorious funk and some subtle vanilla & caramel notes. Finishes so nicely you want another immediately."

3364,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.68,"Poured from a can (30Mar2021) into a wine glass L: pours a great, slightly muted orange yellow, totally opaque with a moderate off-white head (that’s the width of the glass, imagine much larger in a teku etc. Good and dense head with a more aggressive second pour). Some solid moderate lacing left with each sip S: huge aroma as I pour, just so much fruit. Nose in the glass I get rich tropical fruit notes, creamy orange, peach. There’s a slight sweetness but not overpowering, no real bitterness coming through. There’s a bit of hay? Some slight earthiness, bitterness as well as it’s warmed somewhat. More of the citrus sort, thinking grapefruit T: follows the nose wonderfully, big and rich fruit notes leading the way. Tons of orange and drippy/overripe peach to open, moves slowly to a mixed tropical fruit note while a slight and welcome bitterness starts to emerge. Label notes fruit cup, and after reading that feel the mango/peach/pear/cherry in syrup mixed fruit flavor. Long finish, that slight grapefruit bitterness carrying through. Not much of that abv coming through F: shockingly, disturbingly drinkable. Soft, medium+ body, medium carbonation. It’s one of those beers that just goes down so easily, pillowy and smooth O: not surprisingly, a truly world class beer. The flavor and feel are incredible, nose not far behind. Can’t put it above Very Green (my current goat) but damn this is excellent"
3365,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.42,"Pours a cloudy orange color with a decent off-white head with great retention. Smells earthy, nites of citrus, nice amount of malts.

Just a touch of booze on the finish so you know what you’re drinking. F: Medium weight with moderate carbonation, sweet to off-dry, a good side of syrupy. O: A west coast IPA done better honestly than most made in the region! Must try short list along with Pliny!"
3372,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.4,"Canned yesterday, the day I picked it up at the brewery, 12/21/17 Pours a decent fizzy foamy 1 finger head that fades at a med pace, a little lacing, super hazy murky orange-yellow color nose loaded with citrus and tropical, dankness, papaya, mango, pineapple, orange tangerine juice, a bit of biscuity toasty wheat and creamy as well Taste brings that initial typical Trillium flavor profile, citrus, big creamy wheat and malt base, little toasty, plenty of citrus hops, loads of orange juice, mango sorbet, papaya, tangerine, loads of pineapple, lots of pith and a bit of rind, candied orange notes, a touch of alcohol warmth later, fair bitterness throughout that creeps in a bit on the drier but mildly sticky finish. Mouth is med bod, creamy juicy, fluffy carb, little warming booze Overall pretty standard DIPA from Trillium, not that that is a bad thing, it's def a common profile for Tillium, but delicious nonetheless."

3375,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.65,"Quite possibly the best Barleywine I've had to date. Easily my favorite beer of 2015. So much barrel presence, oak, molasses, toffee, caramel, chewy goodness. So smooth, creamy, perfect carbonation level and dark fruit sweetness."
3376,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.87,"I finally landed this whale. I have wanted to drink this beer for the last five years. I am looking forward to this review. I popped the top off and a hiss emitted. The beer is 52 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer just glugged out of the bottle as I poured it into the glass. This thick beer produced a two finger dark brown head. The retention on the head is phenomenal. The head dissipated slowly and left no lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 38 nearly black. The beer is opaque.  The initial aroma I got from the beer is dark roasted malts, dark roasted coffee, and dark chocolate. Next, I smell vanilla, molasses, chili, raisins, bready, char, and leather. The beer has this earthy garden aroma that I get on the backend.  Holy Moly! The flavors in the beer are dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, chilis, vanilla, molasses, raisins, anise, char, leather, earthiness, smokiness, char, bready, and a vegetal note.  The mouthfeel of the beer is chewy and dry.  The body of the beer is full, low carbonation, and a full finish.  What an incredible beer. Knowing this beer being is not barreled aged is utterly amazing. The harmony in the beer is like a fine-tuned instrument. Beers like this are why I love Imperial Stouts."
3377,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,3.33,"Bottle, RBESG 2007 in Glasgow, Grand Tasting. Red colour, hazy. Strong aroma of ripe raspberries and farmhouse. Very sour flavour (vinegar), distinct notes of raspberries."
3378,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.15,"Black body, about 1 inch of brown head.  Aroma has a beautiful smoke and dark chocolate/coffee mixture. Heavily roasted malts and some ashiness. Barrel comes through very well. Charred oak and light caramel.  The barrel is upfront in the flavor. It hides a lot of the depth and complexity that the base beer had. I don’t get as much of the sweetness and the ashy flavor is a little toned down.  The alcohol cuts through that and leaves an acidic heavily roasted malt/coffee flavor on the palate. Lots of dark cocoa charred oak and light caramel. Creamy mouth feel with low-medium carbonation."
3379,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.56,"Yellow pour - great mouthfeel and amazing smell / lemons, citrus. Phenomenal Saison feel to this beer. Reminds me a bit of a dry Chardonnay wine. One of the best!"
3380,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.19,"Had this on 2020-02-02 near Pittsburgh, PA from a fresh 12oz bottle A - Clear gold with a 2-finger white head and very nice lace S - Ripe pineapple, mild-moderately dank, honey graham cracker. Aroma is pleasant but on the mild side. T - Candied orange flesh and zest, graham cracker, lots of vegetal/herbal fresh hop flavors. Low alcohol heat. Piney bitterness that pairs with the fruit sweetness for a pleasant finish. M - Medium-full body and light-medium carbonation. Oily and smooth.  O - Flavors are very well balanced and it is dangerously easy to drink. Good stuff."
3381,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.63,Got this as part of a pack as I was in line with many many autos. Didn’t really know this beer but am SO glad it came with beers that I was relatively familiar with. Smooth. Just wonderful. If it’s availability the next time I am able to get to Tree house I will get more and MORE.
3382,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,3.71,"big 2020 bomber shared amongst friends, hendry inky with a ruby outline. smell is choco and alco. taste is mostly choco with a tobacco and resiny finish; tons of hops"
3383,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.22,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Black body with a huge khaki head. Nice looking. I immediately smell bourbon. Strong acidity and roasted malt. Maybe cherries? Taste is much stronger cherry. Intensely sour. Overpowers everything. Some roasted malt and a little bitterness, but mostly sourness. Well carbonated. Medium body. Flavorful, but overwhelmed by sourness. I get none of the barrel in the taste, though."
3384,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.99,"The beer pours a clear orange with no head. It smells and tastes of tart lemon, rustic funk, Sherry, and light cheese. Funky, but well put together and very easy drinking."
3385,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.66,"Pours jet black with soft, tan head. Smell is quite surprising with an absolute smack of Swedish pastry kokostopp, which is coconut and chocolate. Notes of coffee, cinnamon, licorice, vanilla and some charred oak. Taste is superb with the kokostopp again, and notes of vanilla, cinnamon, maple syrup, coffee and chocolate with some spiciness hiding in the bushes. Quite boozy, but in a balanced way, intense but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and well carbonated. Overall, a fantastic stout, plain and simple."
3386,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.46,750ml bottle poured into a snifter
3387,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.59,"Beautiful beer. Pours a bright turbid straw yellow to orange. Thick bright white head on heavy pour. Nose is sherbet like. Orange peel and juice. Taste of citrus. Notes of orange, grapefruit peel, lemon zest and peaches. Honestly one dimensional as in I really only get those citrus notes. But they are huge! And delicious. Creamy silky body that’s easy on the tounge. Hoppy finish to close out this beer. Ya no kidding right? 8lbs per barrel so it better finish hoppy ;)"
3388,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.6,"Amazing beer, but the nose is nonexistent. Taste is so balanced with a great level of sweetness. Limited carbonation, and excellent overall. Had at Bangers in Austin, TX on the tap."
3389,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.46,"Pours black with a half inch khaki head that leaves very little lacing. Smells is very maple syrup forward with bacon, coffee and toast coming in the background. Tastes of maple syrup, coffee, molasses, toast, bacon, roasted malts, vanilla, milk chocolate and roasted malts. Full bodied especially for a porter, lightly carbonated, thick and creamy mouth feel, mildly bitter finish."
3390,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.27,"The Alchemist's Crusher is what craft beer should be all about -- seizing the opportunity to create something memorable, rather than adhering to comfortable standards. Poured from a 16 oz. can to a typical pint glass, Crusher took on a dark pineapple appearance. The smell was incredibly balanced and inviting. The taste, however, highlighted the experience. The piney/dank flavor (some hints of fresh scallion) was complimented by muted, citrusy notes. I'm a big fan of Six Point's Resin, but Crusher steps the style up a level."
3391,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.91,"This is an undead pale ale style beer (lol) with 62 IBUs and 6.5% ABV. I read the reviews on BeerAdvocate before buying it and was really impressed with its 100 and world class rating! I checked the canned-on date and found it was only 3 weeks old! I poured into a Teku glass (that my brother got me!) to enhance the aroma with the laser-etched nucleation sites on the bottom.  Look-It pours a beautiful orange-gold color like viscous honey in the winter. I see hues of cedar and magenta in the light. The head is thin and puffy white with an effervescent quality leading to thin and persistent droopy lacing on the glass. It has a slight haziness, likely due to all the zombies that they grinded up and put into this world-class brew (lol).  Smell-It has a remarkably rich aroma. I smell tropical fruits, citrus, honey, and half-baked bread. I get strong notes of tropical pith and skins such as overripe papaya skins, apricot, pineapple, and mango rind. I also get white pepper, green tea leaves, grapefruit, cracked rye, tobacco and pine. Taste-One of the most pleasant things about this beer is its clean flavor. There are no sticky, cloying, or syrupy malty flavors and/or textures. It is rich in tropical fruits, pine, citrus, and breaded malts. The citrus, pine, and mild sweetness from the toasty, bready malts hit first and then a piney hop resin takes over in the most wonderful manner. The slight bitterness lingers, and the effervescent pop mingles with it tickling your tongue. I sense a pithy texture on my tongue from the more prominent tropical fruit qualities of the hops. It has a medium-body and very smooth quality.  Overall-This beer has one of those rare professional qualities to it that you cannot quite put your finger on. It is well-balanced, delicious, juicy, nuanced, and complex. I agree with the overall rating of it at this time as a world-class brew. It is impressive for another reason. It is a pale ale, but drinks a bit like a west coast IPA! I am glad to have found this so fresh and suddenly. It definitely lives up to all the hype! Drink this one brain-dead or while eating brains! Lol!"
3392,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.94,Batch 4 L: pours very thick and dark brown syrup. A film of head for a brief moment then fades to a tiny ring about the glass. 
3393,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.91,"Wow. Just wow. I figure this has to be one of the first New England IPAs judging by the entry date. Canned 1/27. So cloudy I cannot see through it. Very similar in appearance to orange juice. Fluffy head that dissipates but leaves thick long lasting lacing. Citrusy and dank hop scents that punched me in the nose, and I liked it. Taste is a battle of titans-huge citrusy flavors duke it out with dank bitterness and it’s a fight worth being in the middle of. Big bodied, mouth watering, subtle booziness, mouth filling, extremely sippable. First of the long time wants from the box of Tree House I got this week, and I am NOT disappointed in the slightest. Damn great beer."
3394,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.6,"Poured from a 16oz bottle into a Bottle Logic snifter. Acquired in a trade.  Pours a deep black, oily body with a small dark brown head that reduces to leave almost no lacing or retention.  Aromas are packed with coconut, vanilla, bourbon, and light chocolate.  On the tongue is rich coconut macaroon, bakers chocolate, vanilla, fudgy brownies, bourbon, but not too sweet at all. I almost feel like I can taste the coconut husk here.. the coconut is very authentic, not overly sweet at all. Lightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decadent and rich, fudgy.  A really nice coconut stout - not artificial and not overly sweet."
3395,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.15,"Pours opaque black with no head, just a tight band around the edges. Nose reveals rich chocolate and ethanol. Taste expresses cocoa, cinnamon, honey and a kiss of heat. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation. Overall, a solid offering. I'm not a huge fan of chili stouts; however, this was pleasant and unassuming."
3396,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.31,"A- 12oz can pours into a tulip glass with a beyond midnight black body and a one finger crown. The head has a very deep tan-brown almost cocoa hue and a thick creamy texture. Great head retention and plentiful webs of lacing. S- Bold Bourbon barrel off the top with a huge hit of spicy and peppery whiskey with that nice charred oak feel. The barrel is very strong here with dark chocolate, roast barley, coffee, caramel and cocoa powder beyond the intense Bourbon. T- Again with a nice and robust Bourbon oak barrel with a big wood presence as well as massive whiskey. Brings some certain booze with it as well as spicy, peppery and vanilla notes. The stout below is a bit muted here and thats a bit surprising considering Ten FIDY is an absolute beast... was there quite a bit of Bourbon hanging around in the barrel? Cocoa, milk chocolate, bitter roast barley, char, smoke, coffee, brown sugar, toasted nuts and caramel come to mind. MF- Heavy body but the whiskey cuts into the heftiness of it quite a bit. Carbonation is very high for a large BA stout. Texture is puffy and frothy and it ends pretty hot. There is a TON of Bourbon in this brew. Whatever barrel this is from is an absolute powerhouse as a huge wave of peppery whiskey and burnt oak wood saturates the palate."
3397,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.64,"Editing this rating to see if it changes my status of having it on the Top 250 list. I drank this back in 2018, so I don't recall the tasting notes, but hopefully I'll now get a check mark next to it on the list! Haha!"
3398,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.64,"Coconut Vibes b2 Holy F'ing Coconut Batman!!! This beer is one step from just a straight up melted mounds bar in a glass. Fore sure different than anything I have had up till this point, but it does get a knock for also being the sweetest beer I have ever consumed. Luckily I shared with a few others, could not see drinking more thank 5-8oz's in a sitting."
3399,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.55,"9 month old bottle poured into a beer mug. The color is abyssal opaque black, motor oil pour, with a slick mouthfeel. Good dark brown head with awesome retention and lacing. The nose is heavy in molasses and maple syrup notes. The taste is heavy sticky molasses with strong bourbon and paky charred flavors, roasted wood, coffee, and a nice clean licorice finish. Its like drinking a liquid chocolate cake, if anything. This is an exceptional barrel aged stout, among the best I have had."
3400,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.56,"Pleasantly surprised on how much of a treat this was. Big thanks to VermontHiker. This was not at all what I expected, completely surprised me and the nose was really something to behold. Bottle date 2015 on this one, need a fresh bottle to see what all this time did to it. A lot of bread, grapes, grass, wine and hop bitterness in both nose and taste. The wine barrels seemingly diminish whatever profound tartness wants to come out and punch you in the jaw. I'll drink this again and again and again. This is a beer I'd like to drink every weekday on warm summer nights....for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as much as of their fire. JUICY!"
3401,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.65,"Finally got to try this classic and it did not disappoint. Like the most 3F gueuzes the smell is fantically laced with various funks and musts, oak is stronger than most pushing citrus and pear notes powerfully with floral and grassy undertones. Taste is the same but strong on the characteristic oak. Has everything you are looking for in an authentic gueuze, distinctively bold with the funk and sour fruit yet smooth. Oak really tempers yet enriches the gueuze bite on the finish. I like my gueuze rough and tumble but this is an elevated champion of the style that is so wonderful I can't help but be in awe"
3402,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.04,"750 mL bottle. Super hazy pale orange. Smells of oak and lemony acidic yeast. Peaches are kinda sweet smelling. Taste is pretty sour. Strong sourness. Must be the Side Project part of the collab... Sour peaches. Heavy oak. Pretty nice. Heavy peach and almost too strong of a sourness. Tasty, though."
3403,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,3.91,"L: slight haze, huuuggeee carbonation wow, fills most of the glass with sticky foam despite a careful pour. Light off gold light cream color, very sticky lacing S: huge aroma of tropical goodness, mango, papaya, clementine, citrus. slight booze hint, clean and inviting T: huge malt upfront, lots of english biscuity flavors. Don't love the malt profile, prefer a bit more crystal sweetness to the biscuit flavors, but the balance is nice. not cloying or overly sweet F: great mouthfeel, very light and clean with a nice getaway O: Oh my goodness calm down with these ratings! a very nice ipa but not anywhere close to my personal top 10-20 ipas, classic example of east coast- haze hype I guess, stilll a very nice ipa. The malt balance is great as are the choice of hops and the overall cleanness of the beer suggesting very adapt brewing methods and execution."
3404,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.48,"Pours a darker straw color with a hint of orange. Ample foamy white head lingers nicely. Great citrus aroma, lots of lemon, orange, some tropical fruit too. Very flavorful, lots of citrusy hops; lemon, orange, light grapefruit, mango. Carbonation is good. Overall an excellent DIPA. 4/15/21"
3405,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.52,Look...golden yellow with little haze
3406,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.21,"Poured at 54°, a dark tan flotilla of mixed bubbles sits atop black with ruby edges liquid; poor cap retention, incomplete thin ring; no lace, no legs on swirl. Aromas of cinnamon, allspice, sweet malt with a whiff of coffee; as liquid warms, raw wet coffee been and cooked green peppers. Taste upfront is semi sweet caramel and chocolate base followed closely by cinnamon; coffee hiding in the background; bitter roast; vegetables/green peppers backend with some spicy peppers in the finish. Medium body; smooth silky feel; light carbonation; some warmth from 11.5% abv; spicy tingle on tongue from Ancho Chilies. Overall this tastes fine, mostly chocolate base with coffee flavor in retreat; chilies sauce and cacao nibs with a mild cinnamon linger; very good, but this stout doesn’t hold a candle to Cake."
3407,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.5,"Picked up the 6, 8 and 10 all at once, a helluva deal in any circumstances.  This is the quintessential example of the quadruple, by any metric.  But this is not the best example of the quadruple, IMO, and I have said so much in a previous review.  But if you want a baseline for excellence, start here."
3408,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.54,"From bottle. This pours a beautiful amber-yellow in appearance with good bit of foam upon aggressive pour. Citrusy aromas burst which make their way into the initial flavor profile before the familiar onslaught of piney and bitter notes come in for the end. It's a top tier West Coast DIPA.... and it drinks like it, in spite of higher than expected abv. It does not come across as strong or boozy. It somehow maintains a 'smoother than expected' feel. It's a fantastic beer, and I look forward to trying this on draft one day."
3409,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.5,"Classic American IPA that doesn't shy away from putting Citra hops in the spot light. Equated to a boozier Zombie Dust that has traditional bitterness but approachable for people of all palates. Highly accessible in Ohio, making it an impressive go-to brew."
3410,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,3.85,"Probably the best/smoothest of the triple IPAs that I’ve had. With that said, the style itself is a bit over the top for my preference. The booze overpowers everything else. Some flavors of overripe peaches and white grapefruit but the booze washes over everything and lingers. Some residual sweetness with the boozy aftertaste. Overall probably the top of the class for this style but the style isn’t my preference."
3411,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.4,"Tartness up front that gives way to granny smith apples, tannic grape skins and funky Brett. A bit earthy. Complex. Slick feel. Crisply carbed and zippy. Semi dry finish. Perfect for a humid night like tonight."
3412,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.6,"Cracked at fridge temp and the gorgeous smell immediately escaped the bottle. Pours a beautiful reddish pink with very little head (despite an aggressive pour). Nose is dominated by raspberry. Also getting really nice notes of vanilla, funk, oak, and raisin. Taste is mouth puckering sour upfront. Wow! Tart, sour, raspberry, tree, oak, vanilla, yeast, and maybe a bit of sherry. The taste lingers on the aftertaste for quite some time. Such a gorgeous mouthfeel - somewhat dry. Overall, this is an outstanding beer. One of my favorites of this style from an American brewery."
3413,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.68,"On tap at Brewberry Bar in Paris, France. Poured in a 12.5cl tasting glass. Well well, the balance of this beer is amazing the wine notes and bourbon notes mellows quite well and go along the dark berries sourness of the ale with wonder. Amazing beer."
3414,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.33,Pours hazy yellow orangish. Nice white head. 
3415,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,"Look...The usual excellence of a NEDIPA. Yellowish murky, frothy carbonation"
3416,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.34,"had this on tap at the mule bar in Winooski VT.  pours an almost clear golden color, thin band of white head leaves some nice lacing.  somewhat mild aromas - pine, dankness, sweet malts, citrus peel, grapefruit, hint of ripe fruits. palate follows nicely, but is somewhat dominated by sweet and syrupy malts and booze. the booze is not astringent or bothersome, but definitely comes through as expected at this abv. caramel and honey malts play nicely with grapefruit, pine, floral qualities, orange, hint of ripe tropical fruits including mango and maybe a touch of pineapple. piney bitterness on the finish is well balanced by the malt sweetness. mouthfeel is medium bodied and syrupy... not on par with the pillowy NE ipas that I adore. overall its remarkably drinkable for the abv, and is not excessively boozy in any way. however the balance tips towards malty sweetness and alcohol over the fruity hops, and having enjoyed more fruit forward triple IPAs such as Sunshine & Peril, this isnt one I would necessarily seek out. still enjoyable and interesting to try!"
3417,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.68,"Rating the '14, drinking it side by side with the '17 which I would give a 3.75 at best...not sure what's up with the '17 or if I'm having a bad bottle. Drinking at Himmeriget (7/19/2017)"
3418,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.35,"Pours a hazy yellow orange color with a light white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet toasted malts, some floral and mainly citrusy hop aromas. Tastes mainly of citrus juicyiness, a hint of floral hops at the end of it. It's smooth, lighter feeling than it is, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, an excellent NEIPA, as usual from Treehouse."
3419,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.43,"Thanks to Mike and Josh for this one. A long time want and one I thought I'd have to eventually travel to CA for. Much appreciated. 4oz. pour into a Lost Abbey teku.  Pours a .5 finger pink, frothy head with average retention. Beer is a slightly cloudy stunning pink orange. Lacing is spotty and sparse with some stringiness and thin legs. Average save for the really pretty color.  Nose is cinnamon, cherry jam, light tartness, hay, and some funky, wed woodiness. Clean, fruity and very aromatic and appetizing.  Sweet cherry, cinnamon, red fruit syrup, lightly sweet and mildly tart in the middle. Great balance. More cherry, lemon rind, and hay at the finish with a sweet and tart cherry aftertaste. Really really good.  Light to medium bodied with ample carbonation. Dry in the mouth and puckering going down. Very refreshing. Sticky and dry finish with a messy and lingering aftertaste. Nearly perfect.  I thought Cable Car was a slightly above average American Wild but this is a completely different animal. The addition of cherries has given this beer a whole new dimension and makes it clearly one of the best in the style. Definitely worth the hype."
3420,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.26,"A: The beer is a little hazy amber yellow in color and seems to have a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high off white head that died down, leaving a thick coating of lacing down the sides fo the glass and several patches of bubbles covering the surface."
3421,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.55,"All black can with grey lettering is pretty sweet! Canned in 12/2019, and enjoyed about 5 months later. L: Caramel-coffee colored rocky head. Pretty creamy and sticks around for a while. Some solid lacing on the glass as well. No light passes through aside from around the edges of the beer when held up to the light. Not quite a black hole, but pretty close. S: Some nice vanilla and bourbon. A good amount of roasted malt too. T: Hits upfront with a good amount of vanilla, bourbon, and some caramel flavors. Most of the bitterness comes though as bakers chocolate, burnt sugar, and roasted malts. Alcohol and the 75 IBU is pretty well hidden. Bourbon is really well balanced and doesn't overpower the sweet and bitter flavors F: Nice big mouthfeel! Definitely not an overly sweet beer. Sugar and sweetness isn't sticky like other big stouts. Lots of warming sensations while drinking. Really enjoyed the balance in this beer!"
3422,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.46,"Poured from a bottle (bottled 12Sep2019 - #109, 18/19) into an apple wine glass L: pours a light and clear ruby orange with a moderate very slightly pink-tinted white head that fades after a minute or two. Very minimal visible carbonation,  S: great raspberry-forward nose, on a slightly funky and tart lambic foundation. Raspberry flavor is fairly sweet, makes me think of raspberry sorbet. Lambic funk has a bit of that barnyard/cheese thing going on, second fiddle to the raspberry (as is the tart aroma for that matter). Cheese funk and acidity ramp up now that it’s hit room temperature, raspberry still there but secondary T: flips here a bit, would say I get that lambic funk first followed quickly by the raspberry - or at least they’re neck and neck. More tart to open with a bit of cheesy funk at first, followed closely by that sweeter raspberry character from the nose. Medium finish that ends nicely tart and acidic, moderately drying. Once it’s hit room temperature the base beer shines through much more, leaving a yeasty note in the finish I wasn’t getting before. Great balanced oak character F: medium carbonation, medium- body, medium+ acidity a bit elevated as it hits room temp O: a delicious fruited lambic, captures the fruit well while staying true to the funky/wild parts of the brew. A pinch on the sweet side at first, as it warms up that mellows with the base lambic shining through more. Overall great, as I expected a delicious Belgian beer"
3423,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.75,"Batch 5. Thanks, Sam.  Sherry, almond skin, mildly oxidized honey, funk, lemon peel, a light sharpness, grapefruit zest. Light mushroom. The palate opens with a great blend of lemon peel and sherry, grapefruit juice and honey. The sherry adds an aged note that complements the lemon and grapefruit juice. Mild almond skin, light vanilla, soft lemon oil and grapefruit feel. Drying, sherry finish. Mild brine. Astounding."
3424,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.52,"Reviewing 2019 vintage. This pours thick and close to black with unsurprisingly poor head retention (that being said, I drank this out of a taster glass). Does not stop the nose from jumping out of the glass. Huge coffee and maple, as advertised, masking any potential aroma from the barrel. That trend continues into the taste - difficult to find the barrel even when looking intently for it. The coffee is very pleasant and plays well with the maple, which presents authentically and not as a general sweetness. Thick, smooth mouthfeel (again, no surprises here). Overall, this would receiving a rating bump if it wasn't meant to be a barrel aged beer. In that respect, it falls short, as the adjuncts and texture are the real star of the show here. Very cool to try, but not worth the price of admission these days."
3425,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.4,"A fantastic variation of the tried and true BOMB! I might rate the 2015 Pirate BOMB! over the Paradise, the Paradise does beat the 2016 Pirate handily."
3426,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.19,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 2/2/21, so heading towards 3 months old here. Looks pretty good in the glass. Thick hazy orange juice colored body. Nice bright white head persists as a thick ring and covering, leaving a layer of lacing. Dull citrus aroma. On tasting, dry hopping is noticeable, but not overwhelming. Smooth, light citrus touch, a little dry. Mouth above medium, finish dry, lightly juicy, and a little bitter. Overall, good drink, well made. But I still prefer the original Pseudo Sue over all it's variants."
3427,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.75,"The rating is from memory of tasting Westly 2014 (4/2016). Had Westly 2015 on 2 occasions and for me, even on a slightly fatigued palate, 2014 was far better."
3428,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.49,"poured into a pint glass via draft color is a deep hazy orange (neonish) smell is citrus fruits, mango and papaya  taste is sweet citrus  medium carbonation and full mouthfeel the S&S series from HF have all been exceptional"
3429,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.75,"I went in to this beer expecting a barleywine, because Anchorage - but I was pretty confused when it hit my tongue. Loads of rich, thick milk chocolate, vanilla, and coconut. The bourbon and oak are understated, but there - I'd like a bit more, so that the diabeetus juice doesn't quite overwhelm it, but it's still fantastic. I wish I'd bought a few bottles of this - blessed be the friend who shared with me!"
3430,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.66,"My 1500th rated beer. Canned 6/17. A yellow/orange cloud with a fluffy head. Smell is grassy, citrusy orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and lemon, a bit on oniony spice. Taste pops with a tangy zesty hoppy citrus juice, a dank bitter earthiness on the undercurrent. Light to medium bodied, mild alcohol presence, dry finish. Not the best Tree House I’ve had, but an excellent earthy variation on the New England style."
3431,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.52,"Fantastic NE IPA from Tree House. Full of flavor, great aromas and feel. 1/29/20 date printed on can. Pours a beautiful hazy slightly darker yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and some nice soapy rings of lingering lacing. Smells of ripe orange, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, papaya and some melon. Also creamy vanilla, malt, bread, floral hops and a little dankness. Taste follows the nose, excellent balance and drinkability, juicy and flavorful. Nice and creamy. Smooth sticky soft mouthfeel with very nice carbonation. A real pleasure."
3432,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.14,"Billed as a Triple IPA. I’m rating this as an Imperil NEIPA A: super murky burnt orange color. Some darker matte orange notes towards the center with some yellow up top. Head is a thin film on the sides of the glass; which I expected given the abv S: loads of tangerine, apricot, mango. Creamsicle, orange juice. Orange sorbet. It has that classical Trillium aroma T: tangerines, clementines, apricots. Lots of apricot. Candies apricot and caramelized oranges. Mango and orange sorbet, and a big boozy tinge. Strawberry kiwi and passionfruit. Big sweet caramel note as a backbone as well. This is a big beer and you can taste that. Some chalk and raw hops at the end as well M: medium chewy mouthfeel with low carbonation  O: it has some hop burn and some alcohol, but for a beer this big it is too easy to drink. Nice sweetness balances out the tropical hops. This is a sipper for sure, but a nice beer for a spring evening"
3433,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.65,"Bottle. I believe it to be 2015. Poured a ruddy, muddy purple. Almost wine like. A purple/pink frothiness that sits atop the beer. Aroma promises a very sour aspect to the beer. Earth, vinegar, wood, and of course, a mixture of ripe perfumey blueberries and underripe, tart blueberries. The flavor was probably not as complex as other Cantillon beers I have had but it was surely impressive and flooring. It starts off very tart. A bright pop of sourness that has a balsamic quality folds into a display of woody blueberry wine. I loved how dry it finished. Each sip was better than the last as my palate adjusted to the potency of flavor. The body was light and the tartness lingered. Probably won't have this again so it was definitely a treat."
3434,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.53,"Dark, rich, and delicious. Plenty sweet, but balanced and not over-the-top. All of the adjuncts come through with none overwhelming the others. I recently popped one of my last bottles (from 2019) and it is still holding up great."
3435,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.92,"What an excellent beer. Amazing nuance and waves of flavor. Perfect fruit balance. Very well done. Best beer at Shelton Bros ""The Festival"" 2017 IMHO."
3436,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.21,Nice sour qualities but on par with a lot of apricot sours. I dig the white wine barrel qualities. Quite full feel for a wild ale. Nice overall but nothing mind blowing particularly for the hype surrounding this one. As this warms the sour qualities become quite abrasive. Glad I split this between 4.
3437,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.0,"Extra mild, not much funk, tartness or sourness. Nectarines are fairly acidic and fruity. Lacks distinction - decent, not incredible. Fruit may have fallen off? I have to say, this disappointed me a lot. Granted, it may be significantly aged (unable to determine batch number) but it's just not that remarkable."
3438,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.47,"Batch 4 Very tasty beer, but I would be hard pressed to identify this as a saison. Tons of oak and white wine as it is young, but much less dry and more tart than a typical saison. The only hints of saison are a few possible notes of saison yeast on the finish."
3439,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,3.9,"L: Pitch black with a tall khaki froth. Little head retention and spotty lacing. S: Booze and barrel, bitter chocolate, dark roasted grains and beans, and some dates or other dark fruits. T: Pretty much follows the nose with more espresso and burn. F: Definitely a sipping beer. Huge, huge mouthfeel, with a long-lasting finish. Light carbonation and an almost velvety feel O: I imagine this one improves with age, but at 6 months in the bottle after buying it was still horribly hot."
3440,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,3.35,"Slight haze on the amber brew with adequate foam in the Piraat tulip. Inviting aroma of fermenting pineapple, orange, and a whiff of compost. Sticky and sweet. Tastes of bitter cucumbers with citrus peel. Endlessly bitter with an aspirin taste. This is a plain overdose of a perfectly good hop for no good reason. Quite a lovely aroma, but the woody, bitter, metallic, and astringent aftertaste is a little too much for my taste. Purchased for a rather ridiculous price from a West Coast beer boutique. From the 16 oz can dated 12/24/20 on the bottom."
3441,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.35,A: Murky orange/ gold with rich white head and great lacing. 
3442,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.75,Bottle pour at the 2019 Festival of Farmhouse Ales. This one absolutely lived up the hype. Perfectly balanced. The best sour beer I've had from Russian River and that is saying something.
3443,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.3,"Glossy black with a short mocha blanket settling to a soft persistent collar. This has an excellent balance between the wonderfully nutty, smoothly roasty stout body and the sticky, syrupy barrel character that dries out nicely on the swallow. The barrel provides Raisinettes, coconut drizzle, and bruleed toffee notes within the whiskey that's warming but measured. The body is actually moderately light and silky with a light crackly carbonation that comes to a semi-dry finish at first, but then leaves a light stickiness on the lips."
3444,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.65,"Had on tap at brewery August 2019 World class hazy IPA, well balanced and chewy, over-ripe fruit but measured so as not to be cloying, mild and appropriate hop burn/thickness on the back of the palate, highly quaffable. Seek out."
3445,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.59,"This is one the finest generally available non-adjunct stouts around (I had it on draft at Whole Foods). Rich, thick, dark, and chocolatey. The alcohol is there but not overpowering."
3446,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.2,"It's amazing to me how much more attention these fruited beers get. This is a fine liquid, but some of their standard stuff has so much more to offer on flavor, aroma, complexity, and mouthfeel. This is very champagne-like, and while I don't have a lot of experience reviewing champagnes, it has a dry bubbly effervescence, with some sweet tang in there as well. All the flavors marry to the point that it becomes one golden royal potion where nothing really stands out and says apricot, but it's there, in peach, pear, apple and even white grape expressions. The sourness is mildly oaky, tingly and faintly sharp on the swallow--it's so well developed that it really could be put up against some of the best France has to offer, but, what would I know in that regard. I rate beers. My first review was for the 2015 vintage. I've had multiples since then, but this final review is an amalgamation of all of them, capped off by a blend 4 enjoyed in May 2019."
3447,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.67,"L: Brilliant clear amber brown in color with a light lace. S: Very fragrant, powerful scents of funky sour cherries, grapes and plum.  T: Initial bright refreshing champagne-like start, it’s a split second of silence as your taste buds reset. As you wait for it, a smooth transition of flavors move towards the rear and to the sides of your tongue as you saliva glands get seduced. Flavors of sour cherries, nectarines, kumquats, apricots and plum emerge and give way to more complex flavors of oak, black pepper and tobacco as it stimulates your salivary glands, drying your mouth and making you thirst for more.  F: Medium bodied O: One of the smoothest sours I have ever tasted! People celebrate with champagne, if this bubbled like champagne, this would replace champagne. This is delish!"
3448,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.49,Got this one from desp59. Cheers!  From a bomber into a snifter
3449,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.94,"Wow, peaches for days! Poured from a bottle, hazy peach color and funky peach aroma. Was amazing at colder temps, and became more acidic as it warmed. Perfectly carbed, great collab between Casey and SP. Wish I could compare with the SP version."
3450,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.05,"The man with the plan brought this over to share a couple weeks back. Cheers dude! The label reads ""Kriek van Schaerbeekse Krieken,"" which is the same as this. If the two entries ever get merged, I figure it's safer to add the review here.  From a 750 into a tasting glass. "
3451,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.37,"one of the best looking beers ive encountered. moderately hazy golden orange color with bright white head that leaves insane amounts of lacing, each sip is a ring on the glass. aroma and palate is grapefruit, grassy green herbaceous note, resinous pine, bready and sweet malts - honey and caramel predominate, some hints of orange and citrus peel. overall this was an enjoyable brew, cheers!"
3452,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.6,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a wine glass. pours a beautiful dark red with pinkish white head. smells of blackberry jam with some acidic funk. taste is similar with the jamminess taking the forefront. this is some tart cider! sour and acidic. feel is appropriate for the style. not overly bubbly. definitely on the thicker side of things. overall, damn sour but one of my favorites of the SP 375s."
3453,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.63,"A 1 pint can, canned on 7th May 2020. Poured into a Holy Mountain tulip glass. Appearance: A hazy yellowish orange colour with a just over two finger white head that had good retention and left lots of nice lacing. Aroma: Sweet peach and apricot ice cream, mango, citrus zest, grapefruit rind, with notes of melon and dankness. Taste: Light to moderate sweetness, overripe mango, orange creamsicle, mandarin, grapefruit rind and zest, light to moderate lasting bitter finish. Mouthfeel: Smooth, light to moderate bodied with moderate to soft carbonation. Overall: Very nice and smooth. Sweet and bitter balance is perfect with lots of tropical and citrus fruits."
3454,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.72,Impenetrable black pour with a half finger of tan head. Full ring of carbonation and curtains of lacing remain
3455,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.41,Sampling a 12 oz bottle from 2016 bottling. Says 17.5% ABV on the label. Sounds like a winner for me!
3456,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,3.51,"Thanks to someone's sister for getting him one. Consumed next to 07, 08, 09 Cable Car.  A: A loud pop of the cork and a fountain of foam gushed from the bottle spraying the windows in front of the sink. We proceeded to let the foam-over pour and fill multiple glasses, but we still lost a good amount of beer. This beer is the definition of ‘gusher’. This beer is very murky, cloudy, and the color of pink grapefruit. "
3457,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.31,"750 ml bottle, ABV 6.2%, assemblage No. 22 - season17/18. At Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Deep golden to orange colour, small white head. Outstanding brettanomyces / ""farmhouse"" aroma, very inviting, also hints of oak, white wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar. Fairly sour flavour, complex notes of brettanomyces, oak and various noble vinegars."
3458,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,5.0,Great citrus aroma. Absolutely refreshing. Edit: to be fair this was the first ne dipa I’ve purchased and first ipa review. In fact I only happen to put this in my virtual basket order because I needed to meet the delivery min for my order of stout parabolas. The kind beer-smith threw these in to top off my bill. Wow am I ever grateful.
3459,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.49,"2020 waxed can release. A: Pours a deep, red-tinted cola color with foam that dissipates immediately. A bit murky looking. No lacing but extensive alcohol legs. S: Butterscotch, dark red dried fruit, leather, bourbon, a bit of vanilla, oak, cola, coconut, and ethanol burn. Pretty flavorful. T: Rich caramel, vanilla, red fruit, bourbon, a bit of chocolate, coconut, and oak, finishing with dark cherry and cognac on a long, elegant finish. Medium-high sweetness with a touch of tannins to offset it. M: Medium-full bodied, roundish, with a mild alcohol burn. Mild carbonation. O: Big, sweet English barleywine. Great red fruit, caramel, and barrel character, though the sweetness limits the drinkability quite a bit."
3460,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.53,"Appearance - The beer poured a silky black color with a dark tan head crowning the glass.  Smell - Coconut was evident in the nose, but did not jump out as much as I imagined it would.  Taste - As expected, coconut was a big part of the initial taste. Dark chocolate followed, seeming to be actual chocolate. The profile was very smooth with bourbon notes adding to the smoothness. There was nothing hot about this beer.  Mouthfeel - Little carbonation bubbles contributed to the silkiness. It was a step away from nitro.  Overall - I enjoyed the fact that the beer was not overly sweet. This one is a keeper."
3461,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.96,This beer was amazing. I sampled 6 of the Dark Lord variants including Marshmallow Handjee and French Vanilla Malitia. It was the best by far. Personally it stole the show at Dark Lord Day. It was even better than the 2017 version.

3463,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.47,A thousand thanks to larryi86 who hit me with this gem in NBS BIF #11 Nigel Tufnel's wet dream (this one went to 11!)
3464,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,"10/21/19, from a can released late September (~3 weeks old): 'Taste' rating upped from 4.25 to 4.5 for a touch more creaminess at the front of the palate, and some incense/onion/herbal hop tones further accentuating the back end. Balanced to the point of understatement, but enabling a level of universal approachability few NEIPAs reach (especially with a DDH treatment); this beer sits casually at the peak of the style, with few others as level or refined. "
3465,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.59,"Smells great, mouthfeel great. "
3466,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.87,"It took a lot to get one of these so I was anxious when I popped the top. I was happy to be greeted by a a funky raspberry aroma. From the smell, I thought it would be sweet, but it was pleasantly dry. What a great beer! My only regret was that I drank it too fast- so damn tasty. A trip to Austin is in order."
3467,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.34,"Huge raspberry, fresh dark chocolate, cocoa, light roast, sweet, some bourbon Unlike the fruited bcbs variants, the fruit is super up front and not really integrated."
3468,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.59,"Coffee black, albeit opaque, with a short but dense creamy mocha head that retains as a thin but fluffy blanket until dying to just a curled ring. The super round, lusciously fluffy medium-full body delivers creamy fresh vanilla whip swirled into the smooth presence of medium roast coffee exhibiting big punches of dark chocolate morsels all gliding along a tingly carbonation that recedes into a just semi-dry finish. The longer I dig in, the chocolatier and fluffier it gets, developing further hints of mocha liqueur and crystalized toffee or even peanut brittle, while also becoming a little sticky on the lips.  There's a little bit of a charred brown sugar element you might experience in Mexican coffee, and as the lactose builds on the palate it becomes tough to drink, even splitting the bottle with my old lady. I just couldn't wait to duo dome this bottle with her as fresh as possible after this b2 release, and it was not a disappointment. There's no question why this beer set off Trillium's pastry stout odyssey, as this b2 is no slouch and still the best pastry stout they've put out (with Biscotti & Coffee and BA Affogato being my other tops)."
3469,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.42,"Bomber batch 1: murky peach color, smells of acidic peach, lemon, and stone fruit.... Taste follows with a fairly strong sour component, peach, lemon, stone fruit and bourbon! Definitely sour, but rounded out by the fruit....nicely concentrated!"
3470,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.43,"I see that all of the other reviews ate from 6 years ago. It apparently has not been brewed for a while so it is possible that this brew is significantly different from the earlier one. Pours a hazy straw color with a large foamy head that ends as copious lacing. Smells of dank piney hops. Initial tastes are dominated by dank hops. As my glass warmed light tastes of citrus, mango and pineapple came out. Mildly bitter hop finish. The body is surprisingly light for a DIPA. Light carbonation. Light clean mouthfeel. Very enjoyable. More on the West Coast side of the spectrum than most NEIPA's I have tried."

3473,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.37,Tastes like a slightly underripe nectarine. Impressive fruit flavor and quality. Bright. Acidic. Dryness on the finish. Clean midpalate that isn't malty/juicy. Fairly tart but the fruit and base beer are still presented well.
3474,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,3.98,"Poured from a 16 ounce can into a tulip glass. Look- Dull straw, sudsy white head, hazy, average head retention and lacing. Smell- Grapefruit, floral. Taste- Overwhelming grapefruit flavor upfront transitioning to a herbal and slightly spicy finish. Feel- Between thin and medium body, high bitterness, highly astringent, average carbonation. Overall- Flavor was too one dimensionally grapefruit for my palate."
3475,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.24,"Bottled February 2016; drank 2/4/17 @ Golgi Apparatus.  Neon purple appearance.  No head; no lace.  Passionfruit, honeyed wheat & strawberry candy notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Passionfruit & honeyed wheat flavors up front; tart strawberry notes on the finish.  Pleasantly fruity; a touch too tart for me but way above average."

3477,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.25,"Gold In color and hazy in complexion. There’s a fingernail of off white around the rim. The aroma is an assault of apricots and a touch of brettanomyces. I’m tasting tart brettanomyces and apricots. The mouth is very dry, highly carbonated, and crisp."
3478,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.74,Look - just incredible thick black with a great tan head and great lacing
3479,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.36,"TRILLIUM CONGRESS STREET IPA 12/3/19 Canned 11/19/19. Poured from the 16 oz. can into an English nonick pint. a; Opaque orange with a half finger thick white head which receded to thick surface foam and dense lacing. s: Fragrant citrus leaning to orange and floral. t: Wet hoplike grassy notes dominate initially along with moderate hop bite. Dry finish with some lingering bitterness. m; Medium, good body and carbonation tingle. o: Unusual NEIPA with aromas which do not match the flavor. Somewhat reminiscent of Heady Topper but stronger grassy notes and less citrus."
3480,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.97,"The perfect blend of rasberry fruit sweetness, funk, and sour. Just the right ABV as well. Nothing much more to say but if you love wild fermented sours and lambics, this is a winner."
3481,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.54,Look - black syrup nice foam and film
3482,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,5.0,May be one of my favorites of all time. Lucky enough to have two bottles of this on two separate occasions while in Berlin. Muted Horn has an outstanding selection and partnerships with some of the best around the world. Must try/bucket list. I am not a fan of Brett but this beer is unreal.
3483,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.75,"2016 release, enjoyed in 2020. Light orange-golden, unfiltered but pretty transparent and bubbly. No residual lacing. Bright and floral, quite tart on the first sip, but sweeter and fruitier after that. Apricot, peach, grapefruit, bits of cranberry and granny smith. Light straw and funk underneath the sourness."
3484,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.44,"Had a fresh crowler of this on 4/8/2017 Overall this was a very enjoyable beer. It truly went down like a 7% beer, which was awesome for drinking it, however, it makes it dangerously easy to drink fast too. There is a really exceptional combo of sweet, caramelly malts and fruity, citrusy, floral hops. The flavors were fairly complex because of this and overall this was a really enjoyable beer to finally get to try. May be tough to chase, but very well done."
3485,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,2.95,"I used to LOVE this beer. 2020's release is not the same. Flabby, boring, no hoppy bite, malty finish. VERY disappointing. Only good for getting an expensive buzz."
3486,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,5.0,"First beer I've given a 5 across the board..best IPA I've had to date, this is a deceptive beer it drinks like a TH double IPA but is so slam packed with fruity hops and more hazy..oh yeah and it's 11.5%, I've never tried a beer that hides it's booze content this well, a hazy delight."
3487,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,3.94,Nose of fruit and slight piney hops. 
3488,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.88,"So it is a gloomy Friday approaching evening and thanks to Shayne Duggan I am drinking one of if not the finest breweries in the country. Pours a very hazy yellow orange with a finger sticky white head that yields excellent retention and leaves massive streaks of lace behind after every sip, canned on 11/11/19. 4.75 Smell is papaya, tangerine, mango, apricot, cantaloupe, blueberry, pineapple, and pink grapefruit rind. 4.75 Taste follows massive tropical fruit papaya, tangerine, mango, cantaloupe, pineapple, upfront with blueberry, apricot, and grapefruit shining in the lip smacking finish, really balanced and juicy as heck! 5 Mouthfeel is is big, sticky not dry, soft gentle carbonation, and at 8% ABV extremely drinkable but loaded with flavor. 5 Overall this is exactly what you expect from these amazing brewers and especially with Citra and Galaxy hops. Really special. 4.5"
3489,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.48,"Fairly fresh, aquired in a trade. No bottling date. Super tight white bubbly head on a beautiful yellow/gold slight hazy body (I like keeping in the sediment). Aroma is pretty standard, grapefruity, citrus, piney, but really clean and clear. Flavor is awesome, everything you’d expect plus a smoother honeyed and lactose experience that delivers the hops in a soft and creamier manner. Sooo smooth for a big DIPA. Unique given the familiar hop and malt profile"
3490,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.41,2017 - Green Wax A- Black with light brown head
3491,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.22,"My first experience of this was at Dark Lord Day, written below. I had a bottle at home so what follows first is my review of that 2018 bottle opened on Zwanze Day 2019.  Appearance is foggy vibrant burnt red with a tall uneven pinkish-white foam head that slowly settles to s thin film and creamy collar. Blåbær exhibits tanniny skins and hella oak that has a nutty splintery dusty character. The lambic has an olive brine funk and is more sour than other loons, but it needs to warm up to develop away from vinegar with more pleasant notes of red wine as the prickly semi-dry finish becomes smoother as it warm. In both experiences, I never really got a definitive blueberry character, but that has been the trend with many other blueberry lambics and saisons I've had across the board. --- Yep, I got to enjoy this lambic whale at DLD. It was fluffier than I expected, and expressed more oaky barnyard funk than it did fruit, but was quite enjoyable. I didn't flip my shit over it, but I didn't get a full glass of it either."
3492,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.29,"2020 version. Purchased in August at the brewery. Opened 2/17/21. L: Black. Really black. Surprisingly thick caramel colored head that only stays around the edge of the glass. Thin ribbons of lacing that go away. S: Bourbon, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, and wood. It's all there, and it's impressive. T: Sweet up front, bourbon in the middle, tamed by the cherry, chocolate and vanilla. More smooth bourbon at the finish. F: Medium to heavy body, but not as heavy as it looks. Light carbonation. O: Rich and complex. A wonderful example of the style."
3493,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.28,"16oz can, Tree House snifter glass. Cloudy golden body, standard pulpy Tree House haze, one and half finger white head, good retention, plenty of frothy lacing. Smell is dank citrus, a bit of herbal and floral aromatics, touch of sugary sweetness and caramel, Zest. Flavour follows, good balance of juicy citrus and tropical fruit, herbal spice, slight caramel. Smooth. Medium bodied, smooth and creamy with nice carbonation, mild herbal spice on the backend. Solid IPA, nice tropical fruit bite and the standard creamy Tree House body and carobnation."
3494,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.83,"12oz. bottle served in my Spiegelau tulip. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, 1/8th inch, mocha-colored head that disperses towards the edges. Nose expresses aromas of dark fudge and maple candy. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of roasted coffee and char; however, it all comes off a little watered down. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation. Overall, might be past its prime, but not overly impressed."
3495,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.55,"12 ounce can poured into a can glass. Had 12 of these now and they don't dissapoint. Orange amber, slightly hazy and almost 3 fingers of antique white foam that lessens to a perpetual cap. Very little lacing. Nose is light, citrus and clean doughy malt with a hint of pine. Taste is the same, hoppy citrus, clean malt, pine with a bit of spice. Good balance of bitterness and sweetness. Medium light in weight, crisp with underlying creaminess. Nice bitter hoppy finish. This drinks very easy. Not very juicy, more in line with early examples of the style. Well done."
3496,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.08,"A mix between a stout and a barleywine, lil roasty and underwhelming next to some of the biggest barleywines we had next to it blind. Not something I will be going after in the future."
3497,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.49,"Carbonation was a bit low with pour head retention. Not what I have seen with the other black Tuesday varients. Otherwise this is basically black Tuesday with the chocolate notes turned up to 11, which is not a bad thing."
3498,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.44,Poured from the 750 into teku glasses. 2010 vintage.
3499,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.24,"Had this at the Firestone Walker 2017 Invitational. The long line paired well with the hangover I was nursing in the heat. Pours innocent and yellow with a chunkee or two floating around and a super thin mild head that was gone before I took a sip. Wow, what a great aroma. Peach, brett, barrel, funky yet dry. Pretty top notch in that department.  Taste, oh man I could drill this all day. Nice soft white peach envelopes the mouth, not overly acidic or sour, just right. Carbonation on point, the nice little white wine notes are complimentary. It is definitely upper echelon fruited wild ale territory. Doubt I would ever trade for such a thing because it is so damn valued and there are comparable beers like this in my neck of the woods (De Garde- The Peach). Its almost as good as O'so's peach wild ale. So I'd say it is running #2 in the Midwest, which is still a huge compliment. Peach and sour fans will dig it."
3500,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.2,"Hazy apricot color with sudsy white head. Great retention and lacing. Aroma is just straight fresh hoppiness. Bitter everywhere; up front, in the middle, at the end. Some light waves of peach, pine, and mango, but bitterness dominates. Dry and crisp. Good carbonation. This beer is all about fresh hops. Usually not a fan of overwhelming bitterness, but this is a great beer."
3501,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.3,"Got to drink this at the second Firestone Walker invitational I believe. And then again in bottle at a March Madness event brought courtesy of leftpaw I believe.  Pours a used motor oil like color and consistency. Very small brown head on it, like 1/8"" Aroma of bourbon, baker's chocolate, fudge and alcohol, a little bit of roasted malt feels. Taste is pretty nice, plenty of chocolate, sugar, brown sugar, molasses, roasted coffee notes from the malt. Mouth feel has an appropriately lower carbonation and hides the abv quite well. There is a substantial amount of bitterness here. Its significantly better than the base version by itself. Tends to have more of a boozy quality than it does a bourbon taste. Really good stuff, but with so many bourbon barrel stouts out there, I have no idea why people pay/trade so high for it."
3502,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.36,"Copper to light brown in color with a hazy complexion. There’s a fingernail of off white covering a trace of the top. The aroma is of malted barley and wheat. I’m tasting malted barley and light wheat. The mouth is very light, smooth, and inviting."
3503,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.08,"2019 vintage. Pours deep brown with a small mocha head that fades fast. No lacing. Smells of chocolate, bourbon, coconut and faint maple. Taste follows the nose. I appreciate that the sweetness doesn't overpower.  On the thin side with low carbonation. Drinks nicely for such a big beer. A bit more mouthfeel would make this one upper tier. Really nice beer but not on the level of some others and the price point sucks."
3504,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.6,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, red session. Really hazy, milky, bright vanilla color. Aroma has bright apricot and peach notes. Taste is tart an fruity with yogurt notes and dry on the finish."
3505,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.0,"A: Thick and viscous. The poster child for motor oil beers. S: Apples, caramel, and cinnamon. The barrel influences are really obvious in the nose. T: Chocolate syrup, chili, apple. A bit of a messy combination. The apple and chili together is a little odd. Very sweet, dessert in a glass. M: Thick, thick, thick. Minimal carbonation. O: A really unique, one-of-a-kind beer. Worth seeking out, just make sure you've got a few people to split it with, because this is some thick, heavy stuff."
3506,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.05,"16oz can. Pours a hazy, dirty pale yellow with an inch of bubbly head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is sweet citrus and maybe some light floral hops. Orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit and some white wine as well. The taste is mostly the white wine along with some lemon and lime notes. A bit floral and herbal towards the end with some bitter citrus peel. Medium body with lots of carbonation. Dry mouthfeel."
3507,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.85,This is the 2021 version. I was lucky enough to grab a 4 pack so this is out of the can. Made this one last and it was almost like drinking two different beers. At first it was very oaky with some vanilla and more boozy. As it warmed up you could taste a little dark fruit and the vanilla became stronger. It also didn't taste as sweet as it got warmer. The whole drinking experience was an exercise in patience as i wanted to chug all 12 oz. But I'm glad I took my time and savored this masterpiece. Revolution just keeps one upping themselves with every release and I'm totally hooked.
3508,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.6,"Pours a dark black. Aroma is predominantly roasted peanut butter along with chocolate and coffee. Taste is combination of the aroma but the chocolate is the more dominant taste with the roasted peanut butter was close second. Mouthfeel was light, smooth & creamy. Exceptional stout."
3509,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.98,Just had the Keene Idea for the first time today.. Went to get Nelsons.. Now I want Keene Idea.. The same Nelson Hops used here. Little more Boozy than the Nelson but still so so drinkable and absolutely my new best from Alpine !
3510,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.74,2009 Sticker
3511,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.87,"Being new to Founders Brewing, I have found my two favorites in the past two weeks, this being one of them. For anybody that wants to develop their palate, CBS is the one to use."
3512,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.44,"I got this in a trade, and the date is smudged off :-(  Appearance: Poured 1/4th of a glass every time so not too much head. Pitch black of course. Some lacing.  Aroma: Impressive -- maple, coffee, and smoke all shine through.  Flavor: Overall sweet almost like a milk stout. Maple syrup throughout, strong coffee throughout as well. Milk chocolate. The barrels come through if you pay attention. There's a slight smokiness on the back end, which is such a great addition. There is absolutely no heat. The advertised flavors do not lie... however I don't get much more than that. Not a bad thing but perhaps was hoping for more.  Palate/Finish: Medium but oily and sticky. Very smooth, no carb. I do wish this was thicker, but I also realize that this is a porter so I won't knock it too much. Finishes with more coffee and sticky maple.  Overall: This is a very good beer and it deserves some accolade. I was hoping for something to 'chew' on, but at the same time, the style *is* porter, and I do admire that. The alcohol is completely hidden, and the maple/coffee flavors shine so well in the flavor and in the aroma. This is what impressed me most. On the other hand, it's not the most complex imperial porter I've had, and it's a little lactos-y. Overall, I'm gonna say this is an A beer, but not an A+."
3513,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.25,"Thanks to Heisenbrew for this 750ML bottle, which I am taking solo tonight. If you don’t hear from me by Sunday night, please send someone out to check my dead body’s blood sugar level.  Ever go blind? That’s how dark the beer is, with nearly no visible carbonation. The nose is barrel aged brownie whipped up with bitter cocoa. I’d eat that.  Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake – Barrel Aged was easily my favorite beer from Tampa Beer Week 2018, & the bottle doesn’t quite live up to my glowing memories. It is, of course, sweet enough that my vulnerability to type 2 diabetes just ticked upwards 5%. Straight corn syrup mixes with cane sugar & supremely bitter chocolate to form the base: the chocolate actually took a half hour to warm before the nasty edge wore off the bitter cocoa. Below the sweet upper crust is a healthy helping of bourbon, milky chocolate, long pull of vanilla, & cake batter. I don’t believe I typed that. Thick, full, coma-inducing. Pretty sure I’m not going to have any trouble finishing this off by myself. That said, I’m getting full.  Not as mid-blowing as fresh off the tap, but still an excellent beer…if you have a high tolerance for all things sugar."
3514,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip L: Clear golden copper pour. 1.5 fingers of foamy white head... falls fast, great rim of lacing. S: Tart and oaky... white wine and tannin, lightly fruity. T/F: Follows the nose. Pleasantly tart without being sour. Strong barrel character... somewhat dry and fruity. White wine... grape must... light peach. Very mild hop presence... all the flavors mingle together quite well. Brett is there but well incorporated. The finish is semi-dry and tart fruit. O: An awesome barrel-aged Saison, and a real treat. Very glad I got to try this one."
3515,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.4,"No bottling date visible; consumed on 5/2/20 Pours a slightly foggy golden straw body featuring a calm effervescence and topped with multiple fingers of tight, creamy, and soapy white foam; good head retention leaves a small layer of fluffy cap along with a persistent collar and comprehensive walling of moderate soapy lacing. Aroma offers a tight, spritzy yeast coursing with tempered lemony funk and a soft bubblegum/clove undertone to open; fresh apricot zest, touches of soft spice and honey, and sweet overripe peach flow into a maintaining clove background; horse blanket, minerality and fresh, herbal earth come to play steadily, integrating effortlessly into to the bouquet over time. Taste showcases a raw medley of stone fruit upfront, highlighting apricot and overripe peach guiding into zesty lemon peel as a creeping acidity encroaches across the profile with a minor funk/horse blanket interlude and bright, floral minerality lasting through the finish. Mouthfeel shows a light body with a well-attenuated and fluffy high carbonation easing to a blanket of gritty spritz across the mid-palate with a quaint, casual acidity/ tartness building; a background wetness persists on the back end before being overtaken by a taut, dry finish as a soft acidity lasts through the swallow. Simultaneously contemplative and casual, such clean refinement gives way to myriad accentuated detail honed with stunningly interwoven complexities along the profile and palate; a definitive example of the style, highlighting the brilliant levels of expression capable from an equally soft, elegant foundation."
3516,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.15,"Poured 22oz bottle into chalice. Vintage 2014. Color is molasses with a thin tan had that fades into a cap and only leaves behind a few spots of lacing. A sweet scent of bourbon, brown sugar, dark fruit, and some charred oak. Some peat and burnt caramel notes, very inviting.Flavor is sweeter with some dark fruit and peat malts. The bourbon, vanilla, burnt caramel, toffee, and charred oak add to the flavor depth in this. Finishes slightly tart with dark cherry. Feel is heavy and smooth. Another very well made BB BW."
3517,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.52,"Pours a half clear orange color with a medium bodied off white colored head that laces the glass a lot as it fades. The smell is of sweet toasted malts and mix of floral and piney hops. The taste is slightly sweet up front with a mix of floral, some piney, and a hint of citrusy hops. Less of a palate smasher than expected. Medium bodied, lighter feeling than it looks, perfect amount of carbonation. Excellent Pale ale, almost to the IPA side but really well done."
3518,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.5,"Just realized I didn't check this one in on 2/19, reviewed from notes."
3519,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.78,My scores just tell it all. Freekin amazing taste and look and feel good things for my taste buds. If you don’t think this beer is superior it is my humble feeling that you haven’t got a clue about finely crafted IPA’s. New England or otherwise.
3520,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.71,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like sweet dark maple, pepper spice, cinnamon sticks, chocolate fudge, oak, and light bourbon. The maple is super strong here, even without a ""direct"" addition of - these must have been wet barrels. There's a touch of the underlying bourbon, and some nice oakiness, too. The pepper does a lot of work here, adding a tingly spiciness that helps balance out the heavy maple sweetness here. The cinnamon adds a sticky candy sweetness, too. I don't get much of the vanilla of the base beer, but there's a lot of silky chocolate character here. Even though it's sweet, there's enough spiciness to keep it drinkable and not taxing. This is medium bodied, silky and creamy, with a appropriate level of carbonation for the style. It's surprisingly drinkable, as there's no booziness at all. This is truly quite excellent - it's decadent, and much, much better than the base Mexican Cake."
3521,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.38,"2019 bottle into a Hair of the Dog tasting glass.  Muddy water, minimal carb but smells and tastes much better than the appearance. Figs, dark fruit, caramel. Smoke and bourbon barrel. Vanilla. A bit hot but pleasantly so. Thin for style. Overall very enjoyable."
3522,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.4,375 'll bottle
3523,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.45,"750ml bottle. Poured out a reddish-amber color with a small, khaki-colored head of foam. It smelled of cherry, other berries and toffee. Tart berry taste with oak, toffee and hints of vanilla."
3524,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.75,"How does a Farmhouse Ale get any better than this. Beautiful brilliant golden color with a foamy fluffy sticky head that lasts and sticks to the glass with a dense honeycomb lacing. The wine and oak tones are well balanced with the base ale. Wonderful nose, smooth mouth feel, must try!"
3525,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,3.88,"Lifted this 22 oz. bottle from a beer museum in River Falls, WI, & I’m sure it has no idea how it got there. Split with my wife.  Black. Nose much milder than expected, a bit of roast & sweetness, little else.  Caffe’ Americano is a boozy punch to the forebrain. More balanced than most CC stouts, this has equal portions of vanilla, roast, espresso, sweetness, all with a sturdy shot of alcohol & a finish of light chocolate. Big, brawny. No problem at all to put away half of this bottle.  Not quite up to the Valhalla-high standards of CC, but this is a stout that I would never be unhappy to find in a glass, or doing keg stands with. Very good beer."
3526,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.43,"Got a from my man Nick, thanks again! Medium black body with a finger or so of tan foam. The smell is laced with full and wonderful coconut with coffee, dark chocolate and a kiss of toffee to boot. Taste has the coconut and coffee meld together beautifully, lush dark chocolate, toffee, and a touch of roasted malts underneath. The body is velvet smooth, so lush and creamy, yet doesn't get stout heavy, a wonderful porter mouthfeel. Just a simply wonderfully made beer"
3527,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.3,"375 ml corked bottle. Large head, disappears rapidly. Deep golden colour, cloudy when the yeast is poured. Heavenly aroma of barnyard and ensilage with white wine vinegar elements. Flavour is crisp and very dry, reminiscent of a very dry white wine or brut champagne. Not as complex as I expected. Really a beer for the ""Champagne Brut"" people."
3528,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.5,Solid beer. Good tartness but not too sweet. Very balanced and a mega solid brew. Number one solid in the world and we’ll worth the $45 to buy one at the brewery.
3529,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.3,"Got a bottle of this in July of 2017 when my best friend Jon and I visited the brewery when I went to visit him in northern California where he lives. This particular bottle was bottled on 2/15/17. Been holding onto this until tonight. Decided tonight is the night to finally drink this one. Poured out the bottle I just uncorked into my tulip glass, this beer pours a fairly cloudy/hazy light golden color with a good amount of little bubbles rising to the beer's surface. Has a nice white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass. Not much lacing here though. Aromas of some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit. The taste follows suit, with some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit and some green apple tartness. A very nice flavor profile overall indeed. Has a fairly crisp and slightly prickly, yet also smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a nice sour and slightly dry aftertaste. Very easy to drink in teh way well crafted beer ought to be. Eric"
3530,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.5,"Reddish pour. Tastes of raspberry. Very tough to get this beer in the USA. Beer is quite tart compared to other offering from Cantillion. Still solid, and highly recommend."
3531,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.57,"Pours dark brown with reddish hue and one finger head. Aroma is cherries, blackberries, some chocolate, vinegar, and oak. Taste is an explosion of dark berries and cherry skins. Tastes super tart and acidic like cherry and BlackBerry skins. Chocolate isn't prominent but adds complexity. I get hints of citrus and vanilla as it warms. Mouth feel is medium to full. Tart berries dominate here. The oak provides character and and dry finish. Unique and complex beer."
3532,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.61,Look: Pink/red Clear with small white head that recedes immediately. Has medium carbonation.
3533,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.22,"Bought on a recommendation at Blackbeard's Crafts on Sawtelle, this one surprised me. Everything in it is subservient to the cacao-- the vanilla stands in for sugar, the coffee offers bitterness where the malty stout would itself refuse to. It does really remind you of a milkshake, but not quite because of any desserty cloying sweetness. It's the viscosity, the half-and-half mouthfeel that delivers the vanilla and cacao while somehow sneaking in a full 12 or 13 percent ABV when you can barely even register the burn. Mine poured into a snifter with no head and barely even the sound of fizziness, and on the nose it's pure dessert-- chocolate milk or devil's food cake. I try not to inhale too much as I drink it, because I want to catch the ancho chili and the beer in a way that the aroma doesn't carry. Usually, this is not my kind of thing-- I don't like foreign flavors as a dominant element, and I like for a fine food to carry more layers, or maybe more variance between its layers. ""Bomb!"", instead, wields its complexity in a way that focuses your attention onto that single 65-percent-cacao sensory simulacrum, making you wonder how this is even beer.  I wanted to finish by saying that I respect this beer but didn't plan to buy another. Unfortunately for me, this beer feels like a perfect match for some of my favorite domestic blue cheeses. Rogue Creamery's exquisite ""Caveman Blue"" sings in the same key as this stout, and I have no choice but to try them together."
3534,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,3.96,"Classic, oldschool porter - quite hoppy, very roasty, lots of bitter, dark chocolate. It's not tremendously thick, but you don't expect that from a porter."
3535,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.63,"On draft at Great Notion. Deep dark brown with a lacey ring of foam around the edge of glass. Aromas had some maple and coffee, with chocolate and roasted malts. But the depth of flavor was not there, and certainly not to the level of something like Mornin' Delight. The maple seems artificial. Perhaps the thing that really didn't live up to expectation was the feel. Much lighter than expected"
3536,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.64,"Bottle. Dark brown/black pour with a chocolate head and an oily sheen. . Crazy fudge and chocolate nose. Wow, that’s legit. Bitter dark chocolate, caramels, dark roasted malts, mellow rye whiskey, oak, and vanilla notes. Complex, with a wonderful mouthfeel. Nice balance of sweet and bitter roasted malts. Good body."
3537,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.27,"L: cloudy yellow, quickly dissipating head, some lacing"
3538,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.56,Great spicy brew. Good mixture of barrel and heat. Thought this was one of the best BA spiced beers I've ever had up there with BA cake and BA oro negro. Really impressed how bottle logic's descriptions are always on point.
3539,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.52,"2014 Vintage. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Drie Fonteinen tumbler glass. Thanks Emily for getting this for my birthday! Pours a deep orange, lightly hazy body with a big, frothy off-white head with a yellow ring around the head that sticks around for a while.  Aromas are funky and musty, with oak and damp cellar, lemongrass and hay, citrus, lightly grassy and a tad skunky. On the tongue it's lightly tart with barnyard funk but not overly funk, oak and citrus, yeasty, a little bitterness on the follow through, drying aftertaste. Lightly carbonated but super easy to drink, medium-light body.  This was fantastic - complex and balanced, so flavorful. 4 years did it well!"
3540,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.86,"This is the best Saison I've ever had. Pours golden with a white head. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Tastes a bit like cider with hay, farmhouse, and citrus."
3541,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.92,"To start I would like to say this was purchased on tap at a local bottle shop doing pours and crowlers. I may change this after I open the crowler, but this review is based solely off the 10 oz. pour I had at the release. With that being said it was quite cold off the initial pour.  Look- Poured thick jet oily black. The beer itself has zero light coming though the body, a slight amount on the top outer edge. The head is a very dark mocha brown with medium sized bubbles. The head hangs around for a good 4-8 minutes. The glass lacing is amazing, Thick lines of dark brown bubbles hang around on the glass.  Smell- The aroma is fresh boiled maple syrup. That high sugar fresh maple syrup that. Slowly as this beer warmed in the glass it explodes with notes of coffee. The syrup is kind of overwhelmingly there throughout the beer. The sweetness is so sugar like I cant really say it vanilla. As the beer rises in temperature though the heavy sent of fresh ground espresso comes through nicely. Taste- The Flavor profile is where this beer shined for me. Up front big espresso notes. A very nice bitterness, followed by an amazing sweetness. The back end of my pallet picked up ever possible maple flavor possible. Maple candy, and homemade fresh maple syrup. It is a very sweet beer. In all honesty though i really enjoy how the coffee notes mellow that out. The finish of beer you a greeted with a nice touch of vanilla.  Feel- the first sip this beer was not as thick as expected. It was poured quite cold as it warmed and I sipped on it, it became what seemed thicker. I mean this is a thick beer do not misunderstand what I am saying. But I just expected it to be thicker. Maybe out of a bottle it is.  Overall- Being 22 years old, I can say I've been super gifted with the beers I have been lucky enough to get my hands on. Since I got into craft beer early last year this has been in my top 10 wants for a while. I had a very high mental standard of how good this beer should be. It more than lived up to the hype. I was very lucky in being able to try this beer on tap. It really is all the best parts of breakfast in a bottle. This is a God tier beer for me. Absolutely outstanding."
3542,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.6,"2017 vintage poured from a 500mL bottle into a snifter. pours a shiny black with a tiny bit of mocha brown head. aromas of strong oak bourbon barrel, spicy rye, sweet sugars and a hint of dark fruits. taste has a much more pronounced chocolate flavor to it in addition to the strong barrel character and spiciness. superb mouthfeel as BL goes. definitely better than the majority of their stouts. this is an old school unrelenting in your face BA stout but it’s well done and damn tasty. it’ll kick your ass too if you’re not careful. i dig it."
3543,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.05,"Christmas tasting, lineup of all variants. Base beer comes off as very similar to the Woodford, a bit more fruity perhaps. Plums, raisins. Sweet and boozy."
3544,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.43,"2013 bottle from The Sovereign in DC. Pours a reddish golden hue, minimal head. Nice funk on the nose. It's a delicately composed blend of funk, apple, and grape skins. It's well rounded, not too acidic. A beautiful beer worth of its name."
3545,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.09,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing. This smells like heavy roast, pepper spice, rum spice, cocoa powder, oak, dark fruit, smoke, and espresso. Both barrels don't necessarily come through here - it's more smokey rum than anything else. I'm not sure I actually get any apple brandy. There's a decent amount of pepper, and a touch of cinnamon, and a definite big helping of chocolate. There's some tobacco and smoke too, as is kind of common with this brewery. There's a touch of molasses syrup on the back end, too. This is medium bodied, with a decent creaminess, and no real booziness, with a slightly bitter/syrupy finish. This isn't anywhere near the height of the hype it (used to) get, but it's still enjoyable in a vacuum."
3546,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.54,"2012 bottle poured into a stemmed tulip. Beautiful looking beer. Deep burgundy in color. Pinkish white head that dissipates quick. Aromas of raspberry and funk. Some earthiness in there. Flavor is tart raspberries and funk. More tart than I thought it’d be. Feelnis as you’d expect for this style. Overall, another outstanding Cantillon beer."
3547,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.16,"The beer pours a hazy golden yellow. The taste is pineapple upside down cake, navel orange, mango, & a mild vegetal note. It's a good beer but a little overrated I would say. Cheers! A-"
3548,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.72,"The beer pours a lightly foamy and white head that takes a bit to dissipate but seems carbonated enough that the glass I poured it in is creating a constant flow of carbonation to the top; keeping the surface covered with a nice looking foamy head. The beer itself is a clear solid medium gold color with a nice metallic appearance to it. I have ever rarely seen a more gorgeous beer every poured. The smell is pretty good. It starts with an herbal and orange rind and slowly reveals a slightly vinegar note at the end. The taste is absolutely fantastic. The notes are not overpowering but not hidden either. Rather, they come out fairly balanced with varying degrees of subtlety. It has a decent funk note with a hint of vinegar and bitter herbal orange rind with a slightly wood finish. The feel is divine. It is only slightly acidic but is not such that it is overwhelming. It has a very smooth feel with a good body to it; it is neither thin nor thick but directly in between. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Cantillon earns its reputation as very good brewery and this beer is perfect for hotter days during the summer or early Fall when things are getting cold but it's still hot."
3549,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.54,"Big thanks to Josh(jbuddle) for opening this. A- reddish pink with a beautiful haze and a soft pillow of white, cloud like head. N- sour cherry, oak, funky sourness T- a depth of cherry flavor, both sweet and sour cherry. great oakiness is coming through from sip to finish. sour fruit with a suttle sweetness. mmm this is good. M- light spritzy carbonation, smooth dry finish O- this one gets best in style IMO. by far the best kriek i have had."
3550,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.38,"Everything great in an imperial stout, deep brown to black, creamy tan foam. And a subtle hint of spices and chili peppers. A great example of how to add a lot of flavor and spice to a beer and not ruin it."
3551,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.59,"Appearance - Pours thick black with decent tan head that settles to a thick ring. Spotty lacing around the glass. Aroma - Huge barrel aroma, peppers come out nicely, the maple is a little subdued but there, big chocolate, cinnamon and bourbon aroma. A very in your face aroma everything is bog except the maple. Taste - Wow the maple sweetness is much stronger on several levels. The maple comes in first along with a rich chocolate cupcake flavor then transitions into a nice pepper burn. The maple comes back in the end once the heat settles a bit. The barrel is there but not as strong as the nose.  Feel - Heavy thick creamy feel, nice heat from the peppers just right. Nice dry finish. Overall - Really well done stout everything comes together so well."
3552,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.8,"Had this multiple times. Reviewing the most recent one I've had @ Toronado SD (not available anymore though :/) Thankfully this, bottle was not a gusher. Nice pop to the cork though. Served in a wine tulip. The bottle was chilled down considerably and had not been moved around much at all.  The carbonation was generous, but not overly so. It definitely subdued after sitting in the glass a bit. The smell is of tart cherries, slight amount of funky earthy/barnyard to it. The beer itself tastes very fruity, more sour than I remember it in past bottles, and resembles more like a great american wild than the tart cherry soda it could have passed for a year ago.  Mouthfeel is excellent, lightly mouthpuckering with the the carbonation makes it quite refreshing. I never get sick of this beer (probably responsible for at least half a case of it purchased onsite for consumption). Overall, I've noticed that the bottles at Toronado that had sat in their keg room undisturbed for a year have all turned out quite wonderful. I haven't seen a Cable Car Kriek gusher since the release day back in August last year. Not that it matters anymore, but if anyone has bottles floating around in their cellars, I'd probably leave it undisturbed for a while before opening to make sure you don't lose any of this awesome sour!"
3553,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.37,"Another unique and wonderful brew from HOTD. I’d call it somewhere between an American Strong and an Old Ale, but that doesn’t matter because it’s just delicious. After a couple years in my cellar the carbonation has suffered a bit, but many of HOTD’s offerings start out that way, so it doesn’t seem a problem. Nose and taste are both truly world class, so complex and so well integrated that I can’t begin to describe them - you just have to be here!"
3554,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.5,2016 batch drank in a teku on 10/5/2016 A nice refreshing crisp sour/gueuze. Certainly one of the better gueuze that I have had. Lemony tartness is present and balanced. Not too tart. The red wine barrels definitely are prevalent with a little boozy and nice oaky presence. Glad I can finally cross this one off the list! Very tasty and worth pursuing
3555,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.57,One of the 14 beers we have had in one session of some bad-ass tasting brew.
3556,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.11,"From a can, direct from the brewery. First impression was “this is no single ipa”. Tastes heavy to me, lush and potent. Bitter orange rind notes are most noticeable. good amount of bitter lingering... more than I expected. Finishes drier than I expected. There is a strong mineral character, an almost metallic tingle which, for me, takes over too much of the flavor. Here i was thinking this was a juicy neipa but Citra commonalities aside, this is a different animal. Im hoping it grows on me but it feels a bit “one note”. Im not blown away. Im maybe not as “citra-centric” as others so I shouldn’t be surprised that im not gaga over this. I see why people like it but... seems like a lot of hype surrounding this beer. My issue is that it starts exactly where it ends, it feels almost stingingly sharp with citrus... like your tongue is being zapped, but there isnt a depth to the experience... or a nuance to the hop profile... Again, one note. I normally really like single hop ipas but i think ive learned that citra does not have what im looking for, at least not when all by itself. All that said, it is excellent beer."
3557,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,3.97,"Thanks, to either Sam or Brian for this one. September 2018 release, 6.5% A clear light orange with a dense, white head with good retention and lacing, this looks solid. The nose is quite exciting. The combination of cognac and peaches is inspired and genuinely works. The star of the show, however, are the peaches. Bright, ripe juicy as well as sour, semi-ripe peaches are present, fleshy, pulpy, juicy. A touch of vanilla as well. The palate opens with a bright and explosive peach character but unfortunately carried on a base beer that's pretty intensely sour. Strong lactic acid sourness with preserved lemons and a lemonade are present. A large peach note, a blend of ripe, juicy peaches and semi-raw, mildly tannic ones, are is present up front. Notes of cognac are present on the mid-palate and are mostly hidden by the peach and the lactic notes. Medium-light in body and softly carbonated and drying and sour on the finish with a blend of peach and lactic sourness with a little cognac. I am surprised by how sour this is, it reminds me of a 6 year old Fou'foune instead of a fresh beer. The sourness does hamper the balance and drinkability some. Still, this is quite enjoyable."
3558,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.47,"Canned 8/10/21. Purchased 8/24/21 at Deerfield. L: Pours a dark and very hazy orange. Short, fluffy, creamy head with good retention around the glass. Beautiful lacing. S: Orange and mango aromas, with assorted ripe fruit. T: Citrus fruit up front, then it blends into more mango/tropical. Finishes with a surprisingly dry and slightly bitter bite. F: Somehow manages both a creamy and then prickly mouthfeel, one after the other. Remarkable. O: The complex mixture of flavors and mouthfeels makes this beer a classic."
3559,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.91,"Lucky enough to get a tip of when this was tapping at this year's Great Taste of the Midwest. Otherwise I probably would have missed it. Because with so many beers to try, I find it hard to keep track of when specific beers are being tapped. But I am very grateful that I was near the Perennial tent around 2:00 when they started pouring what turned out to be one of the best beers I have ever had. Regular Abraxas has always been one of my favorite beers. I was curious to see what barrel aging would do to adjuncts that are already in a fairly perfect balance. It was amazing how the barrel stood out but yet still allowed all of the other flavors to shine through. The beer almost tasted like a candy bar but was not overly sweet in anyway. The barrel muted the adjuncts slightly but if possible, put them into even more of a perfect balance than the regular version.  This year's Great Taste took place on a fairly hot day making barrel aged stouts a bit harder to drink. But this stood out by far and I easily would have downed another pour had it not been in such great demand."
3560,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.41,"Luxurious, oaken, bourbon-y, smooth, warm, silky, sweet and slightly bitter. What a gem of a barrel aged beer. All components march in lockstep, which the silkiness and balance of the beer being the two standout characteristics. Dark malts, bitter chocolate, oak, earth, fudge, licorice and a hint of leather. Complex, dark, deep, robust - all of these apply. Alcohol warmth without giving off any heat.  Thick but not viscus, substantial but not heavy - it's a sipper that won't occupy your palate for en entire evening."
3561,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.24,"L: Pours a light hazy golden color S: Very acidic you can smell the nectarines that are packed into this bottle. T: Very juicy but very sour. Big Nectarine and citrus notes F: Very light, very crisp with a dry finish O: This is a solid fruited sour. Love the look and the smell but just a bit to sour for me."
3562,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.43,"From a 16oz can marked BLONDE NO. 2 03/03/21 13:30 Pours into my tulip glass a well hazed amber with gold highlights and a moderate sized fluffy cream colored head. Rings of fluffly lace with some soapy streaks. Scent is peach, tropical fruits, citrus, pineapple, tangerine. Taste is tropical fruit, spice (white pepper), an oniony dankness (love that), citrus and grapefruit. Some pine resin in the background. Relatively low bitterness; it's there but it's soft. Mouth is creamy and soft; abv hidden well. This is a delicious DIPA. Love the combination of spicy/resiny/dank with tropical and citrus. Hits all my favorite notes."
3563,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.49,"A world-and-a-half of thanks to jrc1093 for this. What an absolute privilege, and I am eternally grateful for it. Thank you.  510ml bottle - dated 02/03/21 - poured into a Speigeleau IPA glass at fridge temp.  Pours a brilliant, unfiltered clarity honey golden blonde - impressively light for a triple IPA. The elixir is topped with a big, dense head of off-white foam, with pretty fair retention, eventually receding to a thick, bubbly collar, with some spotty lacing. Slow, but constant effervescence. Nose: That classic Pliny spirit is so evident. Beautifully composed malt, with some toasty caramel, sweet honey, and clean grain, with just a touch of fresh Italian bread. The hops are Pliny to a T - bursting with floral aromas of magnolia, lilac, and gardenia, lemon blossoms, and some sweet pine sap. There's some sweet fruity influence, with apricot jam, marmalade, and a thin thread of white grape, gooseberry, and fresh grass. A touch of grapefruit pith, and just a hint of that subtle boiled Simcoe dankness. Saturated and cohesive. Palate: Pliny The Younger greets the palate with a sweet malt foundation, with a nice grainy backbone. Some honey and fresh bread lay down a base for the swift flood of hops. Sweet, almost candied notes of grapefruit, tangerine, marmalade, and a touch of sweet white grape, while some brighter citrusy lemon and lime define the high end. In typical Pliny fashion, some floral, flowery hop notes emerge before an oily, resinous hop bite cuts in with bitter pine sap and pithy bite, quickly drying out the malt sweetness. The finish is resinous, moderately bitter, with potpourri, pith, and grains lingering. Mouthfeel/Body: For such a big, imposing imperial IPA, the beer drinks absolutely beautifully. Medium-bodied, with a soft, smooth malty backbone, and a bright, fluid crispness that allows it to remain exceptionally drinkable. Effervescence is soft, restrained, but ample and very present, providing just the right amount of lift and sparkle. Never cloying, and the hops dry it out beautifully, finishing with an oily, resinous, almost waxy cling that adheres to the palate, and let's those pithy notes really dig in. Overall: This is one of those larger-than-life beers, and it can often be difficult to maintain realistic expectations. All of Pliny The Elder's influence is here, and it's strong. It really is an amped up Pliny The Elder. Now, of course it isn't worth spending a fortune on secondary, or,investing your life in, but for a classic triple IPA, it's supremely drinkable, remarkably balanced, and 100% Pliny to its core. A little more docile than some might expect, but a truly delightful beer in every aspect."
3564,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.64,"04/2016 - This is delicious. It's got a nose that reminds me a traditional gueuze, which rocks for a U.S.-based brewery, plus it has fruity, vinous notes abound!"
3565,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.75,Very cloudy straw appearance with white head. Aroma is a nice grapefruit citrus with a hind of hops. Taste is a very pleasant grapefruit citrus with hops that has a slight bitterness
3566,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.73,"2010 vintage at Akkurat. Pours a clear golden orange with thick, soapy foam. Smell is very tart with notes of lemon, Seville oranges and grapefruit, covering a slight funkiness. Taste is amazing. Perfect. Superbly balanced acidity and sourness with huge notes of citrus and some funk and hay in the back. So deep and complex it's almost a shame to finish it. Mouthfeel is thin and effervescent. Overall, this is like the regular Gueuze on steroids. So deep and complex, but still not overwhelming. A masterpiece."
3567,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.7,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Westbrook tulip glass. Allowed to warm over an hour.  Pours an opaque black body with a one finger dark brown head that reduces slowly to a ring of foam and leaves no lacing. Aromas are sweet and inviting - vanilla-bourbon and milk chocolate, rich maple syrup, bittersweet cocoa. Habanero peppers in the background.  On the tongue the habanero shows up MUCH more - in an incredibly balanced, sweet and spicy cocktail of rich fudge brownies drizzled with maple-bourbon frosting, melding perfectly a cinnamon-caramel-bittersweet chocolate follow through, lending way to more habanero and sweet maple on the finish. Light spicy burn on the finish but nothing overwhelming. I can taste every adjunct in this beer and they're all perfectly balanced.  Body is rich, mouthfeel is spot on, not too thick but perfectly silky and medium-low carbonation.  This was one of the best beers I've had in 2019 thus far - it takes the base beer and adds a maple-bourbon dimension to add complexity without overtaking the base flavors. This one hits all the check boxes for a world class beers!"
3568,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,3.91,"Dark black pour, lacing for days.  Cherry and birch bark on the nose. Smells more like a quad.  The awesome texture on the front of the tongue is quickly assaulted by liquorice, anaise, and anything else you might taste after opening up a package of black Twizlers candy. "
3569,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.88,Anytime I get a chance to buy hopslam I immediately stock up on it. The high alcohol taste is masked by the smooth bitterness. The taste isn't completely overwhelming and goes down smooth.
3570,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.36,"Massive thanks to Kevin for sharing this beast. A- Pitch black 750ml pour to a few becher around the Thanksgiving table. A thick and foamy deep tan cap up to a finger before it slowly falls to a medium belt at the edges. Small sheets of lace wrap down the glass. S- A bold aroma of... Affogato. The rich dark and milk chocolate aromas follow up very strong espresso, vanilla, caramel sweets, roast barley, cocoa powder and chocolate milk. Really on point for affogato or ice cream sundae. T- The espresso and roast grains pick up compared to the aroma and it really helps bring things together in harmony. Medium-dark roast coffee, milk chocolate, dark cocoa powder, chocolate milk, hot fudge sundae lead to vanilla beans, espresso, lactose sweets, caramel, general desserts and all things cocoa. A dessert beer for sure. MF- Thick and massive body with a slick and syrupy texture. Medium-low level of carbonation and an oily feel. Ends a bit warm but this beer doesnt feel within miles of its ABV. Affogato hot fudge sundae beer. Starts out amazing but the sweetness is eventually just a bit over the top to the point where a 1/3ish pour of the bottle was beyond enough."
3571,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.58,"L - Snifter pour from draft. Inky black. Thin head. S - absurd amounts of bourbon and dark fruit. Vanille. Creme brulee. Carmelized sugar. T - sticky sweet. Loads of vanilla toffee and burnt sugat. Faint char. F - very, very hot. Spicy alcohol heat and a sticky coating. O - overall stellar"
3572,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.43,"2015 Vintage, poured into a taster. Highly superior to regular Dark Lord, as the sweetness is mellowed out by the barrel characteristics. Still on the sweet side, and a bit hot, but an enjoyable offering."
3573,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.21,"Bright hazy yellow beer with low white bubbles. Smell of white wine grapes and some lemon acid. Taste betrays the 7.5% abv. It is light and tart and delicate with just a bit of bread to balance out the citrus. An undertone of saturated wet oak fills in where the malt usually is balancing the tartness of limes, lemons, white pear and of course sour white wine grapes. Balance is impecable; beer went down disappointingly fast. Finishes dry and salty. Overall very delicious, but not going to come back too soon considering the 15 dollar price point."
3574,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.22,"12 oz. bottle poured into sinfter. 2017 vintage. Pours near black with a thin beige lacing. Nose: First impression reminds me a lot of Expedition stout. Big dark chocolate and roast character. The barrel comes through subtly with some caramel, vanilla, and oak character. Taste: Chocolate and roast up front followed by the bourbon barrel. Very balanced flavor profile. I like the added dimension the barrel brings but the base beer is coming off like a slightly watered down Expedition to me. As someone who loves Expedition stout I can't help but wish I was drinking straight BBA Expedition instead of the blend. Still a great beer without a doubt. Feel: Very smooth. Body is noticeably lighter than Expedition stout."
3575,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.41,"The can pour is a densely cloudy crayon yellow. The effervescent cap is very fine. The aroma is strong with pineapple, strawberry and mango. Mango, orange and some grapefruit are large in the flavor. There is significant hop burn, but this is okay. The mouthfeel is very smooth nonetheless. This is a superb NEIPA."
3576,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.16,"Thanks to Augzilla for sharing this one at Oneinchaway's tasting. Pours a murky golden-yellow with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour with grain, wine grape, white wine, wood, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, fruit, white wine, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great white wine barrel aged characteristics all around. Serving type: bottle."
3577,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.33,Canned on 1/22. Poured to Birrateque IPA 18OZ Glass on 1/25.
3578,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.43,"2019 Handjee, poured from cellar temp into a plastic glass. Shared with friends spread out in my backyard The base beer is big and fudgy, decent amount of oak/barrel to reign it in. Getting a touch of soy sauce like oxidation though which distracts from what I think this beer is going for."
3579,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.24,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy goldenstraw with a one finger head; a few shards of lacing Smell: Papaya, melon and peach aroma Taste: Papaya and melon forward with just a hint of peach and blueberry; low bitterness, through the middle with the fruit flavors dominating the finish Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation Overall: I can't say that I was stunned by this beer as the ratings would suggest; the can was fresh so perhaps the batch was off but the flavors seemed somewhat muted compared to other Tree House beers I have tasted; very good but not great"
3580,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.69,What can I say for a beer I've been a fan of for ages. I can buy a four of FBS for less than 9 bucks. I used to seek out this beer when it was hard to find and paid $15 a 4 pack back then. If you're a fan you know what the beer taste like. Say no more. This beer speaks for itself in its own category. It's always delicious.
3581,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.85,"What an incredible treat, thanks to a very generous friend and BA! Was nervous opening such a rare bottle and the wax hardened into almost brittle plastic. Poured rather thick. Vanilla hits you like a truck on the nose. Tasted like lightly sweet vanilla ice cream with chocolate. Had it side by side with a '14 Assassin and an SR71, but all 3 were very different even though the base is the same."
3582,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,3.43,"A big-bodied dark brew pour. Smells of all the chocolate, molasses, toffee, and roast you would expect, but taste mellow as if I overaged it (in under a year). I will drink fresh next time."
3583,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.45,375mL 2017 edition poured into a snifter
3584,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.44,"Canned 9/29/20 A big warm welcome to 3 Floyds, who are finally distributing to Massachusetts. Probably the only good thing to come out of this entire year. Currently the 135th highest rated beer on this site, I'm excited to try this on. I also figured it's the perfect occasion to finally check out Pig Destroyer. Side note, this label art is fucking sick Pours a lightly cloudy amber gold with 3 billowing fingers of soapy off white that slowly fades to a thick cap and leaves tons of lacing in its wake A surprisingly well balanced aroma here given the abv. Notes of grapefruit pith, orange, soft bread, pine, and caramel malts. Very simple, but very enticing Starting things off, there is a wonderful hop profile bringing notes of weed and juicy grapefruit backed up by hefty malt. The swallow brings a flash of intense resiny hops before settling down with a more pronounced sweet caramel malt and grain, closing out with moderate hop bitterness This does not drink like 10.5% at all (although it can certainly be felt). A medium body combines with prickly carbonation, resulting in a shockingly smooth beer. The finish is superbly dry and balanced Oh yeah, this is the shit. I completely understand the hype behind these guys. Currently, I only have Barbarian Haze from them in the fridge ready to try, but I can't wait to work my way though their lineup. Cheers!"
3585,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.56,"Pours a 1/4” head and lacy suds on top of hazy yellow/orange body. Nice refreshing mouthfeel and the double dry hops comes through in the taste, and just a touch lingering afterwards. Tangerine, kumquat, pineapple, and sweet citrus aroma."
3586,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,5.0,"Bottled on 10.09.19 - Poured into a pint glass. Head quickly dissolved to a thin, persistent layer atop the black brew, leaving a thin lacing with just a bit of retention. Aroma is heavy with chocolate and bourbon, with notes of maple and malt behind it giving it a rich, complex character. Bourbon is the first thing that comes through in the taste, but the chocolate and maple notes interplay, with just the subtlest hint of the coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy, settling well on the palate to allow for an extended taste of each sip as the flavors dance in the mouth, with the warmth from the high ABV complementing the flavors perfectly - it's not too heavily carbonated either, which is great, since this is one you'll want to savor each sip of. I'd describe the overall feel as silky and luxuriant. This is the pinnacle of what stouts can aspire to be - I've never given a perfect score before, but I can't find any faults in this incredible brew from Founders."
3587,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.66,L- Hazy orange with frothy white head
3588,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.31,"A - Very hazy golden orange color with a vibrant white head. S - Orange, mango, and citrus. T - Orange, mango, citrus, and resiny pine. There's a little bit of fruity pithiness. Finishes with a nice citrus and pine bitterness. M - Big medium body with a nice soft texture ture. O - Rock solid for sure and worth a try."
3589,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.57,Look (4.75): nice frothy one finger head. leaves lacing. Super hazy yellow
3590,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,3.52,"750 mL bottle. Pours inky and viscous black with floaty coconut bits. Smells of strong coconut and fudge. Tastes of coconut, chocolate, hefty roasted malt. Gets a little soy saucy. Very heavy, but not excessively sweet. It smells great and tastes great up front, but too much soy sauce."
3591,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.57,"L: A hazy pale yellow with a creamy white head on top. Good lacing. S: Bright citrus zest, passion fruit, mango, and pine with a stonefruit character from the yeast. T: Moderate bitterness up front, moves into huge citrus and tropical fruit flavors of grapefruit, mango, passionfruit, and peach. The malt is more in the background but provides a nice breadiness. F: Dry, crisp despite the low carb. Near perfection. Overall: A delicous and well balanced NEIPA. Galaxy and Citra hops seem to pair very well together. I would recommend this beer to anyone that loves a tropical fruit dominant hop character."
3592,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.4,"As Tree House indicates, Doppelgänger is an imperial version of Alter Ego - which I think of is a cousin to their flagship beer, Julius. So, you could think of Doppelgänger as a second cousin to Julius. "
3593,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.5,A friend in Hoarders shared this with us. This was super smooth for the ABV. I have had the regular version of this also. I found this just as good if not better.
3594,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.63,"Cellar bottle and have had fresh. Had been trying to find a bottle for many years, and the hunt was worth it! First a warning, this beer is dangerous, it tastes so light and peachy, along with signature saison yeast character, that the 10 percent abv is undetectable! So smooth yet has a strong saison presence in the mouthfeel. Bit of an aftertaste of multivitamin with the peach but not in a bad way. Very balanced, would be the perfect beer for a sunny picnic in July."
3595,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.65,A 2018 Vintage 12 ounce bottle poured into a goblet. Had no head but the rich color is brewed tea like although it has a rich aroma of sweetness. Molasses and brown sugar is typical for the style. The taste is of molasses and brown sugar sweet. The mouthfeel is medium to thin and a real sweet pleasure on the tongue. Overall another fantastic brew from Firestone Walker Brewing and a great Quadrupel. The pleasure was all mine. BEER BEFORE GLORY!
3596,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.43,"From a 16oz can dated 11/10/20 into a pint glass. Message on can: R.I.P. A Pours an opaque yellowish orange with about a finger and half of frothy white head that lingers forever and leaves incredible lacing. Smells of peaches, nectarine, orange, grapefruit and a bit of pineapple.  Taste follows-very juicy with a moderate amount of piney/earthy bitterness on the back end of the sip. Maybe just a hint of alcohol in there as well. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth-unbelievably drinkable for 8.2% abv. Mild bitter aftertaste. Low carbonation. Overall, another top notch beer from Tree House. Although I enjoy some of their other offerings a little more than this, I'm not turning my nose up at it."
3597,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.56,"My first Trillium in quite awhile, so I am really excited for it. It's hazy and looks like any other hazy IPA. Some others are brighter and more Instagramable I suppose though. As with the best IPAs, I'm loving the balance here between sweetness and malt. It has a nice dry finish with bitter tart fruit. It's not overly juicy, but I'm assuming that's not the goal here either. A great beer! I wish I could share it if I weren't under a sheltering decree by our governor!"
3598,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.45,Look: Semi-vigorous pour yields a 3/4 inch mocha-colored head.
3599,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.88,"Bottled march 20, 2019"
3600,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.03,Bottle. Poured inky black. Minimal head. I (as I believe most) love and have loved this label for years. Finally got around to trying it. Honestly I thought it was lacking in barrel character. The other flavors and aromas were tasty but I think it needed more barrel. Still good. I actually believe I had the Port version a few years ago and remember liking that one more than this.
3601,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,3.78,"Yeah, this is old as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/4/17 and yes, I have a ton of beer to get through here at my house. With that being said, I wasn't sure why this was rated so high. Maybe it's the name on the label or the nature of the hopping but overall, this was an average beer that didn't stand out in any particular way to me, even if there was hardly any sediment from it being in my basement for all this time... Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a deep apricot with enough fluffy head to top it off. Quite cloudy, only a bit of sediment floated in it and hardly any light got in around the edges. Very little soapy lacing was seen along the back of my pint glass as I worked my way through this, which was a bit of a surprise. Loads of Mosaic, dankness, grass, and forest in the muted nose as they all came through in the taste. Nothing heavy here and the Barley stood out more than anything else in the taste, as this felt quite full but uninspiring at the same time. A lack of easily discernible bitterness stood out to me as this went right down and although it wasn't bad, it needed quite a bit more to stand out from Trillium's other offerings that I've had. Not a lot of booze here either as this was the epitome of what a generic American Pale Ale is, in my eyes. I need to get a fresh can of this but given how well their other offerings have held up well over time, this one was a bit of a letdown. I prefer the regular Fort Point and know that it's me, and not them, when it comes to how low I rated this. Needs another go before I fully write it off!"
3602,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.67,Very cloudy straw color with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a grapefruit and other citrus without any hoppyness. Taste is a Devine grapefruit that is very smooth and no hops at all.
3603,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.75,"insanely tart and funky, bright acidity, lemon, white grape, ripe ripe berry quality, hay, oak, barnyard character, spicy pepper note, just really complex funky sour qualities. its aggressive but so perfectly executed."
3604,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.55,Look - just fantastic thick black with a lasting thick tan head 
3605,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.67,"Pours a jet black with very little head. Mostly just tan bubbles. Smell and taste is a wonderful blend of molasses, vanilla, and some spice you get from the bourbon barrels. Mouthfeel is medium and one of the easiest stouts I’ve ever had to drink. Overall, many barrel aged beers are too boozy this one is perfect in blend."
3606,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.15,"Poured into a snifter. Opaque dark chocolate color with a thin tan head. Aroma was chocolate with roasted grain and coffee. Taste was chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and vanilla. Excellent beer."
3607,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.6,"Well executed combination of maple and bourbon barrels... both are very prominently displayed without overpowering the other. Maple is a more subtle/natural component, and not an overly-sweet/ artificial flavor.  Really easy to drink with medium body."
3608,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.13,"Brown and dark amber pour, ultra thin lighter brown head. Aroma knocks substantial whiskey and brown malt notes all over it. Its boozy. But it blends well with the rest of the brown malt, brown sugar, maris otter and said booziness.  Taste is a sipping experience. Nuts, caramel and toffee all over it. A hint of raisin. I wouldn't say this hid the alcohol, that is pretty much impossible at this abv. But it does what it can. On the back end of the mouthfeel you can pull mild black and tan tobacco notes. Also has a substantial amount of viscosity for a barleywine. It also is on the high end of the spectrum when it comes to stickiness as well. A touch of earth to round it out. While its a very enjoyable beer, I dunno, would just as much if not more prefer something a little easier going like CW or BCS barleywine. This one might be just a tad too big for my ideal tastes."
3609,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.56,"A delicious beer indeed. Bright orange color pours with virtually no head, juicy fresh apricot and hay nose, bright stone fruit vinous juiciness with a funky tartness that just leans on the edge of sharpness. In a vacuum, this beer certainly stands on its own merits. However, I can't help but to weigh the vast difference in the cost of admission versus West Ashley/Fou as compared to the difference in quality, which is, in my humble opinion, marginal."
3610,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.94,"Tasted from bottle. Pours dark brown with thin beige head. Aroma of cognac, molasses, caramel. Thick, cloying, chewy mouthfeel. Moderate to heavily sweet. Flavors of brown sugar, molasses, cognac, toffee, caramel, and hints of oak. Just a perfect barleywine."
3611,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.9,"Purchased for $20 from a private collector. 3 year old 500 ml bottle from 2018 poured into a snifter. This is my first Bottle Logic brew, as I'm in Ohio so it's difficult to get California beer out here. Poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle, then disappeared completely. The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer."
3612,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.4,"I don’t love hazy IPAs, but I like this. Pours a cloudy orange, which is expected for the style. Interesting drinking experience. For 8.5%, really chuggable."
3613,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.17,"It’s good, there’s no doubt about it. I avoided trying the 2021 issue because of all the hype around it and the ridiculous price. At 15 dollars a six pack, I won’t be trying it again. It’s blended well, all the flavors come together nicely. The bitterness is there and satisfying. But, from one beer lover to the next, this is an overpriced hype machine. I’ve had dozens of DIPA, many of them were at least as good as this one. Buy it as a novelty, enjoy it because it’s good, and move on."
3614,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.36,"Picked up a 6 pack of this at the brewery today. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy golden orange hue with a thin one finger white head that leaves light lacing and fades to leave thin wisps. Wish the retention was better. S - Aromas of grassy fields, tangerine, little bit of almost tropical dankness. Nice white wine grape aroma that is unmistakably Nelson.  T - Taste is similar tot he nose, great grassy floral notes with waves of vinous Australian hops. Big slightly sweet white wine like flavours mixing with a slight dankness. There's a nice light grain component as well. As it warms that vinous flavour pops even more which is lovely. M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, little creamy, good body. Alcohol is hidden nicely.  O - Overall this was a very nice double ipa with great Nelson characteristics. Considering the ABV though I expected the retention to be much more than what it was and the nose was just a bit weaker than the taste. Still though it was quite enjoyable. Serving Type: Can"
3615,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.38,"12.7 oz bottle split with my wife. Pours a clear straw yellow with an off-white head that fades to a ring of bubbles. I saved the last ounce with yeast and added it to my glass after a while, which made the remaining beer quite cloudy. Aroma and flavor are funky/sour with oak, tannins, grape must, and hints of vanilla and grassiness. Complex but not quite my favorite sour/wild flavor profile. Overall it was tasty but not quite as amazing as I had hoped. At any rate, good to check off another beer style!"
3616,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.44,"Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip L: Caramel/mahogany brown pour. Massive foamy white head... lasts awhile with thick lacing around the glass. A bit of debris at the bottom of the pour. S: Rich and sweet. Toasted malts, dark fruit, and candy sugars. T.F: Dark fruit and sweets. Brown sugar, caramel, baked raisin, and fig. Plum and Belgian candy. Toasted malty goodness... some spice and a whiff of coffee. Smooth and creamy. Medium to heavy bodied... a bit of booze but well hidden. O: An elite Quad, and as usual those monks don't mess around. A 'must try' at some point in your beer drinking existence."
3617,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.5,"Pours black with a finger of motor oil and caramel colored head. It looks dense and sticky, clinging to the glass after each swirl. Aroma is rich caramel, toffee and dark chocolate with roasty coffee and roasty and toasty malts. Whiskey spices up the back end with a little chary bitterness to round it out. It smells dense and hearty. Flavor profile is toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate and roasty coffee with roasty, toasty, caramely malts. It's rich and dense, jam-packed with flavor. Bourbon adds a touch more depth and balance without adding much heat. Char closes it out, adding a little more bitterness. Mouth feel is dense, thick and chewy. Overall, dense and chewy stout jam packed with coffee and some bourbon. It's a boozy breakfast in a bottle. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle."
3618,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.96,"Absolutely spectacular in every way. Had a 375ml poured into a tulip glass. This is a beer I will remember for a long time, maybe even haunt my dreams. The flavor and intensity builds on your palette but doesn't leave an after taste. "
3619,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.73,This was incredibly delicious. I was hoping for something special as I was told it was great. But this blew me away. This was a phenomenal beer on a hot summer day. I hope I can find more...
3620,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.37,"Drank a bottle of this recently. Thick and viscous used motor oil pour that smelled of coconut, vanilla and marshmallow. Huge aroma on this. Taste was good with tons of coconut and vanilla but I also found it to be cloying. VERY sweet which really took away from the beer. Feel was great. Nice and viscous. Mouth coating. This beer hit some of the marks for me but really was just too sweet in the flavor department. Wish it were toned down a touch."
3621,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.81,"The nose on this was absolutely incredible. Huge punch in your face of raspberries, raspberries, and yup, more raspberries. Cold it was more raspberry juice, the saison side only really shined as it warmed up. I really think though that fruited wild ale, like Atrial, is better than fruited saison. Beautiful beer, but I still prefer Saison du Fermier over this."
3622,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,3.88,"Pours thick and milky and golden, just what you'd expect from a well-loved Trillium beer. Smell is grass, green onion, and maaaaaybe a liiiittle citrus? But not enough for my liking. Taste is equally bitterness-forward, and doesn't match the flavors my eyes were expecting. It's nice to be reminded NEIPAs aren't all pure juice, but it also reaffirms what I like in a beer. Great for what it is, and if you like that, you will love it, it's just... not for me."
3623,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.44,"Tart granny smith apple, lemon, yogurt, lime, white peach, white wine, minerals and oak. Very short, crisp, dry finish. Faint fennel note. Creamy mouthfeel. This is amazing."
3624,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.59,"16oz tall boy poured into farmstead stemmed bulb.  Canned 07/03/19. Appearance: Black body with dark brown head that pours several fingers tall with good head retention. Smell: tons of milk chocolate. Mellow & pleasant coffee. Mellow maple syrup.  Taste: perfectly balanced chocolate, coffee, & maple. Hint of lactose. As the beer warms, coffee becomes more bold.  Mouthfeel: medium body with low yet adequate carbonation. Silky smooth. No booze. Outstanding drinkability; I could drink two cans of this without palate fatigue or getting bored with the flavors here.  Overall: very well balanced adjunct milk stout. Dessert beer for sure. One of the best milk stouts that I have drank since Surly Four."
3625,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.22,"Bottled Sept 14 2018. Almost two years on this bad boy. Lets see what time has done him. Pours a dark brown. Motor oil looking, no light penetration. A finger of tightly packed bubbles. Nice smooth looking mocha head. Nose is oak and bourbon, hints of dark fruit, and maybe caramel or toffee? This has aromas more like a barleywine or a Belgian Dark rather than a stout. Not getting any coffee though unfortunately. Taste is oak barrel and bourbon right up front, which transitions briefly to coffee, then toffee/caramel and mild chocolate. So the main thing I'm noticing here is, this doesn't taste like a stout. Huge caramel notes. Bright, fruit flavors and hoo boy the sweetness. It would make a peach jealous. Like a natural cane sugar soda. But as quickly as it is there, it fades on the swallow. No stickiness, no cloying. Coffee is minimal, bitterness is minimal. Alcohol is present but not hot or overwhelming. This just tastes like a barrel aged Belgian. Mouthfeel is smooth with very mild carbonation. Easy drinking. Light. As i said before, not too sticky or cloying. Sweetness restrains itself a good degree. Overall, I think the amount of time has been too much for this one to bear. Maybe 1 year would have been fine but two has taken it's toll. An enjoyable brew. I would love to have it fresh to see what it's like, but this is a little past it's prime. Very mellow, subdued. Perhaps too much so. But that's what happens."

Hella robust tropical fruits on the nose and tongue; but all greeted by that oh-so-familiar dry, pithy aftertaste. Again, the last part is not for Raul, but he defends your right to love it. Cheers. *huge edit - damn, as this beer warms it grows on you. The flavor was always there, but the aftertaste is so lush and balanced. Hell yes, Trillium"

Nose is of citra - citrus with tropical fruit notes, cereal.  taste follows with fruit up front - peach, orange, tropical. minimal bitterness  feel is medium body with minimal carb.  overall - big fruit from start to finish. easy to drink, but do wish there was a little more carb and would like a lighter body."
3629,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.19,"Appearance: orange in color with a 1 "" head that slowly falls. Smell: citrus and a hint of peach comes through to the nose. Taste: caramel, grapefruit, orange, peach, and a hint of pine. Bitterness is moderate. Alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer. Lightly crisp throughout.  Overall: an easy to drink DIPA that is flavorful and satisfying."
3630,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.45,"Canned on 3/11/2021. Six days ago - what a score!!! Pours a super hazy dirty straw color with over a finger of head. The nose has notes of citrus, overrippened tropical fruits and a touch of darkness in the back end (is this what they meant by ""green?"") The flavor has really bold tropical fruits up front with a bitter and pithy finish.  The bitterness is apparent but NOT turned up to 11. Nevertheless, this is a modern day classic. Anyone who asks why Tree House beers are so special, this is the beer to hand them."
3631,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.56,"A. Cloudy golden orange in color. Thin ring of white foam and minimal lacing. S. Juicy apricots and some lactic acid on the nose. Not much funk here - just fruit. It smells really good  T. Tasty follows the nose; apricots and lactic acid. The first few sips were almost overwhelming with the amount of acidity / sour on my pallet. As it warmed the fruit came out more. The flavor lingers in your mouth for quite awhile after taking a sip. Not much funk or complexity - just sour and fruit F. Just the right amount of carbonation for the style. The finish is very dry and makes you thirsty for more. It really coats your mouth O. The warmer this got, the better it got. I found it to get less acidic and more fruity as it warmed. It is an excellent beer though not as complex as some of side project's other offerings. Highly recommended"

3633,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.88,"Poured from a can (01Apr2021) into a wine glass L: pours a totally opaque orange juice orange, slightly creamy, with a moderate white head that fades after a minute. Leaves some mild lacing when it does, as does each sip S: creamy orange and mango goodness. Nice tropical and citrus fruit notes leading the way, orange and mango upfront with some pineapple, guava, papaya as well T: follows the nose very well, orange takes over in a welcome way to start. The other fruit plays a supporting role, getting that mango and guava from the nose. There’s a nice citrusy bitterness present from start to (medium/long) finish F: medium+ body, medium carbonation, nicely drying bitterness, very drinkable and smooth O: must be the most flavorful, crushable NEIPA I’ve had. The flavor here is truly remarkable for a sub-7% beer, puts all other singles of the style I’ve had to shame. Refreshing bitterness on a very smooth and soft body, a home run beer"
3634,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,3.99,"Bodhi is only my second of the Top 10 rated IIPAs. I am neither a fan of the style, nor the hype around it."
3635,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.5,"Bottle shared with Jon and Paul.  Sunshine yellow body, moderately hazy, small white collar. Aromas of brett, oak, wine, white grape. Plum character emerges more so in the flavor than the nose. Light and piquant. The finish brings sweet tart candies with a mild acetic note. Outstanding."
3636,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.16,"I'm not the biggest fan of hoppy beers or IPAs, but this is a wonderful beer brewed by masters. The other reviewers touched upon everything I have to say. Excellent beer."
3637,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.86,"Maybe its the psychology of how hard this is to come by or how expensive it is but I loved this one! The only points I took off were for how sticky it leaves everything and for lack of a head. The taste is fantastic ... none of the bitterness of a typical beer of its kind, all of the flavour. If you aren't into sweet beers, this won't be your jam. It takes what Founders Maple Mackinac Fudge does and removes the boozy sting. It tastes like french press coffee, those little maple syrup sugar candies and a bit of chocolate. It keeps the chocolate smooth and without the harsh/bitter pure cocoa notes many stouts these days have. The colour is black with a slight tan head which dissipates quickly. The beer is syrupy and will leave the glass, your lips and anything you touch sticky like resin. Probably the price to pay for such a delightfully sweet beer. I had this on draft at Rogue Island in Providence. At $16 for a 12 oz. pour, it's much better than paying $50 for a bottle. Not sure if I would do that despite how good the beer is. I can see why it's in the top 10 but it seems like most/many of the beers in the top 10 are limited releases with improbable obtainability, so maybe psychology and hype brings them to the top of the list. I wish there were more smooth/less harsh breakfast stouts, like this. Funky Buddah had a good one a year ago. If they came out with a version that added a bacon note, I'd probably drive to the brewery to get it."

3639,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.34,"Does TGBC mis-fire on anything? Sosus is an excellent DIPA, nice citrus-hoppy nose with the perfect amount of malt to hold it all together! Drinkable to the point of being sessionable!"
3640,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.72,"Had a fresh ten ounce pour on tap into a tulip glass. The rich and luscious cocoa-colored foam pours two fingers deep over a nearly black base, and slowly dissolves leaving ample lacing coating the surface and the rim of the glass. Powerfully aromatic maple and coffee is detectable a foot away. Bringing the nose in closer reveals underlying notes of chocolate and an intense maple and coffee that is simply about as pleasing as can be expected from a beer. The taste is fresh maple and coffee, chocolate, molasses and syrup with just a hint of roasted malts and hops from the base beer. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall just short of life changing, but if every coffee stout were this good it would be a better world."
3641,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.24,"CANNED ON 04/26/18 Pours a rather murky orange color with a loose foamy head that clumps around the edges. Bold fruity hop aromas like pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, and stone fruit layered with spicy herbs, wood, and pine resin. Hoppy fresh flavor: green herbs, pink grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and a bit of a raw hop attack on the back end. Smooth, medium body with frothy carbonation and a nice crispness. The sheer lupulin blast (and ABV) cuts down on the refreshment factor - quality stuff though."
3642,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.02,"A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is hazy yellowish with a half-finger of white head that settles quickly. S: Tropical fruit salad - mango, pineapple, papaya and ripe melon. T: Juicy ripe canteloupe. Papaya and mango. Ripe oranges & creamsicle. Sweeter tropical fruits dominate the overall impression.  M: Juicy, low-carbonation.  O: Meh - a little too sweet for me. . . ."
3643,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.96,"2020 vintage: Jet black, low head retention but a stubborn ring of lacing. Huge coconut and chocolate on the nose. The taste is really unbelievable, as far as staying true to the title. I've been told by several this is the best vintage yet, and I can understand why. Pastry stouts are already somewhat gimmicky by nature, but this one delivers the adjuncts in a way that is somehow both aggressive and balanced. It finishes thick, smooth and lingers for a while. This is a real treat, and delivers on the hype in a way that I rarely see. Drink fresh."
3644,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,3.49,"Tart berry mix and roasty sweet chocolate finish? I’m not a berry the stouts guy anyway so just not up my alley as far as flavor profile goes but that’s what this is right, an individual posting their own opinion on a beer. Happy to tick another tough top250 find but I won’t seek out again"
3645,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.56,"one of the highest beers remaining on my personal want to drink list, so i was overjoyed to see it on offer at the brewery when we were there recently! its been one ive always wanted to try, and to get it have it, side by side, next to the original, was a nice a thing as i could imagine. after careful study, i have to say, as delicious and awesome as this is, abraxas doesnt need the coffee. not that i was let down or disappointed by this, not at all, quite the opposite, its stunning, but the original is the original, it has such perfect balance, and the dark malt in it does everything that coffee would, making the coffee almost superfluous, thus in the coffee edition they have to add so much coffee to push it through the grain that it seems almost a touch out of balance, or rather more coffee driven at the expense of the other added ingredients, not out of balance, the balance is still huge and awesome, i just get a little less from the cinnamon and pepper in here than i do in the original. the coffee is a lot, its bitter for sure, and it also has just a little acidity that kind of interrupts the smoothness the other one has. the depth of this is insane though, and in the coffee i also get leather, burnt wood, smoke, and chocolate, really compelling. it has nice linger, sexy warmth going down, and feels as fancy as it is. a rarity i feel so lucky to have encountered in this fashion, by surprise right at the source! as epic as this is, i still think with a gun to my head i pick the original. yeah i said it. still, this is as good a coffee stout as you will ever find. wow! worth the wait!"

3647,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.78,"Pours a orangish yellowish hazy color. Mild head retention. Smells of acidic apricots with a nice barnyard funk. Taste is incredibly balanced with the tart, acidity predominate but very smooth. There is not much alcohol taste with this high ABV. One of the best wild ales I have ever had."
3648,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.6,"One of my favorite double IPAs. Trillium in Mass. got this one right. Brewed with raw local honey, the hop flavors in this hazy are amazing. Citrusy heavy."
3649,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.97,"I will say this is probably the best barley wine I tasted. It poured a dark murky brown - almost like prune juice (but not in a bad way!). Very little head, probably due to high alcohol content. The smell is just delicious - picked up notes of heavy dark fruits soaked in bourbon with oak, toffee, and vanilla. More than what words can describe. The taste was just outstanding - again tons of bourbon soaked dark fruits. Very sweet with notes of toffee and vanilla that became more prominent at room temperature. The bourbon was up front from start to finish with a nice spiciness. There is just a subtle hop bite but its pretty much a desert in the glass. No alcohol warmth despite its ultra high ABV content. Very full-bodied, sticky, and rich. Overall: seek this out, it will not disappoint! Because of its high alcohol content, I was glad to share with a friend."

3656,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.92,Thanks bulbman for the hookup Look: Black with red circles around the top of the beer. Very little tan head and leaves the glass with a great coating Smell: The nose of this beer like pretty much everything is just amazing. There is so many layers to the nose I am not sure where to start. The brandy really shines through with some dark chocolate brownies behind that. Traces of vanilla pass by the nose as well as a touch of chili peppers Taste: Holy fucking bananas batman this is amazing. The beer has this wonderful chocolate covered cherry character brought forth by the brandy and right when you think the beer can't get any better it totally changes bringing forth lots of vanilla and fudge. Then a third wave takes over and you get a nice amount of chili pepper and molasses that just works perfectly together. But wait there's more. The beer finishes with that same chocolate covered cherry flavor.  Mouthfeel: Thick as hell and low to no carbonation(could be more) Oily as hell and you can just feel it coating your insides Overall: This is the perfect dessert beer and is definitely in my top 3 beers of all time. I am glad that another growler just arrived at my doorstep. Holy hell this beer is almost perfect and I honestly can't see a beer being much better
3657,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.3,"Cloudy yellow with two fingers of creamy, off-white head. The head sticks around for a good while and leaves heavy lacing. Creamy orange aroma — like an Orange Julius made with tangerines and clementines. There’s an explosion of citrus medley up front in the taste, with clementine, tangerine, orange, lime that again includes some creaminess and light sweetness, but that’s cut by a pithy, grassy finish. There’s a slight mineral water / soda water element to it as well that prevents the fruits from being over the top. Medium bodied and smooth feel with just enough carbonation. Really excellent beer. 10/22/18 canned on date."
3658,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,5.0,"Batches vary from year to year. Served on draft at the brewery for 2020. It's chewy, fishy, barrel heavy and really enjoyable in small quantities. My only complaint is that it's served so cold off the draft line."

3660,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.87,"Poured from a 32 oz. growler into a snifter. Like the regular Hunahpu's, the Apple Brandy Barrel Aged Hunahpu's pours a viscous dark black chocolate color with a barely noticeable tan head around the ring of the glass. The aroma is full, complex, and somehow elevated beyond the greatness the original Hunahpu's achieves. The brandy is noticeable and seems to gently overlay the other aromas, which are consistent with the regular Hunahpu's: dark chocolate, a bit of espresso, vanilla, with a bit of pepper and a slightly fruity apple presence. Each sip is nearly perfect. The dark chocolate fudge, roasted malt, and creamy espresso notes all blend amazingly well with a brandy flavor. The middle of the sip contains the zenith of its complexity, with the apple coming through, mixing with oak and vanilla from the barrel, and a bit of residual chocolate flavor. The end of the sip wraps the treat up nicely, leaving a nice brandy flavor in my mouth. The brandy mellows out the sticky sweetness that the base beer contains, and the barrel definitely lightens up the carbonation a little bit as well. It is creamy and smooth, with the brandy cutting through the thickness of Hunahpu's as well. This beer really just has the perfect body, carbonation, and smoothness that I am looking for. After tasting Hunahpu's for the first time I did not think there was any way to improve on it, but after having the whiskey and the brandy, I have changed my opinion. This is such an incredible beer."

3664,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.68,"2014 batch drank on my wedding day 1/20/2017 L-slight haze, bright lemon gold with a white head Smell and taste follow each other which is best stated as ""complex"". The honey and lemon come through nicely just like Anna and there's a nice tartness added as well. The wine barrel is prevalent and adds a nice level of bitterness and oak. I would have guessed a subtle red wine barrel, but it seems more like chardonnay is the likely barrel used. Makes perfect sense. Earthiness and floral tones were present as well and the overall lingering unique note was something either cinnamon or comparable to it. It was really incredible within everything else in this beer. Feel-soft, drinkable, delicate Overall-exceptional. Due to the ""whale""-ness of this beer, I highly doubt I will be able to drink this again, but man it was great. Very enjoyable. Perfect wedding day celebration."
3665,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.61,"Soft yellow haziness. Thin, soft head. Classic subtlety and minimalism of a Maine Beer co brew. Notes of grapefruit zest and grass. The beer drinks great from the first sip to the last. Deserving of their top score."
3666,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.1,"Hazy orange body with a bubbly white head. Aromas of oak, vanilla, stone fruit. The apricot character is not especially assertive. While the beer is certainly tasty, it's less extraordinary than I hoped / expected. Lightly sweet, mild to medium tartness and a subtle acetic quality in the finish. Good stuff."
3667,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.54,"Much more aggressively bitter than normal Pseudo Sue. This one steps over into the west coast IPA territory! Piney flavor like galangal. Really delightful smell and taste. Great head retention. Not necessarily better than pseudo sue, but different and also great."

3669,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,3.45,2-1-19: 2017 version from bottle at home. The heat with this one is mild. I can definitely taste the cinnamon. This seems a bit thin. For me the hype doesn't quite match the taste. Maybe I need to try this fresher.
3670,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.62,"Copper filtered with moderate carbonation and 4 fingers of off white head. Smells amazing of dank onion and garlic with a balance of fruity guava, mangos and pineapple. Tastes of fried garlic and durian, jackfruit, soursop, and mango. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a deep alcoholic burn. I got this at Boneyard Pub in a crowler yesterday in Bend OR, and am enjoying it in Spokane WA, Aug 17, 2019. One of the best beers I’ve had!"
3671,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.75,"D:11/22/20 - At 6+ wks, this is still arguably perfect. Unmistakable fresh fruit salad notes. Bitter and dank swirl late. Would really love to A-B one at this stage w/ a fresh one."
3672,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.2,"Definitely a solid offering, but frankly I had higher expectations. I much prefer other Allagash similar offerings like Bizou (only at the brewery) and Nancy. Either way, a solid beer."
3673,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.27,"this is a beer i have been hearing about and reading about for what seems like forever, so it was awesome to finally get to try it, one of those beers of lore, always wondered how much better than everything else can something like this really be, and the answer is that it probably was considerably better than whatever anyone else was doing with this style when it was first introduced more than a decade ago. now, it kind of just seems like another one. thats not a knock against it of course, it was clearly a pioneering beer and more of a trend setter than these guys probably could have imagined, less clear than what was popular at the time, but certainly not hazy for the sake of it, although this could be credited at least partially with making room for such things. i love the hop complexion, i get the columbus way ahead of the galaxy, its so hoppy that i can almost taste the pellets, the greenness, the vegetal element not just the compounds we desire in the beer. its juicy and its kind of sweet from the pale barley malt too, but there is a lot of orange juice, grapefruit zest, and pine needle character here, very northwestern to me, slick and oily feeling and dense as can be, almost woody like lumber, and with a lot of body too, its a big one for sure, perfectly appropriately named. the bitterness is all after the swallow which is cool, its a long trajectory of flavors. citrus abounds as well later on, a honey taste and richness in the middle, and very good, although possibly not as well refined and distinctive as i thought it would be after all the hype over the years. i think, like pliny or something, that the rest of the field has caught up enough where this isnt as mindblowingly unique as it probably once was, but that does not diminish its excellence..."
3674,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.4,"A- 1.5 inch creamy head that holds well; cloudy. S- bread, yeast, apple juice with hints of citrus. T - Sour fruits, orange, yeast. M - Medium body with some crispness and burn. O - Very easy to drink; fruity and fun; not very bitter."
3675,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.58,So I'm going to blend the scores here. Aged LPG and fresh LPG are two different animals. This is comparison of a 2010 sticker vs. a 2007 sticker. Had the 2010 on 12/21/15 and then 2007 on 1/1/16. 2010 L: Looks like carbonated apple juice. Copper/amber hue with plenty of carb. 4.5.
3676,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.35,"2015 Bottle. 18.6% ABV. Dark pour, subtle crimson hue just like the others. Some thin, frothy head bubbles up on the pour, but it’s got a good look and the head dissipates quickly with no lace left behind.  Loads of coffee on the nose with subtle but not unpleasant notes of green pepper. Many more experienced beer drinkers know green pepper to be an oxidation side effect in stouts that have coffee in them. Not abnormal, but not typically preferred. Those subtle hints of oxidation don’t take away from anything, though, with a predominance of espresso, baker’s chocolate, charred oak barrel, and bourbon aromas. Rich notes of chocolate and coffee hit first, with less green pepper than on the nose. Overall, for a beer that is recommended to be consumed fresh has held up really well. Some charred oak character emerges as the beer warms and helps to compliment that bourbon flavor. Really nice balance between the base beer, the barrel, and the adjuncts.  Nice medium weight to the beer, with low carbonation and a warm, boozy finish. Mildly viscous and not overly syrupy."
3677,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.77,"L: pours a super thick dark brown. No head, looks amazing."
3678,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.59,Pours pitch black with a medium mocha colored head. Smells great with notes of barrel present but not overpowering. Tastes like a lot of chocolatey goodness and roasted coffee. Very rich feel and taste. Great barrel taste and balance. Think this reminds me a lot of BA Expedition.
3679,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.4,"On tap at vintage estate boardman ohio. Snifter pour L - thick and chewy looking. Heavy amount of thick head. Disappointing looking carbonation. Very large bubbles as opposed to tight froth. Not a worth class high abv look at all. S - big, big maple. Nice coffee. Cream. Lightly burnt sugar. Just loads of maple T - definitely the most maple forward beer ive ever had by a country mile. The coffee is dark and roasty. The base of this beer is classic and roasty like an expedition stout and not overly sweet like a bcbs. The maple starkly contrasts the roast and plays on the base nicely. F - is nice but not mind blowing. O - very great beer but not exactly leaps and bounds above a plethora of other beers that are similar. Top 250? Yeah. Number 10? Nah. I actually wound up with these 2 times in large beer trades but never drank them because I didn't believe they'd be worth the $100 in other beer I could trade them for. I was not wrong. I wouldn't pay more than $15 for this to drink if it were on the shelf."
3680,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.5,"batch 4 drank in a wine glass on 8/3/2017 L - slightly hazy yellow...thin white head, little lacing S/T - white wine strong, oak, lemon, fresh cut grass, hay, slight funk, little green apple and grape F - smooth as a baby's bottom, really soft but dense, subtle tartness Overall - incredibly done, not overly complex, but really enjoyable. Totally understandable that this is the base for some of the best fruited saisons on the planet."

3682,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.49,"Batch 8 (June 2018), poured into a JK SPON tulip. The look is amazing; deep ruby, almost mistakable for a Bordeaux. Moderate carbonation that dissipates very quickly. The nose is full of jammy raspberry and signature JK funk; moderately musty, dusty, and woody. Palate is mildly tart and acetic, with plenty of jammy raspberry, oak, and some yogurt (especially on the finish); getting close to a fruited lambic in style. Very enjoyable."
3683,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,5.0,"absolutely fantastic, everything I hoped it would be! Looks like a perfect (Double) shot of espresso, with a dark caramel colored head. Wonderful coffee aroma which comes though perfectly without any boozieness that a lot of stouts tend to carry."

S: Orange, peach, apricot. None of the dirty socks aroma that sometimes comes with Simcoe. T: Follows the aroma up front, then pivots to grapefruit in the middle. Finishes quite dry with just a slight bitterness. F: Super soft mouthfeel, appropriate carbonation.  O: An outstanding IPA. The aromas and flavors are subtle but distinct, and the mouthfeel is sublime."
3686,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.28,Very solid smooth IPA. Contains Australian galaxy hops with peach Clementine fruit and pine. Didn’t think it was amazing compared to other offerings like DDH fort point but solid.
3687,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.5,"Can dated 9/16/20, poured into a snifter glass. Mocha color, attractive head that quickly dissipated, leaving lots of lacing. Chocolate, peanut butter, coffee smell. Tastes like a Reese’s peanut butter cup dunked in coffee. Nice, lingering finish with carbonation. Not overly sweet. Nicely done. Would buy this again."
3688,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.74,"Poured from a 750ml bottle in to a tulip glass. Look: Has a nice clear red color with a short lasting white head Smell: Smells of berries and slightly sweet, also with an acidic touch Taste: Tastes closely with how it smells, although with very little sweetness overall, which is a good thing to me for this type of beer. Feel: Slightly fizzy, not a heavy beer Overall: Usually with size of beer I'm a believer in sharing with someone else to then move on to another, but I am always tempted to hog this one. Will drink it whenever I find available."
3689,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,3.55,Thanks to yllib for fresh can. 
3690,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.74,On draft at Hill Farmstead. Reminds me of a more refined Morning Delight. It doesn’t smack you in the face with maple like MD. I am a really big fan.
3691,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.71,"2018 bottle on site at Toronado. I think it was worth every penny and if you’re on the fence and reading this, just get it! This definitely holds up to the current state of American Wild ales in 2019 and I don’t think this is overhyped or whatever. It’s a truly special beer and a treat to enjoy."
3692,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.72,Batch 2 A: Golden straw with some head that doesn't want to stick around.
3693,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.73,Always tough to balance fruits with barrel aged flavor but this one is harmonious. Huge fan of rye barrel flavors already so this templeton barrel is right up my alley though I am not a huge raspberry fan. However this works. Nose is literally a chocolate covered raspberries with subtle sweet rye barrel notes. Dessert beer start with a little booze barrel on the finish. Great beer.
3694,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.31,"Pours a rich golden grain. Minimal white foam. Vinous funk aroma. It's soft and delicate, lightly tart, vinous but subtly so. A little cheese funk comes out as it warms. There's a little bitterness on the finish. Just a touch. Overall, a very good wine barrel farmhouse ale."
3695,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.48,"Poured 32oz crowler into snifter. Obsidian in color with huge 3 finger foamy mocha head. Slowly fades into a nice cap and thick collar and webbed lacing on my glass. Roasted malts, coffee, cocoa and rich dark chocolate blend with hints of pepper and earthiness. Flavor is bold with the Speedyway stout base, loaded with bitter chocolate, cold pressed coffee, hints of roasted malt and cocoa. Some earthiness from the hops along with hints of pepper and cream. Thick body, chewy and sticky. Rich, smooth and creamy. Really nice coffee addition to SS."
3696,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.65,"Pours a very dark brown with ruby accents as it leaves the bottle and on the edges of the glass. No head. Aroma is toasty, roasty, caramel, butterscotch, herbal and floral hops. Flavor profile is butterscotch, toffee, caramel, and roasty, toasty malts. Big, deep complexity. Mouth feel is thick with a chewy texture. Overall, big, firm and filling. This is amazing.  Served from a 750mL bottle at the Side Project Cellar."
3697,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.56,A - Pours a soft yellowish orange with a 1/2 inch foamy head.
3698,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.28,"Foggier Window from Monkish. A DDH DIPA clocking in at 8.1%. Thick yellow haze with mango nectar accents. Aromas of gooseberry, pinot grigio, orange peel, pineapple, spruce tip, and peppercorn. Taste follows with additional layers of mixed berries, tropical fruit, and kiwi. Texture is soft & creamy up front, and slightly chalky & bitter on the finish. Another well-executed beer from Monkish."
3699,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.65,"Bright veiled orange body, small white head diminishing to a ring, foam sticking to the glass, leaving lots of lacings. Nose: Peaches, peaches and peaches again, that juicy peach you would get the juice all over your hands and mouth while eating it. Beautifully funky. Sourness, juicy peaches up front, a lot of yeasty component, very long aftertaste, you just can't get enough! That mouthfeel is wrapping all around, the abv is not noticeable at all!"
3700,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.5,"canned 9.16.19, opened 10.27.19 ""if life were easy and not so fast"" Poured into a Nonic, black motor oil liquid, solid creamy brown two finger foam cap , good lacings, good retention aroma is sweet milk chocolate  taste is sweet milk chocolate upfront, hint of bitterness from the roasted malts on the finish creamy, medium sudsing  Good beer"
3701,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.65,"04/2016 - This is a superb American representation of a gueuze; incredible minerality on the nose, plus funk, barnyard, oak; the palate is lightly creamy, funky, earthy, and a touch of lemon zest; so excited to see how this matures!"
3702,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.47,Poured a dark brown/nearly black with two fingers of mocha head. 
3703,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.37,"Soft gold, foamy head. Aroma has underripe melon, faint lemon, musty hop. Palate is pretty balanced, not super juicy, more earthy fruit flavors like stone fruit, maybe a little apricot, with some grassy earthy hops. Medium bitterness"
3704,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.25,2268
3705,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.65,"This one pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like white wine, sour candy, peach, citrus, oak, and a deep dirty funk. This has the complexity of actual Belgian lambic for sure, but maybe a bit more brash and aggressive than the most traditional takes. There's lots of white wine and white fruit flavors (white peach, white grape, etc). There's also bit of citrus rind and pepper, and definitely some spicy oak. This is so wonderfully delicious. This is light bodied, clean, and very drinkable, with not a ton of lingering acidity. This is definitely one of the best beers that de Garde has done - it's mighty good."
3706,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.6,"2nd DL variant. Regular DL is good but the variants that I have tried (BBA, CHEMTRAIL, FVM, RRARI CROCHET, LOADSTAR, PORTUGUESE BRANDY BA) were all amazing."
3707,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.85,"Was fortunate to try this a few weeks back onsite. What an amazing delicious beer. Smells great, feels great. Great complexity with it. Very happy to say I tried it and it lived up to what I thought it would be."
3708,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.46,"been meaning to try this for a long time but it is tricky to find in dublin, found myself in an off license on baggot street yesterday and picked it up, bottled june 2020, a cloudy honey colour beer with a smattering of white bubbles on top, aroma is funk forward, tart, leathery, goaty, acidic, sweet, caramel, honey, pear, apple, rhubarb, lime, smells gorgeous frankly, taste is sweeter than other gueuzes i’ve tried, but totally delicious, the balance between the funky sour flavours, the acidic wooden flavours and the sweetness is perfect, rhubarb, cherry, pear, honeycomb, vanilla, oak, white wine, leathery, floral, feint hint of bitterness on the finish, beer is light to medium bodied with light carbonation, dry, puckering sourness, very drinkable, all in all a damn good beer that lives up to its reputation"

3710,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.55,"The beer pours a Pitch Black with a thin film of khaki head that immediately recedes. The carbonation is low. It smells of chocolate, mocha, chilli peppers, cinnamon, hint of vanilla, and bourbon. The beer tastes of chocolate, chilli peppers, mocha, cinnamon, bark, with a bourbon kick. The mouthfeel is light and creamy, lots of complexity and so smooth. This is a special beer, there aren’t many big stouts that I could drink all day and this is one of them."
3711,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.68,"Today our fence is being repaired after a Tornado ripped through the neighborhood almost three weeks ago, so I am celebrating by drinking Cantillon Lou Pepe Framboise (2015). It was among the best Lambics that I've ever had. Look: dark red with an inch thick off-white head Aroma: raspberry, white wine.  Taste: The flavor is tart raspberry, lots of raspberry, lemon, oak, white wine, and there's a very long and pleasant tart and dry raspberry after taste. Body/Overall: medium body"
3712,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.44,"Poured from bottle to glass chalice. Color is deep brown with an ivory, almost khaki head. The head falls to a loose cap. Smell reminds me of me of a warm bread pudding with notes of brown sugar, malt, and candied fruit. A healthy dose of spice here too. Taste is much more balanced than the nose would suggest. Sweet entry, with raisin, fig, brown sugar up front. Middle balances out with some bitterness and a layer of hope spice. Finishes clean with a bit of alcohol bite. Feel is medium to full with decent carbonation. Overall, this is tasty. I wish the flavors were a bit bolder, but still an excellent beer all around."
3713,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.7,"I am drinking Perennial Artisan Ales renowned Coffee Abraxas brewed with Ancho Chili Peppers, Cacao Nibs, Cinnamon, Vanilla and Dark Matter Coffee, ABV 11.50%. This a big Imperial Stout in a big bottle. I am drinking from my one liter Disneyland Cup. It is thick, jet black, syrup like, oily, smooth, a creamy mocca head, coffee and pepper aromas. The flavor is mostly roasted malts and bitter coffee but there is also chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla, and some smokiness. Abraxas is an ancient charm with magical spells and this Stout is magical. You may think it is overwhelming and too much, like drinking black motor oil if you are not into stouts. If you like a big stout from time to time than it is magical with it's high concentration of stout qualities and flavors. It has a bitter coffee flavor but I should say it is not too much. There's no off-putting flavor in it, which is amazing considering how much is going on. I am drinking it fresh as suggested. It is a great big stout if you can take it. Summary: Look: Jet black with a two inch mocca colored head Aroma: roasted malts, coffee, chocolate Taste: coffee, chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla, and some smokiness. Body/Overall: full body, thick, oily"
3714,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.6,"Man this is dynamite. Pour is yellowish with nice tight bubbly head. Blasts of tropical fruits - pineapple, mango & guava with the pine in the background. The palate is luscious with a hint of malt to compliment the tropical and citrus notes. Tangerine and pineapple are the biggest takeaways. Finishes beautifully."
3715,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.28,Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer pours a hazy orange color with creamy bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up and fading to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour is complete.
3716,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.45,"Two 22oz bottles picked up by my wife's best friend at Belmont Station in Portland, Oregon."
3717,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.91,"Had this at the taproom with lunch. Delicious. Dark brown chocolate color with just a slight tan head. Big bourbon aromas. Taste is at first just a smooth bourbon, but follows with some stone fruit, cherry, peach. Nice complexity. Mouth is smooth, medium body. Overall, a delicious and very drinkable BA ale."
3718,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,"For purposes of the review, both 2017 and 2018 were sampled together. Appearance - The beer had the vicious blackness of Dark Lord.  Smell - The 2018 had more sweet chocolate marshmallow. 2017 leaned more Earthy and dry but still had an overall sense of sweetness.  Taste - The 2018 had amazing notes of toasted marshmallow, chocolate syrup, vanilla, and char in back. The 2017 was not as sweet, but still had notes of sweet vanilla and chocolate. In both bottles, there was a sweet quality of kids’ breakfast cereals. Amazing there is almost no burn from the 15% abv.  Mouthfeel - on par with motor oil, the beer has amazing thickness. It clings like few others.  Overal - Holy diabetes! The beer should be too sweet, but it is so good. Further, it appears the beer is best consumed fresh."
3719,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.38,"L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dark, mahogany brown color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a half inch of creamy, off white, fairly long-lasting head. Excellent lacing. S: A very enticing aroma of maple syrup, coffee, bacon, malt, caramel, and chocolate. T: Tasted of a moderate amount of coffee (not as much as I expected), lots of maple syrup, a bit of chocolate (not overly prevalent), mild notes, some malt, and a hint of caramel. This is a big, complex flavor. It's a little weird and chalky in the finish, but it definitely does its job. It's sweet, rich, and quite delicious. F: A decent amount of carbonation with a somewhat overly dry finish. Full-bodied. O: Despite some very minor flaws, this is a well done beer. Drinkable."
3720,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.62,"Thanks to Kyle Beautiful purple pour Jammy, seedy, fruit is very expressive. Acetic sour notes are strong but fruit remains bold and present. I half expected to pull seeds from my mouth.....crazy good."
3721,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.18,"A huge thanks to the captain of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of oranges, pine. Taste is dank, pine, oranges, hints of mango, very bitter. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a very good beer."
3722,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,3.76,Idk I see all the ratings and maybe my palette is fried today but this is outrageously bland. Probably need to just try it again this is doing literally nothing at all for me. 
3723,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,5.0,"A: Gold, white head that sticks around forever. Hazy, great looking beer. S: Funky...so much funk. That Hill yeast smell, some oak and lemon. T: Lemon, funk, oak, hay, basement...all I want in a beer. M: Carb is right where it needs to be. Keeps it soft and finishes dry, making you want more. O: This beer is exactly what I wanted it to be and more. It's oaky, funky and perfect. Way to go Shaun, you never disappoint"
3724,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.68,"Poured from a bomber into a J. Wakefield snifter glass.  Super hazy, OJ-looking yellow-orange body with a nice frothy white head that reduces to leave leggy lacing and a layer of retention.  Aroma is straight guava juice with passionfruit and sour citrus. Taste is very pulpy and tart but not super sour with tons of guava, passionfruit, melon, TROPICAL, lactic sourness, tons of citrus, a little grassy, perfectly drinkable with a light body. Super crisp and refreshing. Hard to not drink really quick.  So incredibly balanced and tasty. Might be the best berliner I've ever tasted."
3725,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.44,"finally got my lips on this one, an extra hopped version of their now famous pale ale, and its predictably awesome. the thing about this, and about so many of the dry hoppy trillium beers really, is that they seem to know when to stop, and in some ways, i like this as much for what it isnt as i do for what it is. its not green and vegetal and forced, over saturated, harsh, or bitey, and that alone makes it better than so many others out there in this style right now. soft yellow even light greenish in color, its muted looking, thin, and nicely bubbly. it smells awesome, citra all over this, but not modern day citra, like citra when it first came into vogue and nobody could get enough of it, so distinctive and fresh, lemony and lemongrassy, with a beautiful freshness to it that almost is as relevant as the aroma it contributes. light green tea, a softly starchy but dry grain base, and a level of refinement evident that i am not used to in these. the flavor is as good as the nose, pineapple and honeydew and lemon zest all come to mind, but this isnt intense for all the dry hops it has, they seem so well integrated, not just on the surface but fundamental to what this is, and that is rare. light bitterness at the end but enough for this to appear balanced. awesome carbonation makes it feel really light, and the grain base is dry and simple but rustic enough to contribute something, and i really like that with the juicy hops in here. a really worthy beer, highly acclaimed and for good reason."
3726,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.99,"Batch 2. Poured form bottle into snifter. Dark amber color. Nose is caramel, cognac and raisins. The taste follows he nose. The cognac blends so perfectly here. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth. Overall this is the best barelywine I have had the opportunity to enjoy."
3727,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.74,"Great mouth feel. Nice smell of booze and chocolate. Pours a nice dark black, very viscous. Mouth feel is nice and smooth. Chile and vanilla comes through nicely at the end."
3728,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,3.8,"(on tap at Pinocchio's 9th anniversary event... served in a 5 oz snifter) Rather mute and one-note, with only a little bourbon presence... big dominant flavor is that of a malty dark chocolate chip milk; luckily not a sweet and syrupy chocolate, but chocolate and little else... little roast, little char... I do fondly remember the delicious flavors of Elijah Craig 12-yr, and there was very little here to reminisce about... really dangerously smooth, with the alcohol very well hidden, but probably wouldn't buy a bottle"
3729,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.18,"Not sweet like other Tree House stouts. Huge coffee, roast, chocolate. Slight green pepper present on the nose. Great creamy mouthfeel. ABV well hidden."
3730,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.27,"Poured into a 13 oz Teku glass canned on 3/17/21. Pours a very attractive slightly cloudy orange with a finger sticky white head that leaves thin wisps of lace with nice retention. 4.5 Aroma pine, tangerine, apricot, and grapefruit rind. 4.25 Taste follows simple but really good. Pine, tangerine, apricot, and grapefruit really well balanced with just the right amount of bitterness. 4.25 Mouthfeel is above average, maybe a whisker dry, plenty of carbonation, and goes down really easy. 4.25 Overall this is an excellent East-West DIPA, one of the best non NEDIPAs I have had in a long time. Thanks Jzeilinger for this can. 4.25"
3731,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.67,Poured from a 16oz can dated 12/19/19 to a diagonally cut tumbler.
3732,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.27,"On tap at The Bench. Pours a hazy yellowish orange with very little head. Lots of lacing. Great nose of berries and fruits. Pure Mosaic hops. The taste is fruity pebbles, pineapple, guava, mango and pineapple. Medium body with a slightly dry mouthfeel and some alcohol heat."
3733,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.55,A-Pours a dark amber color with no head or lacing
3734,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.23,"Batch 2, 2014 bottling poured into a snifter appears a dark chestnut color with a khaki head that fades leaving stringy lace. Aroma is vinous, raisony, caramel, molasses, oak and herbal hops. Little sherry accent as it breathes. Taste is sweet with caramel, vanilla, molasses, slight oak, vinous and herbal. Boozy as it warms but yet remains quite sweet throughout. This is one thick bodied brew, so viscous and chewy with moderate to lower levels of carbonation. I heard nothing but amazing things about this beer and while it was good, I think a lot of the residual sugar in this covered up some otherwise enjoyable nuance. Regardless I would seek this out again because it is quite tasty."
3735,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a clear, glowing, orange color like an ember from a dying campfire. A tall slightly white head. SRM of 9.0. (4.25) Aroma: Strong aromas of dank tropical fruit and resinous orange citrus. Some tropical melon, berry, grapefruit, and pineapple. Resinous and tropical. Also some dank pine underneath with some caramel malt body. (4.25) Flavor: Strong flavors of rich orange and tropical fruit. pine, and more resinous orange with a strong pine bitterness in the middle. Then a spicy caramel malt body with some more dank and resinous fruity notes before a bitter pine finish. (4.25) Feel: Medium body, but a heavier mouthfeel. It captures the IPA level of hop flavor bitter astringency on the tongue, but follow with the perfect amount of malt sweetness to leave you wondering whether it's bitter, sweet, or both. (4.25) Compared to PsuedoSue: This one has a darker amber color. It has more dank and earthy notes. Not as airy. Less piney. A stronger bitterness. Much heavier bodied and more resiny. Not quite as smooth. Leans more toward an IPA. to Alpha King 8/15/21: Pours a much lighter color. More resinous and orange. More orange, pine, and bitterness. Less stonefruit and spiced caramelized malts. Lighter flavors and more citrus overall.  Overall: An top shelf beer. This one has strong orange, pine, bitterness with a sweet malt profile. I was initially blown away by the citrus hop flavors and pine bitterness, yet it has such a strong malt balance to counteract that. It's the perfect balanced pale ale here and I'm not sure whether it finishes bitter or sweet. I think that's what makes it finish so well and would rate this pale ale as a top not because of that. Lots of orange citrus and pine nonetheless. I think it pioneered the style for citrus IPAs. (Final Rating: 4.30)"
3736,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.13,"OG of IPAs…. By today’s standards don’t think I’m giving it 100, but definitely need to have at least once in your life! Not the palate review ya’ll we’re expecting"
3737,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.26,"Rich copper color and unctuous mouthfeel. Malty and hoppy. This is a very well-made beer. But as with so many pioneers in so many fields, the rest of the field eventually caught up, and this isn't as remarkable as it once was."
3738,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.46,"Rich, dense, smooth and delicious. Tons of cocoa, caramel, vanilla, coffee with subtle waves of anise, bourbon and black currants. Very complex and tasty. I will definitely get this one again if I come across it."
3739,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.5,"Bottle shared thanks to Maakun. Hazy pale golden with a white head. Notes of funk, minerals - salt, baking soda - peaches. Light tart and very complex. Medium body, medium carbonation and a tart, floral and fruity aftertaste."
3740,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.68,2015 vintage
3741,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.08,Man just too thick and syrupy for my taste. Felt like I had to take insulin after drinking this. No way could I do more than 4-5 ounces. Lots of chocolate with some spices
3742,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.09,"Very nice apricot sour. Pours a golden color with subtle apricot notes. Tart on the tongue, but dry and subtle apricot notes become subtle apricot flavor on the palate. Great brew that I hope to have again"
3743,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.96,"Pours really nice with a relatively thick tan head. Smells wonderful, tons of maple followed by roasty coffee. Taste is underwhelming compared to the smell. Neither the maple nor the coffee is as strong as you would expect from the nose, and the base beer is not tasty enough to back them up. Some bitterness comes through, but it's almost burnt-tasting, not sure if that's from the malts or the coffee. Feel is not great. Not really very thick for an 11% stout, and it's a little over-carbed too. Overall, a fairly good beer, but disappointing. I would probably like it a lot more if I hadn't tasted other far-superior coffee/maple stouts like ISLBS and Imperial Falling Colors."
3744,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.6,"Pours a cloudy, deep blond with a rocky cap that lasts a long time, draping the glass in foam. Lemon, white grape, straw, horse blanket in the nose. Oak notes, lemon, rustic funk, saltine pale malts in the taste. Herbal, spicy yeast notes in the back add layers of complexity to the mix. The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with walls of textured, creamy carbonation. The finish is tart, fruity and funky, lasting a long time. This is yet another stellar, ultra complex and ultra drinkable Wild Ale from the OG producer. It lives up to the hype and is a must try for any fan of the style."
3745,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.57,"Can. Hazy dark yellow pour with a white head. Citrus and tropical fruit bouquet. Super well balanced with slightly prickly carbonation. Mildly bitter hops, with heavy citrus notes, blend harmoniously with sturdy caramel malts. Hints of pineapple with maybe just a flutter of vanilla in the finish. Outstanding body and mouthfeel. A world class IPA."
3746,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.49,"Vintage 2020 A: Pours a deep brown, almost black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap S: Roasted malt, cinnamon, cacao, vanilla, dark chocolate, and chili peppers T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of roasted malt, cinnamon, and cacao. Picks up the vanilla, dark chocolate, caramel, light tobacco, and the chili peppers. Finishes with lingering cinnamon and cacao M: Full bodied with low-moderate carbonation. Creamy from the lactose O: A great Mexican-styled stout with plenty of cinnamon and chocolate to go around. A great sipper at 11.5%. Definitely worth checking out"
3747,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.34,"Heavy chocolate in the nose. Lighter in the taste with a fair amount of boozyness. That taste is not overtaken by the alcohol, but has a slight boozy feel on the tongue. The chocolate was subtle but tasty. Heavy but wonderful for the 12 ounce size can!"
3748,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.45,L: Beautiful clear orange liquid with small head that doesn't last long.
3749,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.47,Drank at the brewery.
3750,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.69,Tasted from 2018 bottle. Pours black with faint light brown head. Aroma of peppers and cinnamon. Flavor is moderately sweet. Nice pepper flavor with chocolate and cinnamon. Just a faint hint of tequila that I wouldn’t have picked up without knowing. Some caramel and bourbon notes. Complex and extremely well done.
3751,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.36,"Pour produced a common frothy top that befits many a cloudy beer. The coloring fits on the paler yellow end, lacking ay orange hue that some hazies bring to the table. The aforementioned head had some stickiness to it and provided a fair amount of lacing. I am not getting a burst of aromas from the nose, but the aromas I am getting is pretty standard for the style. Starting out I perceive a bit of the malt and alternatives and a somewhat muddled citrus note. I then get a little sweet melon thread through grapefruit and tangerine. The aromas are whispering that this beer might actually have some bitterness, and I think I am getting a familiar yeast note, as well - though I couldn't say why. Ok, the opening starts like I expected with the m/alts laying down a dry gray/hay base. Citra fruit pith come next, but there is also a sugary sweetness peeking out from the corner. It's mildly distracting but doesn't drive out the notes that I am enjoying; in fact the sweetness fades and melds into the raw/bitter citrus rind notes to bring out a bit of tropical fruit flesh. What I take as oat/wheat in the hazy NE IPAs I get next. It seems to help carry the citrus rind through - especially the pith and the bitterness that brings is the last thing I'm left with as the beer enters my gullet. A very good IPA that brings some fruitiness but stays grounded with some back end bitterness."

3753,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,3.98,"Pours hazy straw yellow, two fingers of head that recedes slowly with lots of lacing. Nose is tropical citrus, lemon, mango, pineapple.  Taste follows, lemon, mango, some notes of pine/resin. Feel is excellent, slightly creamy full bodied, good carbonation, leaves a slight sticky lingering feeling.  Overall excellent hazy IPA from Treehouse as usual"
3754,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.49,"750ml bottle.  Pours opaque, oily black with barely a trace of brown head.  Espresso, chocolate, vanilla, and fudge in the nose. Full bodied with an viscous, chewy mouthfeel. Sweet, rich chocolate cake batter on the palate with warming booze, vanilla, and coffee. Finishes intensely rich with boozy chocolate and coffee."
3755,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.61,"Bottle at brewery. Ruby hued body with a sudsy, quickly dissipating pale pink head. Smells exactly like a fresh picked raspberry crushed between the fingers. Taste is like a raspberry with the sweetness mostly sucked out of it: the tartness from the natural innoculation complements the inherent raspberry tartness very well. Medium bodied with a lingering fruity character. Complex and elegant  93/100"
3756,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.75,"Even though I had to fly to Boston, and drive to Canton - DDH Fort Point was well worth it. It's funny because I really, really enjoy the base beer - Fort Point - and had badly wanted DDH Fort Point for some time... but when I planned my trip to Boston, I didn't think about that one particular beer at all. I'd hoped that Tree House might have a special release or something, but didn't give Trillium a second though. Lo and behold, I ended up getting bottles and cans of several Permutations - and finally had the joy of DDH Fort Point on tap. The beer pours beautiful, a nice yellow-gold with a clean white head. It smells richly of citrus. I couldn't believe how free of bitterness it was - just a bit of light dryness, and tons of juice. I've occasionally scoffed at DDH beers that just don't seem any better than the base... this is not one of those beers. DDH Fort Point was absolutely worth the wait. My only lament is that it was not available in cans!"

3758,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.34,"2014 vintage; drank 6/22/19 @ Golgi Apparatus.  Very raspberry forward, especially in the nose but also on the tongue; honeyed wheat & a pleasant tartness as well. I prefer just the straight up geueze, but as far as fruited varieties go, this is way up there. Hopefully I'll get to try another someday..."
3759,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.78,"Oh. my goodness. Pours a clear dark brown with immediate aromas of roasted nuts, toffee, and spice. Mouthfeel is warm and rich, but refreshingly smooth. Taste is bright nutmeg and cinnamon with a chocolate and caramel finish. A light burst of chili in the aftertaste that's not overpowering and ends in a pleasant puff of cocoa notes. A pleasure on its own in a snifter. Top a tequila old fashioned with this for a real treat."
3760,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.75,"On tap at Casey. White head. Golden yellow color.  So much tart, juicy peaches. Wow, so dominant. Some acidity. Tart and sour. Easy drinking for the abv.  Very drinkable. Glad I got to try it on tap."
3761,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.71,This...is...terrific... Plain and simple...  Nailed the aromas and flavors of a big fudgy German chocolate cake... lots of coconut and dark chocolate... very very tasty... No booze... World class
3762,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.68,"2016 vintage. A: Pours pitch black with a thin medium brown head that fizzles out quickly. S: Heavenly dark cocoa with coconut, a bit of vanilla bean and nuts, cardamom, and moderate bourbon. Like an insanely good bourbon-soaked chocolate bar.  T: Rich melted dark chocolate, moderate toasted coconut, cola, and very light roast and coffee with medium-light sweetness. The taste sits on the palate for a good long while. M: Thick, mouth coating, and a bit sticky. Full body with medium carbonation. Mild alcohol warmth. O: Really delicious with an insanely good aroma. Flavors are extremely well integrated. The coconut still pops after over 6 months."
3763,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.44,"16 oz. can dated 3/21/19. Nice and fresh. Poured into Aslin anniversary glass. L: Nice 2F white pillowy head with good retention and a cap and ring. Beer is a hazy golden orange. S: Grapefruit and pineapple and peach predominate. A little bit of grass/earth. T: Pretty much follows nose, citrus a bit ahead of the tropical fruits. A bit bready and grassy with a fairly neutral finish. F: Light bodied, moderate to full carbonation for nice drying. The usual solid effort on construction and balance from Trillium. O: Drinks very, very well. Gotta love it."
3764,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.51,"12oz. can into a Founder's snifter. Shared with schen9303.  Pours super dark for the style. A bold mahogany. No head. Sticky, oily, lace that really hangs around. Nose is loads of molasses, oak, booze, and vanilla. I also get anise, brown sugar, and caramel. Very dense and aromatic. Beer opens vanilla, caramel, and molasses. Oak and tobacco in the middle while the sweetness continues to heighten. More molasses, anise, booze, and brown sugar at the end with a sticky, lingering finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Rich and oily on the palate and goes down smooth, rich, and hot. Lingering aftertaste that sticks around for days.  This beer's worth the hype. Really solid overall and made to drink now! Doesn't need any aging."
3765,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.5,"Pours pitch black with a dark tan head. Fits the style perfectly, IMHO. The nose is led by the bourbon, but it’s surprisingly not too hot, and there’s a really nice vanilla note to accompany the dark chocolate and char notes, and there’s maybe a smidge of coconut. Dark chocolate leads the taste, accompanied by the bourbon, and balanced by the vanilla and a more substantial coconut flavor. This is hefty and brawny, yet also well balanced, something that requires a lot of skill from the brewery in my experience. Prairie definitely has that skill set. The mouthfeel is rich and slightly creamy, well suited to the beer. I really liked the base beer - a LOT - and this is better, IMHO. World class stuff here."
3766,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.53,"Batch 8 poured in Casey teku. Pours a bright vibrant clear ruby red with a soft whispy pink head. Nose has that mellow Greek yogurt smell going on with a blast of tart and sweet raspberries and cherries. First sip is a little of everything. Tart, mellow funk, musty, jammy! I love the depth and intensity of the raspberries. It’s definitely jam like, perfect tart to sweet ratio as far as the berries go. Nice mellow wet oak throughout that really ties it together. Musty cellar like quality and mild yogurt funk all come together to make this beer what it is. As it warms the raspberries shine even more and tartness builds but this beer is equally interesting on both the colder and warmer side. Body is medium to Jammy at times. Tart funky dry finish at the end that invites another swig to wet the mouth and start the process all over again."
3767,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.27,"Had the 2016 bottle Look was nice dark with lots of coconut floating in it. Flakes were pretty big. Smell is bourbon and chocolate and coconut. Taste was mostly coconut. Nice mouth feel as well, pretty thick and boozy. Chocolate notes on the back end of the taste as well."
3768,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.5,"Brew: Hair Of The Dog Brewing Company / Brewery And Tasting Room – Adam From the Wood Intro: 12 oz. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.  Appearance: Murky dark brown, almost opaque. Minimal to no head. Same with the lacing as we drank Smell: Sweet, heavy, dark, bourbon. Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Again, a mixture of dark fruits, pretty heavy tasting. Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy. Invokes seriousness. Oily mouth coating Drink: Again, follows along with mouthfeel. I’ve had better and I’ve had much worse. It’s definitely a sipper Conclusion: I’ve had several other old ales and this would not be in my top ten. It is very well crafted and is deserving of it’s place in the category. It just gives me the impression of old school. This was the second of two drinks from HOTD and both seem very similar although different styles. It just leaves me with the impression of a brewing company doing what they do and perfecting it. It may be time to move ahead"
3769,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.23,"(2021) Looks like a day-old Dr. Pepper that’s gone flat but with a whift of bubbles on the rim and slight random streaks of white foam on the surface. Smells like faint brandy. The taste is where this stands out and distinguishes itself from other barleywines. Very rich dark fruits and barleywine and bourbon barrel. Charred oak, sweet fig, tobacco, vanilla, raisin, sweet toffee, dates. No off-putting flavors or alcohol characteristics of bad barley wines. Fantastically thick viscosity compliments the taste. This is a ten out of ten for the style. Nearly perfect blending of beer and alcohol."
3770,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.44,"Bottled 9.21.16, almost a year old. Poured from a 500mL bottle into a hill farmstead tulip. Purchased at the brewery.  Pours a deep brown body with a nice, frothy three finger heads that reduces to a ring of foam and leaves spotty lacing.  Aromas are very inviting, sweet bourbon, coffee, milk chocolate, honey, sweet vanilla. On the tongue it's pretty sweet, caramel and sweet milk chocolate, developing into vanilla and bourbon, chocolate cake, coffee. The finish is roasty and charred, a lightly bitter coffee / toasted malt flavor that sticks on the tongue for a while. Mouthfeel is rich but not too thick, sweet and decadent. Medium-low carbonation. A real winner from Hill Farmstead. This release is drinking great, complex yet balanced with tons of flavor and a good bourbon presence."
3771,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.62,"Pours a cloudy, deep, dark ruby red coloration with a tiny, fizzy head that fades to nothing almost instantly. Smells absolutely intoxicating of vibrant, tart red berries and musty, old oak, with just a hint of tannins and vinegar coming through as well. Taste is a perfect balance of juicy, vibrant, sweet and tart red berry notes of cherry, raspberry and cranberry, with each really standing out on their own, and a strong barrel-character of earthy, old and slightly tannic oak, as well as some light, musty mushroom funk and just a hint of balsamic vinegar. Finishes quite tart, but not overwhelmingly so, with some vibrant red berries, musty oak and a touch of tannins and vinegar lingering in the aftertaste. Full, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/strong carbonation. A fantastic Flanders Red Ale that just showcases a perfect marriage of vibrant, fresh fruit and musty, old oak, with a perfect balance of sweet and tart notes and a wonderful richness and complexity added by some lighter, vinous, funky and acidic notes that all come together to form a sublime drinking experience. Also stands heads and shoulders above the way too sweet and one-dimensional Rodenbach Alexander thanks to a much richer and more well-balanced depth of flavor."
3772,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.0,"An excellent, excellent beer but, for my taste, not as good as most ratings. I'm NOT slamming this beer at all; I'm just saying that there are many of this style that are more balanced and generally more drinkable."
3773,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.45,look is juicy orange haze
3774,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.88,Some folks prefer St. Bernardus Abt 12 and it's hard to argue with that. But for my money the best quad is Trappistes Rochefort 10. It never fails to impress or satisfy. Definitely a desert island beer
3775,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.38,"Canned on: 12/8/17. Opened on 12/9/17 Update review ** canned on 7/9/18. Orange tinted gold coloration, muddy body, opaque depth, with a puffy white cloud of foam recedes slow. A bit of scattered coverage is left over with nice lace. The nose is very powerful. Pungent citrus , wild honey pie, starfruit and herbs with a fruity, tropical blend and black pepper from the rather excellent Galaxy hop strain. Tangerine, pineapple and sweet red fruits all blend together harmoniously.  This is easily the most, tropical and citrus fruity hop flavor from a Pale Ale I've ever had. New England style...but not an IPA. just pale. It's like a pale ale, blended with tropical punch and o.j. mix in some earthy herbs and husky wheat finished off with black pepper. A nice citrus bite brings in a juicy feel, thick body and a slightly dry, earthy toned finish. Rather extreme in it's hoppy complexity and off the charts juicy style. The light wheat and golden style malt allows for maximum hop effect but still has some fine flavor's as well. ** the clean feel and APA style flavor approach from such a thick looking body is pretty amazing. It's reasonable to say this is the most complex hoppy flavor from any straight pale ale I can think of.  Galaxy is a very versatile hop, one of my all time favorites, although My specialty is the old world, European strain, Galaxy seems to bring in huge fruitiness but with plenty of old earthy tones as well. At 6.6 % abv, massive hoppiness this could easily be mistaken for an IPA. The body is thick, smooth but juicy.llI think of pale ale's to have a cleaner malty body. The hops totally dominates although tge malt is nice...lfor an IPA! Regardless, this is ""what's hot"" in the beer (geek) world right nowl New England styles. Don't get me wrong, the hop complexity is mindblowing, but the balance for a Pale Ale is questionable.  Overall, high quality. Dense complexity in the hop, easy to drink, relentless hoppy flavor. The malt is also very tasty and unique just a bit off kilter in balance for tge style. But who reviews or rates a beer just on style guidlines these days, anyway??"
3776,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.23,"Hazy neon yellow body, white cap. Smell is huge with the pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and orange, but there is also lemon, lime, and melon in there too, dry hops finish. Such a huge nose I expected the taste to come down a notch, but honestly it did a lot, still fruity and good, verging on sweet, hops are very light. A good neipa taste but nothing crazy. Feel is bright and light while being very juicy, yet finishes drier, hop textures are soft but intentional. Much prefer the original"

3779,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.52,"Bottle into a tasting glass, reviewed from notes. Thanks Aaron! A: Hazy deep gold body under a finger of white froth. Mediocre retention and lacing, which is better than I expected for the style. Pretty nice. S: Intense. Huge citric acidity is front and center, with waves of lemon, lime, grapeskin, and passionfruit. Some sweeter grape and melon notes emerge as it warms, as well as more than a hint of vanilla oak. Excellent. T: Even better than the nose, with immense flavor and complexity without any loss of balance. Sour fruitiness up front, rich oak underneath, and a long, tart, drying finish with a lovely vinous aftertaste. Wow. M: Substantial body with light, soft carbonation. Lively enough to keep it from being the least bit sticky, but not too prickly. Solid. O: Amazing beer, and probably my favorite Side Project to date. Huge thanks to Aaron for hosting the share with this and so many other wonderful brews. Cheers!"
3780,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.5,2018 version poured into a snifter. The peppers are not overpowering but do provide some heat in the finish. Cinnamon is very up front in aroma. I don't typically seek out beers that contain peppers but this is pretty tasty.
3781,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.63,"Pours black and viscous, more like a syrup than a brew! A thin brown head quickly dissipates into thin ring around the glass. On the nose, cinnamon, bourbon barrel, and dark roast malts. On the palate, lots of cinnamon on the front followed by anise, bourbon, and char. Silky smooth mouthfeel enhanced by lack of carbonation. Overall, the finest example of an oatmeal stout I’ve ever had."
3782,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.45,"Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA"
3783,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.39,"Straw with a hint of haze, moderate to few large, fast rising bubbles, and a fast dissipating white foam. Smells really funky, sour, lambic like with oak notes and dusty cellars. Reminds me of Cantillon brewery in Brussels. Some white wine, and yellow stone fruit. Sour with no sweetness, macaroni, oak notes, sour yellow plums, lemon juice, gravel, and dusty cellar. A hint of dull bitterness as well. Medium, sour, acidic body with moderate to low carbonation. Tart, dry finish. I got this in Santa Rosa at Russian River's original brewhouse, and am drinking it in Redding, Feb 4th, 2018. Excellent brew!"
3784,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.46,"Look is classic stout - poured with an opaque head left minimal lacing. Nose is of chocolate, roasted malts/coffee, maple syrup. Taste follows the nose. Very, very well balanced between roasted malts, maple syrup. additionally, get notes of coffee and bakers chocolate. Feel has a good viscosity. Coats the tounge but leaves the pallet easily. Overall, excellent stout. This is what I wish stouts were moving towards - not something cloyingly sweet. Taste would be near perfect if I was able to get barrel."
3785,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.78,"Appearance - pours super clear golden color with a nice fluffy white head great retention. Few spotty sheets of lacing. Aroma - Lemon, light floral, yeast, light cracker, light spiciness very delicate nose. Taste - Taste follows nose closely lots of lemon and citrus peel. Yeast, light floral flavors not quite as spicy as the nose pet on. Feel - Soft, nice carbonation prickly at first. great dry finish. Overall - Really well done soft flavors are very subtle."
3786,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,3.47,"Diabetes in a Bomber, Schedule you dialysis appt. before you drink this. Way, way too sweet, if like myself, you like B.A stouts that pours like 50W motor in January. If I had to use two words....Pixie Stick"
3787,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.48,"SURLY ABRASIVE DIPA 4/26/21 Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Samuel Smith English tulip. a: Translucent orange with an inch thick white head which receded to thick surface foam and dense lacing. s: Dank tropical fruit. t: Follows the nose with a moderate hop bite and dry finish. m: Denser side of medium, very good body and some carbonation tingle. o: A near the top of the top 250 brew years ago, now available in my state. Great flavor presaging the coming of the NE style. Not as fruity but with more tropical danky goodness than most of the best of the old West Coast style entries."
3788,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.34,A: deep black to chocolate the best fit creamy small white bubbles Caramell to Brown’s head frothy like a cuppa coffee that’s been blended with an immersion blender  S: Literally smells like everything on the label I get maple I get sweet cocoa I want some hints of coconut Chili’s subtle spice dark chocolate hot chocolate T: Spicy hot chocolate creamy melted chocolate called in the refrigerator for an hour and 23 minutes F: Really soft really creamy very light the only thing that it could be a little bit thicker it’s a little bit watery but otherwise lovely great finish awesome aftertaste of that light hinted space lots of chocolate lots of O: do you have a delightful barrel aged this is probably out rages Lee insane
3789,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.67,"Bottle 3 of 4. Finally getting down to reviewing this legendary brew. Cork and cage 750 ml bottle and cost was a mere $8.70 CDN. Probably should've picked up another half dozen of these. A fine way to conclude Canada Day! Served cold into a chalice. Appearance - Light pink or red in color. Capped with a tiny off white head. Good clarity. Looks the way its expected too. Smell - Tart... very tart with raspberry and cheery and of course some balsamic vinegar, but this is a more robust fruitiness than Grand Cru. Very inviting. Taste - First sip was loads of tart raspberries, second was all cranberry. Followed up with plenty of cherries. Wondrous. Tart yet sweet, significantly more so than Grand Cru. Booze is an afterthought yet its packing 7% in there an its completely invisible. Oak shows up after a touch of warming and just adds to the complexity. Mouthfeel - Dry, juicy, tart, crisp, effervescent, smooth. Each sip seems a little different and a little more magical. Hard to pin down but excellent. Tingly sensation on by tongue has me singing for joy. What gets me is how deliciously easy this is to drink. after every single sip, I just want more. Overall - Simply put one of the best best beers on the planet, although it might not even be favorite (or second favorite- Grand Cru and 2013 Vintage ales were sublime too.) by the kings of the Flanders Ale. Somehow this is impossible given that I've just scored it in my top top 5 beers of all time at the moment. Just a wonderful array of cherries, raspberries and cranberries with plenty of tartness, sourness to boot. Happy Canada Day to me indeed!"
3790,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.18,"Dark brown with a garnet hue. Thin head quickly settles into a tan crown with zero lacing. Strong coffee in the nose with some clear cinnamon behind. The taste is all about the cinnamon though. It’s not at insane levels, but it’s definitely the first and last thing you taste, with some coffee, roasted malts, licorice and bourbon flavors playing a supporting role. Relatively full bodied and creamy, while maintaining a definite slickness. Fun to try, and the coffee addition is very nice, but I prefer the regular B-Bomb."
3791,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.66,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker pint  Look: Opaque peach juice with a thick white head.  Smell: Fantastic. Mango, peach, guava, and papaya. All hops.  Taste: A big wallop of green mango and peach up front then mellows out to a sweet malt body with guava notes and finishes clean and juicy.  Feel: Big bodied but still quenching. They got the hazy body perfect on this one. No bitterness. Slight alcohol. Soft carbonation.  Overall: They nailed just about every aspect of this hazy IPA. Outstanding."
3792,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.29,"Out of the bottle at Westvletern, Belgium. It has happened: man has landed on the moon, Lindbergh flew around the world, and Raul has finally had Westvleteren 12. It feels like I have committed a crime but won’t be caught. Something unearthly is happening here… Like Shawn Kemp using a rubber or something. I’m gone and I may not want to be found."
3793,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.36,"Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a very thin carbonated head that goes away almost instantly. There is no head retention or lacing. Big sour aroma with wine and a lot of dark fruits. Big sour taste. Wine, raisins, plums. Medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation."
3794,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.58,"Grapes, white wine and a little funkiness to the aroma. A little more sourness to the taste up front with the dry, tart grapes shining in the finish. Great beer overall, grapes were really well done and complimenting."

3796,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.6,"Beautiful hazy dark orange, with a creamy white head, tiny dotted lacing. The nose is full of hop, orange and funk, pungent pith and peach. Flavor is softer, opening bright and closing gentle. Superb."
3797,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.15,Hazy strawberry color with thin lacing. Tart raspberry funk on the nose. Taste is tart funk raspberry with alot of puckering. The sourness coats the mouth to the point where you have to scrape your tongue. Very funky and very tart.
3798,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.43,"Clear straw and slightly golden with a little carbonation and no real head. Smells of Fresh grain, malt, sour"
3799,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,5.0,"Poured from a bottle. Motor oil look and pour. Coconut fat floating on top. Smell is coconut, chocolate, vanilla, barrel, amazing. Taste is all of that, plus adding that perfect thick and chewy mouthfeel, you get the perfect beer."
3800,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.5,White head. Hazy yellow color. Tons of nectarines. Very fruity. Peachy. Lemon acidity. Light vinegar. Some funk. Mostly sour. Light bodied. Nice carbonation. So much fruit. Very awesome sour. Well done.

3802,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.43,"Sweet tropical hoppy, bready-malty, and hint of tropical dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a sweet malty and mosaic dank finish...some sweet floral berry notes pop up as it warms. This is juicy-soft on the palate...really good!"
3803,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.84,Poured a pitch black. Small amount of mocha head. Smells incredible with lots of bourbon but not overpowering. Taste is complex and nuanced probably due to the extended time in the barrel and it lasts a long time after finishing a sip. Feel is very smooth and coats the mouth. Overall a standout non-adjunct barrel aged stout.
3804,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.74,"Huge beer! 2014 version. Pours jet black with minimal head. Aroma is lots of raisin and dates, caramel and bourbon. Hides ridiculous high abv very well. Only a slight hint of booziness. Lots of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, almost a little cherry, cocoa. Awesome, complex huge beer."

3806,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.48,"Sadly, I neglected to note the batch number - I shared this bottle with friends and bar staff at Barrel Theory in St. Paul. The bottle gushed every so slightly, but showed no signs of being infected. The nose is lightly sour, while the taste is light, mildly sour, yeasty, clean, and very drinkable. It's a beautiful gold-yellow in color with a light, crisp head. I wish I'd drank this by myself - it's a delicious beer!"
3807,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.0,Certainly not a bad beer but I find Barleywines too sweet for my liking and this one was no different. I also didn’t notice a massive difference between this and other barleywines from local brewers
3808,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.54,L -- Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy straw body with practically no head produced with even a well aerated pour. Looks like cider 
3809,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.52,"Thick pour, fizzy, head fades super fast, no lacing, and pitch black. Strong aromas of bourbon, chocolate, and coconut. Notes of chocolate candy, bourbon, barrel, coconut, vanilla and chocolate liquor. Thick, smooth, no heat. Extremely solid stout with great flavors and perfect balance."

3811,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.68,"Pours black. Nice brown head. Two fingers. Fades slowly with light lacing. Aroma is awesome. Deep dark chocolate, molasses, coffee grinds and brown sugar. Taste is great too. Follows the nose. Deep chocolate fudge, coffee grinds and dark fruits. Another awesome stout from evil twin. Huge fan of their stouts."
3812,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.94,"Poured from bottle to a tulip.  Pours pitch black, thick and oily. Looks heavy and thick. Pieces of coconut floating in the glass. Aroma is straight chocolate cake with subtle notes of coconut. Flavor is exactly as expected...rich chocolate cake and coconut. Absolutely decadent. Dessert beer at it's finest. Drinks thick....coats the mouth for sure.  This beer just does it for me. Likely one of the best non BA imperial stouts I've ever tasted. Just amazing."
3813,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,5.0,"On tap at the Bruery. Poured into a Bruery tulip. They hype is real on this one. Pours pitch black. The smell is great, vanilla, bourbon, charred wood, that Bruery sweetness. The taste mimics the smell. The feel is smooth viscous and my word does it ever hide that 20% alcohol. One of the best out there."
3814,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.84,"A - A dark orange body, with a slightly reddish tinge. Short white head, persistent, with small-bubbled lacing. S - The nose is bright fruit, citrus in the form of orange and grapefruit, peach and tropical fruits like mango and pineapple. T - The flavor follows, with orange juice and peach flesh front and center, mango and banana notes, and a hint of pith in the finish.  M - The feel is lush but clean, with a dry close. O - One of the finest IPAs out there. It offers great smells, amazing flavors. Superb."
3815,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.47,"Look is a traditional porter, black with a tan head that leaves minimal lacing. Nose is all expected, coffee, cinnamon, and maple syrup. Get some bakers chocolate as well. Taste follows the nose. Feel is luscious, but not oil thick. Overall, a great porter! Sweet aspects that do not become cloying"
3816,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.11,"Aroma is slightly burnt dark malts and big bourbon. The flavor is bourbon, dark/roasted malts, a hint of maple syrup and a warming alcoholic/acidic finish."
3817,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.49,Had on tap. Just a luscious and delicious dipa. And extremely drinkable too! That 12 percent is dangerously unnoticeable amongst floral and citrus hops and the hazy and bready backbone of the beer. Just bursts off the palate
3818,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,3.44,"Not anything I want to try again, just not my cup of tea and if you put any other label on this beer besides ""side Project"" it would fall into the Tart of Darkness category. Happy to tick but nothing to write home about. sorry bruh"
3819,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,3.88,"Canned 6/5/17; drank 7/20/17 @ the Yarchives.  Opaque orange/yellow appearance.  A rough pour yielded a big, bright white head; decent lace.  Dry wheat, orange citrus & faint yeast notes in the nose.  Soft, medium mouthfeel.  Mild orange citrus & peanut butter flavors up front; wheat & mild clove notes on the finish. No booze heat.  Not the fruit-forward juice bomb I want in the style; this is pleasant but ultimately forgettable."
3820,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.74,"One of the most unique wild's I've ever had. It is black, and it is wildly acidic and flavor packed. Flavor had a lot of oak, molasses, raisin, chocolate, sour cherry, and spice, and a perfect bourbon balance without being boozy ... didn't detect the vanilla. The nose follows the palate with the sour cherry really coming through, and the vanilla making its appearance. The mouth feel is what really stands out with this beer, amazingly thick syrupy smooth and long lasting with flavor on the finish. Amazing wild, amazingly unique! Must try!"
3821,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.64,"Look: pitch black, thick mocha head, small bubbles Smell: big chocolate, chili, malt Taste: Super strong chocolate flavor, nice malt, and you get the kick of chili at the end Feel: viscous, heavy Overall: really interesting, straddles the line between a dessert beer and a imperial stout"
3822,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.98,"Opened for no good reason other than to have a fresh tasting. Poured cellar temp, moderately fast to a tulip glass. Color is menacing, deep, dark, opaque brown/black. Forget about any head. This stuff comes out thick like oil, leaving a heavy trail on the glass as it’s moved. Nose is very sweet vanilla, with a mix of subtle coconut. First sips are heavy on the vanilla, not cloying, seemingly balanced by the coconut and heavy malt foundation. The bourbon is aromatic with your nose in the glass, brings a tiny harmonic presence in the sip, but then really comes to roost once the sip is gone. I’m nursing these sips, considering the absurd price point, but a mouth full puts the whole symphony into action. The mouthfeel is extremely thick, which I always enjoy, though I deducted a small amount, wondering if a little lighter might have opened up the profile more...it could just as easily be a 5. The alcohol has no bite whatsoever; totally smooth at all points. It’s so thick and bombastic, I could see pouring this over some fresh whole bean vanilla ice cream. Oh, that would be good on a hot night like tonight. This is usually a cold, dead of winter type beer for me, but I needed to try it fresh, lesson learned from my BA Ten Fidy experience. I only consumed half the bottle, leaving some to enjoy tomorrow...if I can hold out. It’s a beast to be sure, not an every day drink, but a nice first-world luxury. For the per ounce price point, Utopias might be the more complex, refined, and charactered beverage, but if I spend this much on beer again, the missus might not be so forgiving. I’ll call myself “blessed” and move on."

3825,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,2.65,"16oz can, dated 9/6/19 (I think, the first digit is smudged. Happens when you dat eon the shoulder of the can instead of the bottom) poured into 14oz teku. Poured the expected and typical solid black color, with 1/4 inch of light brown head that had low retention and lacing. The aroma was all coffee. Full on burnt Folgers. No maple scent, and no beer aromas either. Pretty similar on the tongue, with the maple showing up at the finish. There was also a noticeable alcohol hotness that lingered on the back of the palate. The body was well thinner than I anticipated, and thinner than the vast majority of big stouts. The beer did manage only a semi-sweet finish, I was expecting a Grape Lotion dye-a-beeetus inducing amount of sweetness. Drinkability will depend on your level of coffee tolerance; I can handle it as a supporting flavor, but when it completely dominates the beer, well, I coulda just gone to Starbucks. Overall, not only is this beer not my jam, I don't think it's good at what it's trying to be. As always, YMMV."

3827,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.43,"This one just checks off all the boxes for me. The profile and body of this beer is fantastic and as cliché as it sounds, this just one dang good beer. Fabulous IPA!"
3828,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.54,"Smells like delicious pancakes. Tastes complex and intriguing, with hints of coffee and maple. Really smooth and creamy. If I changed anything, it would be more maple and less coffee, but then, I LOVE sweet stuff. Overall a great beer!"
3829,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.6,"Cellared bottle. Black with brown shading, edging, and cap. The coffee takes this to the next level in both smell and taste. Smell features the coffee with bourbon, bigger oak, dark chocolate, oat, and black strap molasses. Taste is right up there for best oatmeal stouts: take everything from the nose and add char, raisin, toasted caramel, soil and vanillins. Not sweet or coffee bomb or booze to the face, just a melded oatmeal stout with great layers of flavor with a rustic and classic feel that stay decently light through the sip, great characteristic finish with oat froth and dryness"
3830,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.58,"Pours a hazy golden color with pure white head. Aroma is lots of tropical fruit. Flavor follows the nose with big notes of papaya, mango and citrus. Has a bit of bitterness on the back end with a clean citrus peel aftertaste. Has a nice drinkable body and overall very delicious."
3831,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.38,"16 oz can traded from egrandfield, dated 3/19/19 poured into Rogue IPA glass.  The deepest, murkiest pour I've seen in awhile. Love it. Tall, fluffy, creamy cap of white standing about 3 fingers, receding to 1 and leaving tons of creamy lace behind.  Aroma brings a lot of alcohol heat, but more importantly - tons of juicy citrus fruit - grapefruits, oranges, sweet lemon juice and tangerine; some pineapple and mango and papaya; slight dank stickiness.  Flavor is just huge - tons of papaya and mango with following fruits of grapefruit, tangerine, and orange. My can has a bit more alcohol heat than I'd like, it burns the flavors a bit; it finishes on grass and lime.  Feel is juicy with spikey carbonation that dances around and stabs the tongue and forms into a nice popping creaminess on the back. Lots of alcohol heat. Moderate resins on the finish.  Overall, if they can hide the heat a little better, this beer would be in my top 20 easily. Really good stuff, amazing as always from Trillium. Really glad I got to try this."
3832,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.59,"Prepping for a wedding, hopefully this is a good luck charm. A- Tallboy pours into a tall chalice with a black as the midnight sky body and a very, very dark cocoa powder hue to the cap. The crown shoots up to an inch high with very good retention and a thick, frothy-foamy texture. Thick coral-esque webs of lacing. S- Cocoa, cocoa, cocoa. Rich, bitter and semi-sweet chocolate dominates the aroma alongside some of the other roasty things like the charred barley and some dark roast coffee beans. Chocolate syrup, sweet milk chocolate bars, fudge, slight dark fruits, milk and cookies, fruity very dark chocolate and a hint of toasted nuts. T- The sweetness makes a bit of a difference here as things shift more towards a rich, semi-dark milk chocolate bar type of flavor alongside that chocolate syrup and less of the bitter dark chocolate bars and baking cocoa. Rather sweet but still balanced by the coffee, chocolate and roast malt bitterness. Toffee, caramel, chocolate milk, malted milk balls, roast barley, chocolate malt, toasted nuts, fudge, chocolate truffles and cookies come to mind. Extremely rich for the ABV. MF- Again and again Tree House dominates mouthfeel. Thick, luscious and heavy with a high level of carbonation that creams up beautifully on the palate. A touch bitter in the finish but a lot of sweetness to counteract that. There is actually a fairly strong amount of coffee in the flavor but wow does the cocoa shine in this beer. It is about as far as you can take chocolate in a beer before it becomes too much with wonderful sweet milk chocolate, fudge, fruity dark chocolate and cocoa nib flavors. A 6.5% dessert that packs about as much flavor as it possibly could."
3833,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.56,"Can poured into fluted snifter. Brown with slightly translucent edges of mahogany when held up to the light. Thick, slow to bubble out head, tan and foamy. Aroma is dark fruit, caramel, toffee, vanilla, dark roasted grain, booze. Flavor is sweet syrupy toffee, rich layers of dark fruits including prunes, raisins over deep malt, vanilla, wood, booze. Moderate carbonation, syrupy thick, sweet and full bodied. Excellent use of the barrel to enhance the big flavors. Booze smoothed out into rich and complex flavors instead of heat."
3834,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.15,Bottle. Garnet pour with a white head. Big raspberry bouquet. Tasty with loads of raspberry highlights. Nice caramel malt and oak backbeats. Good body and mouthfeel.
3835,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.77,"#248 of Top 250 - 2020 Bottle L: Jet black, dark tan head that dissipates quickly S: Lots of coconut, some booze, strong wafts of chocolate T: Sweet, per the usual with Angry Chair, but surprisingly well blended adjunct flavors. Coconut and cinnamon up front, some chocolate on the back end. Really enjoyable F: It should come as no surprise that this is very thicc O: Glad to have finally tried it, one of the best offerings from AC. A top tier pastry stout"
3836,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.48,"Pours a fully turbid, almost glowing deep apricot orange, sitting like apricot purée in the glass. A finger of creamy white head sits atop, receding to a full collar.  Nose: The Julius lineage is evident. Ripe juicy orange, mandarin, grapefruit, pomello, orange zest, grapefruit pith, super ripe mango, pineapple, kiwifruit, a touch of melon, a hint of orange creamsicle, and that signature Tree House pink bubblegum note. Sweet, ripe, incredibly citrusy, and saturated. Palate: King Jjjuliusss greets the palate with an instant burst of all that citrus goodness. Orange, grapefruit, and mandarin. Pulpy and juicy, but not without some nice zesty and pithy characteristics. Plenty of ripe tropical notes with pineapple, mango, a touch of papaya, and some ripe apricot. There's a subtle grassy impression beneath the fruity notes, along with this thin dank thread that I can only describe as...well, cannabis. The tropical notes meld together, lending a rainbow sherbet flavour, before just a hint of that King Julius orange cream note peeks through. The finish boasts big pithy notes or orange and grapefruit, a touch of grassiness, even a hint of pine, and dries our really nicely, showing some clean base malt. Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is fluffy, plush, and velvety, definitely pushing it into full-bodied territory. About as soft and fluffy of a beer as Tree House has made. Despite its softness, it remains fluid, drinkable, and even a bit crisp. Incredibly balanced while still delivering that plush New England feel. Effervescence is moderate, soft, and adequate. Malt is mildly sweet at first, drying out nicely.  Overall: One of the highest rated beers, and one of the most respected in the lineup of one of the most respected breweries. There's a lot riding on this one. I don't think it's the ""10th best beer in the world"", but if you only drank NEIPAs, I could see this being the gold standard. It is without question one of the very best Citra-driven New England IPAs I've ever had. It's different from King Julius, and i think that's the point. I do prefer the intense orange-creamsicle character of KJ to this, but this is also arguably more complex. At the end of the day, it's still arguably *one of* the best New England IPAs I've had, and that will do."
3837,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,3.68,"I've been on and off with mosaic for a few years now - I'm a fan of how soft it makes a beer, and Fort Point is no exception. This beer also exemplifies the mosaic effect - it's quite green and grassy, and while that's great, I am not sure that I get the hype. The beer is quite drinkable and tasty, but it's certainly no Citra-hopping."
3838,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.49,"very nice stout----a nice balance of baker's chocolate (not sweet) and coconut.... medium body, not at all thin, with faint sweetness but more toward the bitter--which is awesome, I don't like overly sweet stouts..... well balanced, with a long finish....really well-made and very quaffable for a stout!"
3839,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,3.69,"Pouring a 2017 bottle from a 750 ml. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer, just like Black Tuesday, pours out way lighter in color than expected when pouring a stout of this nature. Medium-dark brown color with highlights all the way through. On the pour, as quick as bubbles could form they would pop. Eventually the carbonation got ahead of the disippation and formed a thinner light tan crown. The smell is quite demanding and confident with booze and alcohol. It burns the nostrils and honestly doesn't leave much else to show you along the way. The taste comes in more inviting, showing you smooth chocolate and vanilla, while still having a rather pronounced burn. I do enjoy the thickness of the body to these but I will say that I wish this and Black Tuesday were both more complex. They really aren't blowing me away. I get it, it's impressive they made a 20% stout blah blah blah, but I still want it to have complexity and blow me away. And these just haven't been."
3840,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.8,"The beer smells of bourbon, wood, bakers chocolate, raisins, and tobacco. It tastes of chocolate fudge, licorice, char, molasses, and powerful bourbon barrel. The beer is rich, with some drinkability."
3841,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.75,"Pours a beautiful golden - surprising clarity, I'd expected more yeast suspension. Immediately after popping the cap, apricot permeated the air - it has a tremendous nose, clean and tart and fruity. The taste follows suit - tart, sour, full of apricots. Rich, yet not the yeasty beast that I had anticipated. Finish is fairly clean as well, which is surprised me a bit. This is quite likely one of my top 3 beers from Side Project at this point - I'd gladly trade for more any day!"
3842,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.0,"Reviewed from notes. Purchased on 12/27/19 at Jungle Jim's in Cincinnati. Reviewed on 1/4/20. Poured from the stubby 12 oz. bottle into an El Catador teku glass. A: Modestly hazy nice gold, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Forms a half-finger of white head that lasts well. S: Melon and resin and herbal. Cracker malts and citrus rind. Maybe a little stone fruits as well. Nice, but not huge for a DIPA. T: Resin and melon, citrus pith and dank. Cracker malt sweetness. Orange rind and melon rind bitterness with some ethanol sweetness at the end. M: Medium body, average carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable but generally well-hidden for a DIPA – thought the ABV listed isn’t big for a DIPA either. O: A good beer, but I'm not buying the hype. Or at least not as good as I hoped, or perhaps a batch that doesn't live up to historical achievements. But I’d buy it without hesitation on a rotating basis if it was available around here. It’s not a juicy NE IPA, it's maltier than (and not as bitter as) a typical West Coast IPA."
3843,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.6,"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was dark brown color with a slim one finger white to slight off white somewhat foamy head that dissipated within a light lacing. The smell was full of sweet darkened caramel boozy malt. The taste had a full boozy sweet caramel malty flavor. There is a slight boozy sweet caramel aftertaste that lead to sweet yet dry finish. On the palate, this sat about a medium to heavy on the body. I don’t mind the thickness on this beer - it’s a barleywine, it’s supposed to be this way. Boy, does this super smooth over my tongue. Overall, well, Gabe Fletcher, yeah dude, you knocked this one outa the park."
3844,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.75,Excellent! On tap at brewery. Not boozy at all even at 15%abv. Taste lingers which is a good thing. Vanilla with a small bit of rye and whiskey in the perfect balance.
3845,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.19,"On draft, 16 oz. pour. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2inch head. Smell is full of pine, citrus. Taste is piney, malts and citrus are present, significant bitterness. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall if you get a chance to try this beer, do it."
3846,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.35,**
3847,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.38,"2017 vintage. Poured from fridge temp and allowed to warm. Pours a beautiful yellow with quickly dissipating white head. No sediment in the bottle. Nose is insane. A huge burst of citrus smacks you in the face. Lemon and orange primarily. A bit of pine, wheat, funk, and tartness. I can tell that this is going to be sour. Taste is as expected. Sour upfront, with a bitterness on the back end. Citrus peel really comes through, with a really nice earthy taste that runs throughout. Pine and a bit of leather are present. Mouthfeel is dry with good carbonation. Overall, a really nice example of the style. They always compete with the best."
3848,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.32,"Found this dusty on a shelf in my local deli, who knows how long it was there. Probably a really long time from the way it looked and the way the handwritten price was scrawled on a little round sticky on the top of this single. $5.49 it said. Must be a good price for a beer that has a 100/100 rating here. I'm very excited to try it as it's my first Trappist ale. Poured out into a clean snifter, light golden as it poured and darkening as it collected in the bottom of the glass. Nice inch of flaxen head that sticks around in a fluffy layer floating on top. Scent reminds me of banana and raisins predominantly and maybe some orange and grapefruit too. As i swirl the glass, the head foams up again robustly. Upon the first sip, I'm not as terribly impressed as i expected to be. Strong malt backbone, candies of butterscotch and sugary burnt bananas predominate. Also raisins, dates, figs. But it's also somewhat bitter with an earthy, musty type taste to it. Somewhat leathery. The 11% is well hidden and doesn't come through too strongly. Comes with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full, well rounded, and highly carbonated. Overall it's a pretty good brew, but won't receive my highest marks. It's perhaps that I'm not trying several beers of this style in a row to pick the best. Perhaps my palate is still young and inexperienced. But regardless of what others say, I have to decide for myself. i tend to like big, heavy, thick, dense beers, with robust abvs, and maybe i was expecting the taste of a stout or porter. My only reference for this beer is really Golden Monkey, which I could just as easily pour if I wanted a beer of this style. Glad i tried it as it was quite the experience given the anticipation i had for this beer. However, i'm off to sample something a little heavier."
3849,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.26,"Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering half of the top. The aroma is of green apple and pear and earthy saison yeast. I’m tasting green apple and pear. The mouth is moderately carbonated, dry, and crisp."
3850,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,3.77,"I expected a little more for the price they are charging. Solid IPA, nothing more. The price gouging makes a ride to Charlton or VT for true world class beer a lot more appealing"

3853,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.3,"Bottle @ Perennial. Crazy cinnamon sugar, coconut, and marshmallow on the nose. Lots of dark chocolate, vanilla, fudge, and whiskey. Damn. The cinnamon really makes the flavor for me. Great spice balances out the sweet chocolate, vanilla, and coconut. A touch of marshmallow and somewhat moderate rye/whiskey. Awesome beer."

3856,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.73,Truly excellent well balanced and smooth double dry hopped pale ale. Salad hands of Citra with fruit flavors as well. Great aroma. Extremely well balanced beer and drink at 6.6%.
3857,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.61,"750ml bottle decanted into small snifters. Golden-orange in color with good clarity. Bracing tartness on the attack, but as the initial shock to the palate subsides, it opens into bright and beautiful flavors of fresh apricots, orange blossom and floral notes, and a very delicate and nuanced funk layer. Soft oak to round things out. It’s so fucking good. Completely captivating in its fresh and lively fruit flavor and in its balance. This is a personal favorite of mine, and one of the very few beers that I will begrudgingly admit lives up to the hype and then some. It’s a real treat to savor on the rare occasions it can be had."
3858,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.25,"Sparkling cider-like gold with a fizzy off-white foam quickly dying to a bubbling but clear surface. Aroma is green apple, pear and herbal white wine oak--I can see why adding additional pear works so well with this. Faint notes of skunky cannabis blossoms as it warms, only adding a welcome touch of complexity. Like an effervescent champagne, taste is white grape and tart apples with accents of peppery vinegar, without the acidity. The tingly semi-dry finish is lemony, as a faint straw funk arises at warmer temps. Bottled November 2016"
3859,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.59,"16 oz can poured into a snifter. Appearance: Pours a clear amber with 1 finger of head with decent lace Smell: Earthy and tropical hop aromas Taste: Sticky, tropical, and citrus hop flavors that interplay with some boozy malt notes that is incredibly well-balanced Mouthfeel: Medium with plenty of body, yet a satisfying finish Overall: This beer is certainly deserving of its reputation. This is absolute West-Coast in all respects. I did not expect to have such a quality DIPA like this in Ohio. This is worth going out of your way for."
3860,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.74,"I love 3F, and feel no other lambic producer comes close to their quality and complexity of gueuze.  The OGVs I have had fall short of A&T, but are decidedly more interesting than regular Oude gueuze (even older vintages of regular Oude gueuze). I have had OGV '07 (oxidized and flat due to artificial cork), '08 (huge funk and fruit), '12 (brisk acidity and wonderful mouthfeel - may become the best of the bunch with time).  All are world class with significant funk and complexity. Wish they weren't so hard to obtain!"
3861,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.18,"After waiting for many years to try this beer, it was very good but not the best quadrupel I've ever had. It has some nice dark fruit (fig, date, raisin) notes but it's surprisingly boozy. I no longer feel a need to acquire a case for aging purposes."
3862,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.35,"Pours an opaque orange gold color with a one finger bone white head that doesn't leave much lacing. Aroma has tropical notes of orange and grapefruit along with something a little more tart. Taste is more on the sweet side of the hops with the tropical flavors dominating, mostly in the citrus range. A dry tartness is still present but smartly stays in the background. Malt is lightly present and bitterness is low. Feel is very soft and smooth, not too effervescent, with a dry alcohol burn in the finish. This is a pretty damn good DIPA with the soft feel laid on very thick. Flavors are mellow yet very present. Any fan of NEIPAs would be very happy with this one."
3863,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.42,"Brown glass bottle served into a wine glass at the Toronado in San Diego. Paid out the ass for this (I think it around $50.00). If there's a beer to shell this much out for, certainly this is it. (Or at least one of them; see my Narke Kaggen Stormaktsporter review). Reviewed from notes taken in October 2012.  A: Pours a half finger delicate beige head of good lacing, nice thickness, and brief but appreciable retention. Colour is a pale peach-red. Nontransparent; non-opaque. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Has the appeal of a masterful red wine or bourbon. Classy and understated. I can't wait to try it. Sm: Sourness, bacteria, attenuated yeast, sour cherry, lactic notes, some malty sweetness, tart cherry skin, and bright fruit. Exceptional and clean. Promises some serious puckerworthy sourness. A moderate strength aroma. No alcohol comes through. T: Sour, with some serious bacterial notes on the back end. Incredibly crisp like fresh red apple yet outfitted with a wonderful solid cherry body. Refreshing and clean, yet lightly vinegary and even subtly wine-esque. I get the wood, but it's subtle and understated in the background. Rich and smcak-your-lips flavorful. Incredibly tasty stuff. Masterfully complex and balanced. No alcohol is detectable. So fresh and luscious. The lingering long aftertaste helps me enjoy it for longer. I get cherrywood as well as oak. Some pear. Green apple. It's got all the sourness I could ever want, but the perfect amount without feeling tamed. Not at all overdone. Clean malts lend it body but don't intrude, letting the sourness shine through. It has an incredible amount of body for a kriek, almost like a fine French cider. I'm blown away. Marvelously built. Nicely acidic, as well. Tartness is supreme.  Mf: Crisp, full, and of perfect thickness. Smack-your-lips delightful. Smooth and wet, letting the flavour speak for itself. Suits the flavour profile quite well.  Dr: An incredible kriek. Lives up to the hype, definitely. Worth the price for a special occasion. Another remarkable sour from Lost Abbey. I'd love to have this again (or the regular Cable Car, for that matter). The mouthfeel isn't perfect; it lacks the fragile delicacy I'd expect in a masterful sour - but it's still lovely. Few sours I've had have such presence and flavour. The depth of flavour and layers of mastery burgeon throughout. I detect at least five distinct acts in the structure: the sweet, clean open; the initial sour apple and hints of bacteria; the middling bacteria sourness blast; the fading cidery sharp climax with hints of lightly spicy yeast and cherry abound; and the lightly dry fruit cherry skin finnish. Remarkable. Wow. High A (4.43)"
3864,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.09,"Pours entirely flat, with no head to speak of, almost black, with a brighter hazelnut quality to it. Has a prominent, wooden alcohol bite on the nose, with lots of oak and earth, toning down the spices of the barrel. A toffee note evolves from this, sweet and rustic, with a dried raisin peak and lots of toasted coconut. Pretty complex, a new aroma nuance seems to be found, everytime I put my nose in the glass.  Drinks silk and slick with no hint of carbonation, showcasing each and every flavor quality. Its mouthfeel is medium bodied and entertaining till the last moment.  The beer's taste is not as complex as its nose, it got a defining silkness, together with a very powerful barrel, soothed by the soft mouthfeel. Chocolate pudding with some banana in it, bakers chocolate, molasses, black pepper and licorice. A charred wood bark quality sets in, together with toffee and the initially established silkness. A nice chocolate and wood defined alcohol dryness results from this, warming and flavorful with more toffee and a caramel sweet finish. Sweet, boozy, silk and oaken, these flavors define the beer, put into perfect balance to each other due to the soothing, silk mouthfeel."
3865,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,5.0,"Holy crap this is great beer. Was lucky to score some 4 packs by clicking on the link at 11am on Thursday when ordering opened. This changed my entire weekend for the better in all kinds of ways. This isn’t just beer, its karma. Citrusy, smooth, nice kick from the alcohol content. Swish swish bish!"
3866,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.49,16 oz can from Oregon via a friend. Pours a rich thick black with half finger of medium brown head. Aroma on opening can hits with maple syrup evoking a full pancake breakfast - in the glass the aroma remains strongly maple but with definite coffee notes and hints of chocolate.
3867,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.44,"Golden and hazy with loads of fast rising carbonation, and a half finger of white head. Smells very Brett forward. Funky, sour lambic qualities, earthy, dusty brewery filled with cobwebs that remind me of Cantillon. Oak barrel as well. There is a light fruitiness, perhaps peach but not yet distinguishable. Macaroni and a lactic milk like quality. Tastes of sour and slightly sweet, not bone dry. All the Brett, earthy, dusty lambic and oak come through, and it ends with fermenting fruit. Medium to strong, acidic body, with loads of carbonation. Got his first bottle in Sacramento, and I have a second one from Oregon waiting for me. Drinking for the first time Dec 20th, 2018. Complex and unique, funky brew."
3868,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,5.0,"Abner is perfectly balanced and not a pure juice bomb. The nose is pineapple and pine. The taste is less citrus and maybe more pine. The finish is clean but not crisp, a bit of a sweetness. Overall an exceptional NEIPA."
3869,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.51,"The look is much the same as any oily slick, pitch black stout. Minimal tan mocha head with lacing like a mother. The nose is CO CO NUT. Fuck I hate coconut, it’s more of a texture thing so the rest isn’t so bad. But that’s definitely all there is on the scent of this one, it covers up any chocolate or coffee that may be lying beneath it cold. The taste is YUUUGE coconut up front which is followed closely by decadent sweet chocolate, light roast coffee, and some lactose. Mouthfeel is decadent, not quite chewy, but nosing right up to it. Overall this is fantastic, they hit the nail on the head and I can appreciate that even if I don’t necessarily like coconut."
3870,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.62,"After being politely asked to vacate my Lyft for defecating in my freshly ironed Skidz, I'm dumped curbside in front of the gleaming ray of light known as Other Half Brewing. Waddling in like an elderly penguin entering a Best Western, I catch the attention of a beautiful bartender and order a beer. I take a sip and I’m instantly transported to Gordon Blevins' basement circa 1999. With Crazy Town’s smash hit “Butterfly” blastin' and ol' Blevy by my side, I couldn’t think of a happier time… until now. My Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream has finally come true. Unlike my shorts, this beer is super clean, light bodied and crisp, with no lingering flavors. It's super drinkable—you keep going back for more. Juicy, pithy tropical fruit on the back and peach supporting it nicely in the crack. A very nice DDH DIPA with a bitter bite in the finish. Just another great IPA from a great brewery. CROWLER™ thanks to myself."
3871,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.46,"Bottled 1 year ago. Pours deep ruby red with a short-lived head. The nose is strawberry, black cherry, green apple, and rose petals. The taste is cherry, grape, balsamic, some green olive, and dry barrel. The mouthfeel is medium minus, made taut by the barrel. Not as sour as expected. Tastes like a mature Cabernet. Overall, complex and tasty."
3872,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.34,"330ml bottle - BB 23.07.2024 - poured into a Belgian goblet at 40°F. Pours a deep dusky cola brown with rosewood highlights, topped with two large fingers of dense khaki head with impressive retention. Plentiful streaming effervescence.  Nose: Interesting aroma right from the start. The malt jumps out - bold and sweet with nutty aromas of caramel, cola, vanilla, dark bread, and brown sugar. Just a dusting of cocoa in the background. Some subtle yeast esters lend some bright lager-like notes with wisps of orchard fruits. Some faint Belgian phenol notes waft in and out of focus, and a thin thread of leather, dark fruits, and wet wood runs through it all.  Palate: The beer greets the palate malt-first, with some colourful complexity. Rather malty, with malted milk, bread crust, caramel, toffee, and toast, with secondary notes of Dutch cocoa, coffee and cream. It's quite nutty, perhaps with a hint of hazelnut, and then underlying notes of raisin and fig emerge. There is a hop presence to this, which lends some spicy, floral, and earthy notes in the background, with just a quiet whisper of bitterness. The ale finishes with bread crust, caramel, cocoa powder, and those spicy hops. Mouthfeel/Body This quadruple drinks with a medium-full body, while retaining a surprising crispness, with not nearly the weight a stout or barleywine with the same ABV would have. The rich malt is balanced by a crisp dryness that prevents the ale from being sticky or sweet. Effervescence is quite lively and fine. The finish is dry, due to the hops and subtle roast.  Overall: Between Westvleteren 12, St. Bernardus Abt 12, and Roquefort 10, it seems everyone is loyal to one. I've yet to open my Weary 12, but there's a clear difference between this and Bernardus. I'm sure all the top tier quads are great, and this is no exception, but I find it lacks the nuance and complexity of Bernardus. It is itself a great quad, and it finds wonderful balance between rich nutty malt and crisp dryness, while showcasing some lovely trappist influence, and for sheer drinkable, this may be the best. Either way, it's a fantastic quad - accessible, and worthy of its accolades."
3873,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.27,"SOUR Great sour beer, one to be shared. Pours a nice reddish black beer. Has very little bubbles, yet it is carbonated. Smell is of berries, cherries, etc. Taste is very tart, vinegary. It is not a thick beer, it is medium bodied. Taste remains in your mouth, as well as aroma."
3874,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,3.86,"16oz can poured into a snifter. A: In color it is as close to black as possible, a very dark brown. Three solid fingers of brown head rise on an aggressive pour. Retention is awesome and lacing is downright chunky. A really good-looking beer. S: Fudgey and roasty. Brownie batter and malted milk balls. Roasted barley. Smokey, maybe even a whiff of jerky. Bitter espresso. Coffee beans. Subtle red fruit and alcohol. T: Follows the nose. Very sweet on the attack. Fudgey, brownie batter, malted milk balls, glazed chocolate donut. Chocolate covered coffee beans. Cold brew. Redfruit undercurrents. Hints of roast and smoke. Stays sweet throughout, and finishes with a sugary chocolate flavor blanketing a kiss of smoke.  M: Full bodied with a sense of heft. Slick, creamy, and a bit sticky/syrupy. Prickling carbonation hits the tip of the tongue. O: It’s just a little too sweet, and it hinders drinkability. More coffee, roast, hop bitterness, or something that could help offset the sweetness a bit would probably bring it into balance pretty easily. I find this to be a recurring thing with many of Tree House’s stouts. Just a little too sweet for my taste, but that may be by design. The market seems to love “pastry stouts” and the like these days. I guess sweetness sells?"
3875,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.56,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass canned on 10/23/19. Pours a very attractive near pitch black with a massive 3 finger head that leaves massive waves of lace as it slowly settles, truly gorgeous. 5 Smell is maple, cocoa nibs, coffee, vanilla beans, and some coconut. 4.5 Taste follows maple is most dominant with vanilla, cocoa, coffee, and coconut in the back end really something special. 4.5 Mouthfeel is pretty darn big, gentle carbonation, a touch dry, and at 9.2% extremely drinkable. This one is a standout. 4.75 Overall this is really impressive, I love what they do with NEIPAs but this is a world class stout. 4.5"
3876,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,3.97,"03/2016 - I want to like this more but the nose is just unpleasant to me - it smells like plastic, basically. Thankfully, the palate is chock full of plum, nice oakiness, juicy fruit, with a touch of tartness in back; the finish is creamy, tart, and has a solid acidity."
3877,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.32,"From can. Very dark brown-black color with a good bit of lacing foam upon pour which stuck around as you drank. Deep dark and boozy aroma. Chocolate, coffee, roasty and malty. Softer, medium-thick mouthfeel. Reminds good bit of BA Ten Fidy."
3878,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.33,"Bottled 081419 per the bottle label. Clear, golden body; lively, small bubble carbonation; thick, sudsy head, dense and sculpted. Big wine, fruity and herbal smell; white wine; ripe apricots; green apples. The taste expands the aroma profile; tart and acidic; lime with a touch of lemon; semi-sweet Riesling wine quality; white oak. Medium body; mild sweetness complementing the acidic dryness.  This is a fine, complex yet easy drinking wild ale."
3879,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.77,"2013 version on tap at the 25th anniversary party.  Not the prettiest beer. Flavor and texture are indescribably amazing. (Review under construction). ******** 2019 version, from a 12 oz bottle. Once again, and as expected from HotD lately, this bottle pours completely still. Flat as can be. Beautiful nonetheless. The deepest shade of brown, slightly muddled and has a reddish tint to it that reminds me of dried blood. Obviously, there is no head to speak of and likewise no lacing. And there it is. That glorious HotD signature aroma. Much like Adam with notes of tobacco, leather, and jammy fig, but there's the unique and subtle addition of smoke that's perfectly incorporated. This is just an incredible explosion of flavors that are hard to disect. Fig, raisins, and apples give wonderful, sweet, fruity elements. Smoke, char, and wood balance them out, and leather and sopping tobacco leaves tie the whole experience together. You could almost cut and paste Adam's flavor descriptors and there in the smoke and apple, and that should just about sum it up. No carbonation leads to a very smooth, silky, and rich feel. Sweet and savory and surprisingly, the alcohol is almost completely hidden. Hard to believe being 11.5%!  Matt is just one of a kind. Absolutely friggin glorious and I'm so glad to have been able to experience this beer time and again both on draft and from the bottle, aged and fresh. No matter how you have it, Matt is one hell of an experience. Cheers."
3880,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.67,"I Wish I drank this beer super fresh, was more of a sour bomb by the time I drank it. Still delicious. The color was great! Mouthfeel was full bodied."
3881,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.68,"Incredible bomber, fresh 2020 bottling beautifully waxed, cracked and poured into a snifter... Incredibly jet black pour leaves a large dark brown head with visible red highlights...head fizzes away quickly. Cinnamon nose mixes with dark roasted malt, bourbon, espresso, and cocoa. Huge flavors...fudgy coconut, spiced vanilla, chocolatey molasses...booze, bourbon, oak...faint impressions of smoke and tobacco...thick brew...Mexican hot chocolate beer! Full, viscous body. Overall an incredibly complex and flavorful brew, Decadent, yet not cloying...spicy and boozy without being fatiguing...hugely recommended. The only thing keeping me from buying more is the $22 price tag."
3882,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.64,"750 ml, 2012 (bottled/released fall 2015). Pours between brick and blood red, slightly hazy, and with minimal head. Nose takes you down two roads. Fresh and acidic/preserved cherries and raspberries and ice cream come through. Alongside, dandelions, hay, Brett, and tart apple. Fruit is amazing compared to Rose de Gambrinus. I think this will be my first ever 5 for nose. Flavor has acidity and intensity of straight raspberry juice paired with funky lemon peel and a fresh herbal greenery that is hard to place. Almost like an intense mixed drink. Prickly crisp carbonation. Funky monkey this is a good beer, even compared to other Cantillon beers. Honestly, the intensity will make this 750 ml bottle an all afternoon affair."
3883,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.22,Bottle: Poured alight peachy color ale with a bubbly head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light apricot and tart notes is pretty refreshing and pleasant. Taste is a nice mix of tart notes with some fresh apricot notes and a white wine-like finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Acidity level is kept at a reasonable level. Very refreshing with solid mix of complexity.
3884,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.54,May 2020 Review
3885,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,3.67,"WAY too damn sour, puckering to say the least. Raspberries are normally one of my personal favorites added to a sour but this is utterly acidic and rough. Cant say I'd go after this again. not my jam and the side project label is what is carrying this in my opinion."
3886,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.8,"I have to admit this Lambik was difficult to attain and I had to pay. However, it was truly delicious. It was among the best Lambics, if not the best Lambic, that I've ever had. I also love blueberry, which certainly made this the perfect Lambic for me. It is unique and different yet similar to the best Lambics with its rich and tart flavors. Look: dark purple with a pinkish finger thick head Aroma: blueberry, lemon, oak.  Taste: The flavor is tart blueberry, blueberry skin, citrus, oak, some yeast,very refreshing, delicious and different. Body/Overall: light to medium body"
3887,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.62,"375ml bottle, that was bottled on '022218'."
3888,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.7,"The odd beer that smells better than it tastes. No issue as both are excellent. Medium dark color, nice head. Don't overdo this one, drinks more like a liquor than a beer."
3889,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.74,Poured the look and color of raw honey with an almost white head which leaves copious amounts of lacing.
3890,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.56,"Bottled on 2011; Poured June 2017 What a spectacular blend of sour (green apples, white wine vinegar, citrus) and earthiness (Brett, must, vinous oak) in the nose and taste and all perfectly drinkable as the pour warms a bit."
3891,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.7,"16.9 oz fancy/wasteful bottle poured into a tulip glass. Appearance is light red/pink with a moderate off-white head. Aroma and flavor are fresh-picked sour cherries, barnyard funk, white wine, oak, tannins, leather, vanilla, and malts with perhaps a touch of wheat. On a sour scale from 0-10 this is a 7 or 8. Mouthfeel is dry and slightly puckering. No alcohol is detectable. A delicious wild fruited sour ale."
3892,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.14,"Pours a slightly murky starburst dark orange with a finger and a half of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is earthy, citrusy, tropical fruity hops with a sprig of bready and earthy malts. Together it nets out a modestly sweet aroma. Flavor profile is tropical fruits and citrus packed in front of a lightly rindy, earthy, herbal hop blend. Hops are stacked on top of bready and earthy malts. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a very soft carbonated texture. Overall, fun and playful with slightly rindy earthy, citrusy hops that keep it drinking smooth and balanced. Not a typical juice bomb. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can."
3893,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.28,"32oz crowler poured into a snifter  A- pours a hazy orange color with a one-finger creamy white head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind  S- tangerines, orange pith, grapefruit zest, grass, hint of pine  T- a citrusy juice bomb; orange juice, tangerine, zesty grapefruit, even a hint of lemon. The finish adds a hint of grass And pineapple with more juicy citrus in the linger M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and continues into a creamy finish"
3894,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.32,"375 mL bottle from December 2016. Decanted carefully in case of sediment, Juicy pours an orange-copper with a thin layer of head from bubbles that rise up in a curiously slow way, as if the liquid is more viscous than it otherwise seems. Beautiful aromas of white wine, apple cider vinegar, papaya, honeydew melon, and orange blossom. The perfect amount of bright acidity on the tongue, enough to get the salivary glands pumping but not so much as to overwhelm the delicate complexity of flavors on parade here. I'm loving the influence of the wine barrels."
3895,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.79,"L: Warm golden hues of hay, straw, and apricot with a thin foamy head"
3896,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.38,"Pouring from a 500 ml. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out dark brown and forms black in the glass. It forms one finger worth of dense and creamy caramel colored crown. The smell is roastiness with some hop presence almost bringing a resin element into the mix. The taste brings a creamy note into the roastiness, while still delivering that hop presence. Mouthfeel is creamy. This reminds me a lot of Pappys Porter. Must be something about Vermont."
3897,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.42,"Pretty amber color, not red, not yellow but amber. Nice slightly off white head of dense foam with great retention and smears of clingy lace."
3898,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.18,"Look - Pours a very hazy orange/peach color, with a very nice head and great lacing. Smell - Has a subdued smell of sour apricot with a bit of funk. Taste - Tastes of sour apricot; not the sourest I've tried, but perhaps a bit sourer than I'd prefer. Feel - Has a light carbonation with a lingering sour taste. Overall - This is a nice sour beer, though it's not one of my favorites."
3899,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.71,"This beer perfectly rides the line between sweet caramel tones and bourbon oak. It is a little thinner than some of the heavy hitter barleywines like a deal with the devil, but it more than makes up for it with the pronounced barrel character. You can taste the aging process."
3900,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,5.0,"Pours hazy, orange gold in color with one inch head. Taste is big peach juice and watermelon. Medium body and carbonation, sweet. Wow this is good. This is super dialed in Haze with such a pillowy body. This is why I fell in love with this brewery. The creamy body is as awesome as I have had in a beer. No alcohol burn. Wow just wow. Best new Tree House beer in years."
3901,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.33,Poured from a 2017 bottle into a snifter. Carbonation is moderate. I was hoping this would be a bit thicker. Nice barrel presence in both aroma and flavor.
3902,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.59,"2016 bottle is drinking nice. Initially the cinnamon is most prevalent, but it gives way to lots of pepper and a thick, creamy body. No carb, but feel is on point. Definitely some heat from the pepper (not the barrel), not subtle."
3903,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.51,Pours pitch black. Very thick looking. 1 finger tan head. Head retention is good. Some lacing on the glass. 
3904,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.46,2017 Vintage. 
3905,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.52,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium dark brown head that recedes quickly. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, Chillies, and earthy chocolate. It tastes of cinnamon, nutmeg, mild spice from the Chillies, earthy chocolate, and light barrel. The feel is medium and well balanced. A great barrel aged stout, but not really blowing me away."
3906,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.86,"Beer #230 on my quest to complete the BA Top 250.  Hazy straw into a Speigelau IPA glass. Billowing head. Waves of tropical fruit, soft of the palate but full bodied. A tad sweet. Dank hops on the finish."
3907,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.75,another one thank's to jwb and maddogg...love ya mike. we just had bake and this one is way better in my opinion. everything is just a bit lighter and more in the right place. a bit less overwhelming in the feel/flavor. all the flavors are there.
3908,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.49,Spectacular. Looks are deceiving
3909,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.85,"Dark body is somewhat thin, but has a heavy feel. Tan ring hangs out as the beer goes down... Coffee is still pretty rich for being 2 years old. However, the base beer and bourbon barrel really dominate"
3910,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.59,From the 12 oz can (!?!) in a snifter. This solid imperial pours a rich
3911,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.66,"2012 bottled 2014, pour to snifter, purple, fine pinkish head, small head and slight lacing. Complex nose combines cherry with funk. Taste primarily sour cherry that is well balanced, not too sour or funky. Very dry and high carbonation."
3912,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,"OMG. Have this at the same time as I had KBBS- to be frank & honest about it, it was so good that it felt unfair to even think about rating with any lower then the mentioned merit in life. I had the coconut version and it was amazing! Thick, full and beautifully balanced sweet. Would love to have it again... And again"
3913,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.68,Had poured on-site at side project cellar from a 375ml bottle. Wow is it spectacular with a tart punch to the face that finishes smooth from the apricot. Very delightful mouth feel that makes this perfect for a summer day
3914,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.46,"Canned 1/19, about a week and a half ago. A: Pours like orange juice—an impenetrably hazy medium orange with a cap of bright white head. Excellent retention and generous swaths of lacing. S: Bright hop aromatics of mango, pink grapefruit, and guava. Medium-light background honied malt sweetness and dried flowers.  T: Dense, thick mango juice, with light floral background providing some complexity. Moderate sweetness accentuates the juice aspect. M: Medium-full body, chewy and fairly creamy, with medium-light, tingly, carbonation. O: Another superb DIPA from Monkish that ticks all the NE IPA boxes."
3915,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.0,"Description: Appearance is glassy and black with a small amount of dark, tan foam. Smell is deep and rich, with cinnamon and chilies dominating. Chocolate, vanilla and bourbon are also evident, providing for a complex aroma. The taste carries the same cinnamon and chilies, but they are extremely prevalent, to the point that the bourbon, chocolate and other underlying flavors are drowned out. It’s a hot, spicy and slightly bitter finish that doesn’t keep up with the richness of the smell. Feel is a little thin for a stout with low carbonation as can be expected. Overall: 3.75 (This beer is good but I would not likely drink it again) Man…had high hopes for this but honestly just didn’t enjoy it that much. The aroma was great, but the taste put me off. It was too spicy/hot for me and the bourbon seemed to get completely lost. Given the BA rating and how outstanding Jackie O’s is with stouts, I apparently set my expectations too high."
3916,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,3.95,"2016 - Cerberus poured into a sulry snifter tasting glass  L: pours like clean oil brown but allows some light, darker in the glass but not pitch black. "

3918,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.87,L : Generic golden amber color.
3919,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,5.0,Glad I tracked down a growler of this!!! This turned out to be as good as everybody says! Hard to get! They need to bottle this beautiful Rick chocolate and raspberry BA stout!
3920,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.43,"i've had this guy before and thought it was alright. this is the most recent batch 500ml poured into a perfect stout glass looks good in the glass, completely dark with a khaki head. darker than expected aroma brings forth bourbon, some sweetness, tasty malts, some more oak and alch at the tail end taste follows the aroma, but the oak wallop is fantastic! much more vanilla in the flavor. finishes sweet with some alch. malts have some baltic porter notes mouthfeel really carries this one. alch is still present, unusual for hf. but the velvet body really makes this nice overall i wasn't expecting to enjoy this one so much. real tasty, i wouldn't mind having it again. a few steps behind gom tho"
3921,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,Very similar to Assassin but somehow better. So does this make this beer a 5+? Might need to adjust your rating scale BA to make Ron for a beer this good. Best nonmaple BA bet I have ever had.
3922,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.84,"Bottled 1/19 - beautiful straw color, thin cream head hangs out. Smells like citrus and bread, tastes similar with a lot of complexity. Really easy to drink with medium tartness. Love it"
3923,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.29,"Vintage 2013! I had a 2015 after 1 year of aging. This is better, but is mostly booze and sugar at this point. A bit too drinkable for 18+%. Prost!"
3924,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,3.97,"Motor oil black with burnt brown edges and no head but for some floating chunks of coconut lipids. Taste is waffle cone and tangy chocolate malt with a touch of raisin. As it warms it develops some serious toffee and peanut brittle, but it's syrupy thick and sticky, and pretty cloying with a warming heat. I also get a little molasses on the nose. It's no where near as good as the previous Coffee Shop Vibes, and it doesn't touch the Kane Coconut ANTEAD I had in the same sitting. Considering this batch 2 bottle got a huge amount of hype, it's just another STL bottle that didn't live up to it."
3925,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,3.88,Tastes like a barbeque pork chop dipped in vanilla icing. I do not understand this beer or the hype. I will not be hunting any more dark lord variant. Pass.
3926,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.43,Another tasty variant of a successful beer. Gets better and better as it warms. Nice bitterness but not overpowering so it balances the alcohol and offsets sweetness so that too is not overpowering.
3927,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.79,"L: Golden yellow pour with minimal head and visible lacing.  S: Sweet citrus, subtle oak, and a strong vinous notes.  T: The beer starts off with a pop of stone fruit sugar sweetness, followed by waves of wine barrel character and a touch of heat from the alcohol. As it warms, lemony tart citrus notes emerge and the wine flavor shines through, enveloping the base beer.  F: Incredibly soft and delicate mouthfeel. Everything about this beer is clean and balanced. The carbonation is spot on. The finish is dry.  O: Perhaps one of the finest examples of what Hill Farmstead is capable of producing. The finished product is unrivaled by anything I have had in craft beer."
3928,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.5,"Ho-ly cow! Had this on site today, splitting the bottle with a few friends. Un-be-levable. So thick, so rich. You would never guess the high ABV. Coffee. Could drink forever."
3929,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,3.6,2018 bottle sampled from a plastic cup at midnight in the parking lot of Forager Brewing awaiting Nillerzzzzz/Crema release the next morning. I can understand why someone might like this style of beer but the sour notes of the Belgian Fruit Lambics just are not my thing.
3930,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.75,"Exceptional IPA. Similar to Sip of Sunshine but definitely better. Brewers like to use the phrase ""bursting with flavor"" but this beer really is. Aroma and taste are everything I want in an IPA. No hazy, chalky, yeasty crap just a great, strong, balanced beauty of a beer. I think it's better than Heady Topper. yb"
3931,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.69,"L-dark, black as you would expect. dark tan lacing S-Spices, dark fruit, oak, vanilla, brandy, tons going on very complex. T-brandy ,dark fruits ,oak ,chocolate, spices, chilies very complex, amazing taste. very decadent ,sweet, dessert like. Could taste this 100 times more and probably pic out different flavors F-full bodied low carbonation. O-amazing one of my favorites in recent memory"
3932,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.51,"Pint can - dated 10/11/19 - poured into an RC IPA glass at 46F. Pours a turbid, nearly milky, delightfully glowing pale orange hue, topped with a very short head that quickly recedes to a thin film and collar. A small swirl deposits some scant lacing along the glass.  Nose: The aroma is bursting with ripe, succulent citrus aromas - orange juice, pomello, and grapefruit - along with a big bouquet of ripe tropical and stone fruits. Lots of mango, some guava, pineapple, and a hint of papaya, with secondary notes of kiwifruit, strawberry, blueberry, coconut, lychee, peach, nectarine, and a remarkably sweet, exotic fruity element that I simply cannot place. The aroma is completely saturated, sweet, and fruity, and bears no earthy, musty, or funky components.  Palate: The beer greets the palate with a forceful, sugary sweetness, which is to be expected from a dry-hopped beer of this calibre. It isn't a starchy, malty sweetness, but rather a concentrated fructose sweetness, like ripe tropical fruit. Speaking of ripe tropical fruit, the flavour is bursting with ripe mango, pineapple, papaya, and overripe peach, the latter being very indicative of the Galaxy hops that are crammed into this. There are some bright, juicy, slightly acidic notes of orange juice and grapefruit, which highly compliment the pineapple notes, and also help to cut through some of the sweetness. Much of this acidity is presumably hop burn, though it's restrained enough to be enjoyable, adding a layer of complexity rather than being detrimental to the beer itself. There is just a touch of earthy dankness which is also to be expected from a bill containing any amount of Galaxy. I suspect the grist contains a measurable amount of oat, as the malt is clean, fairly neutral, and possesses practically zero graininess. The finish is quite fruity and floral, before the sweetness gently subsides, allowing just a touch of resinous bitterness to peek through at the very end, before lifting off, leaving a clean, oaty dryness and a whisper of peach lingering. Mouthfeel/Body: It's a big, bold, dry hopped New England double IPA clocking in at 9.3% ABV, AND it's from Trillium. Anyone who has had a big Trillium IPA can imaging that this beer is just one massively fluffy hoppy pillow. The beer is soft, fluffy, creamy, and velvety smooth, yet still possesses enough effervescence to lend texture and cut through some of the heft. Nevertheless, this is a very stout beer, and is by no means a midday summer refresher. While the flavour profile would allow this to pair nicely with food, I think the sheer weight of it may prevent it from being the ideal mean accompaniment. Also bear in mind that aside from the heft of this beer, it shows little-to-no evidence of it's ABV, which could make this a dangerous little creeper. Overall: For what this beer is, it's hard to find much, if anything wrong with it. It's a wonderfully fruity, sweet, succulent double (verging on triple) IPA crafted with the trademark uniqueness that has made Trillium a cult classic. It embodies everything the brewery is known for, from its top-tier hops, to the pillowy mouthfeel, all packed into a whopper of a beer, that's easy and enjoyable to drink. A true hoppy cornerstone of the Trillium lineup."
3933,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.23,"2018 bottle. Teku pour. Preface that I generally prefer BA stouts without coffee. L - Fizzy, translucent black with thick bubbly head. Looks very highly carb'd. S - Tastey aroma but hardly differentiated from a founders breakfast stout. There is a little more sweetness which I'm getting maple from (but is that the power of suggestion?). Wasnt blown away by CBS but to memory I liked its aroma more. Note that I'm also getting cinnamon as it warms. T - Oh damn that's sweet. Coffee is more muted than most which I appreciate. The maple syrup is tough to find, but it's there (somewhere. I think?). The roast level is dark in the coffee and the malts. The bitterness found is medium to high and begins to develop as it warms. Overall very rich in flavor. F - Very highly carb'd. I would not define it as ""thick"" regardless of its sweetness and sugars. Feel is status quo and not necessarily anything noteworthy. O - Solid beer. Top 250 beer that trades for $75? Lol. This is a hype beer and why I think I'm giving up trading, at least for ""limited"" beers. It is a good beer, and I'd be happy to buy it once or twice at cost if I were local. But for California to hype bottle logic to their ""value"" or Florida to hype JWB or AC, or my local brethren here in PA to hype Voodoo to the tradde ""value"" that they soar to makes me just want to laugh. If you're into paying for the name on things then the aforementioned breweries (and MANY more) are what you're looking for. I'm more than over seeking out these super limited beers. I'll drink the few others I have in my cellar and stick to the equally tastey shelf beers."
3934,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.22,"Pours a cloudy burgundy with a thin almost pinkish white ring of foam around the edge. The nose is not stellar in this beer. Strong barnyard, but not pleasant like other cantillon beers. A bit vinegary and only hints of the vine. The taste is altogether different from the nose. Very balanced with an ultra sweet middle, mild funk, and clean dry finish. Not really vinous in flavor, more grapeish. Feel is light and effervescent. Overall this beer scares you when you take a whiff but it unexpectedly lives up to the hype in the flavor which has no bearing to the smell. There is a little bit of wine in the nose but approaches more grape."
3935,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.24,"Black in color with no penetration to light. No head. The aroma is of intensely dark black roasted coffee and dark malt. I’m tasting dark coffee, bacon fat, and dark malt. The mouth is oily, thick, and viscous."
3936,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.47,"Ok this looked more like orange juice than any beer I've ever seen. Nice, pulpy orange juice. Aroma was of citrus lactic sourness.  Taste, wow, amazing stuff, I must admit. Kept going back and forth between this and Bourbon County Coffee at the festival. So much apricot, orange and light oak impressions. This is really up there with Fou Fune, slightly better than Cascade Apricot, Bruery Filmishmish & Rare Barrel Map of the sun. Great fruit flavors, just the right amount of sourness without too much harsh acidity."
3937,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.42,"Had this on 2018-10-31 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz canned on 2018-10-09 A - Very hazy orange with a 1/3-finger white head and good lace.  S - Melon, pineapple, peach, orange, biscuit, mildly dank. Sweet and inviting.  T - Pineapple, apricot, orange, melon, biscuit, onion grass and herbal spice. Orange zest and pine bitterness in the finish is just the right amounts.  M - Medium body and light-medium carbonation. Smooth, soft, chalky and pleasantly resinous with a mild prickle at the end.  O - A step up from Melcher Street. Really a first rate brew with an aroma and flavor profile that works well for me."
3938,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.56,"Og, 2016. Best batch and best coconut stout. Coconut check . Barrel check. Smooth checkout!  Last batch had basically no coconut, very disappointed."
3939,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.43,"Traded for this and a few other bottles from Tree House this week, as I never had anything dark and heavy from them before. Although the Vanilla Bean take on this was better, this was a solid beer that felt like sensual coffee in a bottle. If you like your beer to be roasted, slick, and complemented by appropriate flavors, then you've found your match right here! Of course, this poured quite dark like coffee with plenty of bubbly, tan head to top it off. That took a while to settle as there was plenty of clingy, sudsy lacing left behind from the moment I took the first sip of this. Fresh-roasted coffee, vanilla bean and extract, rich chocolate, and tangy blood orange filled the subtle nose as white chocolate sweetness, espresso bean, and soft cream came in to take this beer to the next level. Like it's other iteration, this came across as an ""Imperial Breakfast Stout"", if one were to actually exist. Roasted Malt somehow emerged through all of these flavors and enhanced this beer, as it gave it depth without making it feel dry or typecast in the process... Amazingly, the booze in this was present enough to be felt but understated enough to let the other flavors take hold, from the get-go on out. A tiny presence of plum and dark fruit took hold before I finished this off as the acidity from that and the blood orange presence was enough to elevate this from the chocolate-coffee-vanilla threshold that holds so many beers of this type back. Like their more famous IPA's, this was a beer from Tree House that's worth seeking out or trading for - can't recommend anything in this series highly enough!"
3940,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.48,"L: Hazy light Amber with a big bubbled head and very little lacing. S: Pine, grapefruit, mango, and citrus pith hop aroma. Big peach esters. Also a fairly substantial candied malt character for the style. T: Big pine resin, grapefruit, and mango/pineapple flavors. Substantial bready caramel malt balance. The bitterness is firm but never dominates. F: Medium/light bodied, very dry, crisp finish. Overall: I was really impressed with this one. I honestly prefer it to Heady, which is saying a lot. I cannot recommend this on enough."
3941,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.42,"Canned 9/16/19; drank 9/24/19 @ the Yarchives.  Motor oil black appearance.  A violent pour yielded a HUGE dark khaki head; frothy, tree-rung lace.  Medium roast coffee bean, chocolate syrup & faint fresh earth notes in the nose.  Creamy, medium thick mouthfeel.  Malted milkshake flavors; this is a rich dessert treat. I'd gladly have another..."
3942,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.77,"Hearty pink liquid, amazing clarity, lighter pink substantial head. Aroma was drops heavy sour cherry notes, not dark cherry, bright red, bitter, powerful yet light cherry. Even with that amount, a legit +9 on the 1-10 scale, some oak still comes in. Taste hits that 8 note on the scale, massive cherry drop only to be rivaled by LPK from Cantillon probably. Floats over the wheat. Was surprised when writing my review today to see this is now retired. Glad I got a few when I did, high ass price tag on these, but you're entitled to it on your birthday friend."
3943,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.01,"12oz can, dated 11.24.2020, poured into a stemless wine glass. The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a finger of khaki head that has good retention and excellent lacing. The aroma is nice, lots of rich dark chocolate, roasted grain, bourbon barrel, charred oak, warm spirit, toffee, caramel, coconut and stone fruits. The flavors are good, assertive roast, toasted grains, charred oak, warm spirit lead to a softer and more rich chocolate profile that is complimented by elements of vanilla, coconut and toffee with a nice stone fruit finish. The mouthfeel is good, coating, nice medium body that is full and rich with a nice vibrancy and a finish that is warm and lightly dry. Verdict: A nice BA stout from Oskar Blues. Ten FIDY showcases a lot of the classic RIS flavors and this barreled version is a nice spin. The barrel character is nice, more oaky than bourbon forward, but offers a nice depth to the beer."
3944,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.14,"Just an enormously hopped beer that blows beyond what my finicky palate can handle these days. Carry on and pick up the info you seek from a more hop-headed review. About as archetypical, in look and taste and feel, for a 9%+ NE Style DIPA that without the darling new hops in the mix (Mosaic, Citra, Galaxy, etc.). Just an enormous specimen that will hop-punch your pie hole out the back of your head."
3945,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.49,"Pours straw gold, half inch head. The hops come right at you and for me it’s a bit too forward. The aroma is fantastic, up there with the best. Strong, notes of refreshing fruits, citrus, apple. Apple is a good one to hang on, there’s a crispness to the beer. The slight distraction for me is the finish. It coats the back of my tongue with a slight pithiness."
3946,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.29,"2021 release. Great smell of raspberry jam right upon cracking the can. Dualing raspberry and cocoa powder on the palate, with a shot of bourbon as a chaser. Excellent barrel character. Good legs for 12% ABV, but slightly thinner than expected."
3947,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.69,"2019 Vintage poured into a 6oz stemmed taster. Very impressed by the mouthfeel on this one. Low carb, very chewy and silky smooth without a syrupy texture or overly saccharine quality. Complements the flavor profiile--warming winter spice/gingerbread--perfectly. Smells of sweet gingerbread, brown sugar, semisweet chocolate/a little fudge, and a touch of hot cinnamon. Warm and inviting without being overly intense or tacky. Taste follows the nose with the addition of light bourbon barrel vanillins and oak so well integrated into the dark chocolate roast profile that an absentminded drinker could easily believe this beer spent no time in barrels. I quite honestly do not think Fremont could have melded the flavors in this beer any better. Any complaint I could have would be of the style rather than the execution."
3948,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.29,"12/2017 - 2015 vintage - From what I heard, the 2013 vintage is way better than this; that said, this was good - solid bourbon, toffee, caramel, and some vanilla; thinner body than I'd expect from a barleywine."
3949,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.7,"L:. Pours a hazy golden orange with a really foamy white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. S:. Lots of fresh oak and woody, a very strong farmhouse Brett, notes of toasted bread and a touch of citrus and pepper. I love how funky this beer is. T:. Lots of fresh oak, a strong earthy woodiness from the Brett followed by a nice touch of strong farmhouse and farmyard funk, mixes with some toasted bread and some notes of pepper, tart and a touch sour but not overwhelming. The Brett is kong ins this beer and I love it how it has developed. F:. Light to medium body, smooth with a touch of spritz. O: This beer is a major showcase for the Brett and it is fantastic, if you want a Brett heavy beer this is the one for you!"
3950,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.48,"09/2014 - Incredible raspberry and cherry aromas with some oaky, yeast coming through; tart, acidic, fruity, flavorful body; wee thin of a body, but it's superb overall!"
3951,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.23,Fresh can courtesy of SierraNevallagash from brewery’s recent drop. 16 days old. 
3952,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.25,"Unknown vintage; drank 10/22/15 on draft @ Fischman's.  Black/brown appearance.  Minimal dark tan head; nice lace.  Cream, chocolate syrup & rich coffee notes in the nose.  Medium thick mouthfeel.  Rich cream, roasted coffee bean & chocolate syrup flavors; rich, smooth & easy to drink with no booze heat.  Very nice."
3953,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,5.0,"Smooth and juicy. Crushable at 5.8% but costly, I enjoyed this beer immensely - Smooth on the tongue and soft on the way down. A beautiful hazy color, a champagne of beer."
3954,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.57,I’m glad I don’t live closer to Treehouse. I’d be broke and probably be on the waiting list for a liver transplant. Another winner that’s also relatively low abv. Keep ‘em coming!
3955,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.69,"Had on tap. Void of nothingness black with a brown head. Sweeter nose than I was expecting: maple, chocolate, vanilla with contrasting powerful oak, robust malts, coffee grounds, char, and lingering licorice and earth. Taste leans much more on the robust elements, but has great melding of the flavors from the smell in a foreboding way. Massive and complex. Body is full and chewy, but not overly heavy, great wood textures and smoky earthiness within the booze. Well worth the search, an amazing stout that does not need adjuncts to thrill"
3956,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.67,I need more of this in my life. A well balanced beer that has the flavors and barrel character brilliantly blended together. Unbelievably smooth for the monster ABV. Bottle was 2011 and time has been extremely kind to this beauty!
3957,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,3.97,"12oz. can served in a nonic. Canned 7/2/19. Pours a hazy, dull orange with a tight, one inch, bright white head. Nose is fairly subdued - subtle aromas of citrus, pith and biscuity malt with perhaps a kiss of tropical fruit at the back. Taste consistent with nose, albeit brighter and the tropical fruits notes are more pronounced towards the middle and a hint of herbal/medicinal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel if light-medium, with an easy, even carbonation. Overall, tasty and quit edrinkable."
3958,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.43,2016 version poured into a snifter. A hazy golden color with a medium white head. Aroma was tart fruit. The taste followed but with a complex Bretty note. Overall a delicious blonde ale. Slightly tart and with complex phenolic notes. Outstanding.
3959,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.25,Canned 6 weeks ago. L -- Orange juice haze in the glass with two fingers of off-white head produced with moderate pour. Pretty quickly dissipating but leaves some nice lacing
3960,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.43,"Pours a hazy golden color. Aroma is tart and funky. Flavor is smooth gueuze tartness with a smooth acidic finish. Tastes like it as a little fruit in it. Feel is excellent, very velvety. Overall delicious."
3961,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.15,Good beer. Way to overhyped. If you have a chance to try it then go for it. But not even close to being worth what people are asking. You've been warned.
3962,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.59,"To my surprise I just found this in TX. Had heard loads about it, so here we are with their pale ale. "
3963,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.95,"Canned 04/01/21, this pours cloudy sand/orange color with a huge foamy off-white colored head that faded very slowly and left excellent foamy lacing coating the sides. Just as impressive as the regular Julius so far. The aroma is amazing; I can smell the dank juicy hops from a foot away from the glass. I was watching the head go down with the glass on the table away from me and able to smell pineapple, mango, tangerine, peach, grapefruit, tropical fruit, wet hops, fresh sticky weed, faint piney notes, biscuit, apricot, Razzles candy, clementine and herbs. It's super fresh smelling and similar to ripping open and orange in the citrus burst that hit by nose as I went in for each sip. I'm happy this tastes as good as it smells with the same lineup in the flavor: pineapple, mango, tangerine, peach, grapefruit, tropical fruit, wet hops, fresh sticky weed, faint piney notes, biscuit, apricot, Razzles candy, clementine and herbs. It gets better as it also unleashed honeydew melon, faint caramel, lime, graham cracker, tea leaf and/or coriander, some bready notes and real mild spices as it starts to fade off dry and clean. Bitterness level was low which helped make it so smooth as it hid the ABV that it was like a super charged wet hopped beer that drank like a session IPA. Ridiculously easy to drink, this lived up to the hype as well."
3964,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.27,"Nice looking dull golden hazy almost milkshake look with a thinning white head. Flat out orange juice nose on this puppy. Wonderful flavor translation, this is a sweet tropical brew with just mild bite on the end that lingers a bit. Just less than creamy feel on this brew, I’m pretty impressed."
3965,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.43,"The viscous used motor oil pour of black with dark brown ribbons builds a dark mocha blanket that audibly fizzles out quickly. Taste is intense of coconut, as if it were just very recently, freshly toasted, and to absolute, unbelievable perfection. It's the most spot on expression of toasted coconut in a beer I think I've ever had. And this is right off the jump. It doesn't get floral, or astringent, or too sticky sweet either. There's a little bit of a cinnamon bark and bourbon barrel kick to the nose, while on the palate the coffee is the stronger contributor, enhancing the chocolatey malt by creating a divine mocha waffle cone character. It's a full on dessert assault vehicle. The feel of the body isn't quite so viscous as it looks, but it's substantially thicker than any other Bottle Logic stout I've had. However, because of its thickness, the barrel doesn't seem to come through as much in flavor. It finishes semi-sticky with a little bit of heat, but...the bottom half of the bottle...got dam! It becomes even thicker, and also more coconuty and chocolatey, and just absurdly luscious. I guess I forgot to Shake Well!"
3966,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.93,"12oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Picked up from liquor store for around $10-12. 2020 vintage No.11 printed on front label. Appearance - Black opaque body with a small, brown, creamy one-finger head with decent to low retention, good lacing and stick. Head easily regenerates with a swirl. 4.75 Smell - Dark fruit. Plums. Very vinous, rounded out with some chocolate and roasted coffee character. 4.75 Taste - Absolutely incredible. Flawless. Balanced. Bold up strong dark characters upfront but mellows out into a slow, rich, robust journey to a perfect aftertaste. 5 Mouthfeel - Smooth, creamy. Warming. 5 Overall - No off characters whatsoever. 5"
3967,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,5.0,"2019 vintage poured into a teku-style glass. Looks like fresh squeezed peach juice with a thin white ring of head and small islands on the surface. Aroma is sweet stone fruit jam, vinegar, and wild yeast funk. Flavors are peaches, apricots, nectarines, and acidic vinegar. It has a very full mouthfeel, just the right amount of carbonation and puckering tartness. The finish is mouth-coating, and the flavors linger in a good way. This beer definitely lives up to its hype."
3968,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.79,"Black with tan foam. Whiskey, roasted malt.  Sweet liquor/vanilla, cola, not really roasted malt. Gives a sugary marshmallow flavor. Not piecing despite ABV. Very low carb, not all that thick."
3969,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.71,"This is indeed a great Belgian Lambic. It might be the best Lambic I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't easy to get in the states. Look: semi-clear red with a brown tint and a half inch white slightly pinkish head. The color is very vivid and it looks beautiful. Aroma: grapes, cherry, red wine Taste: The flavor is grapes, tart cherry, maybe some grapefruit, red wine, oak, some nice moderate yeast-funkiness. It has a long and pleasant after taste of tart grapes and cherries. It is not too tart. Body/Overall: despite having a light/medium body and being tart it comes across as creamy and soft. It fills the mouth."
3970,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,"08/2015 - Typical Trillium juiciness on the nose with orange, tangerine, and some citrus up front; notable onion on the palate with a nice sweetness, creaminess, and slightly bitter back end; the finish is clean, bright, fruity, and a touch dank."
3971,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.48,750ml bottle. Caged and corked bottle. 2014 Project Vintage.
3972,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.7,"Canned 2/3. Hot damn this is fresh, dank, and resinous as hell. Crushing, pungent citrus dominates up front with a nicely balanced bitter pine note joining at the end."
3973,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.11,"Nose: Maple Syrup, Doughy French Toast, Fresh Cold Brew Coffee Taste: Sweet Maple Syrup, Cinnamon French Toast, Coffee with Cream, Chocolate Syrup Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium Body, yet a Heavy Creamy mouthfeel with good Carbonation, Perfect amount of sweetness, a definite breakfast stout"
3974,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.77,"Beautiful beer. I felt like the most recent release of Foggy was an out of the park, walk off homer. Foggier is a walk-off double (no pun intended.) It's very close to being a straight up 5 but lacking some complexity. Despite that, a phenomenal offering from Lord Henry!"
3975,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.44,"This beer pours like motor oil. Thick, black. Tan head, 1 1/2 finger. Retention is good, and nice lacing on the glass. "
3976,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.63,"Had on tap. The pour is jet black and emits strong coffee and cream aromas with a burst of rye whiskey booziness at the end. The taste is magnificently focused on the coffee yet pulls in plenty of other rich flavors such as fudge, booze barrel, vanilla, molasses and cinnamon. Can just chew on this beer for hours"
3977,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.63,"Canned 12 days ago. L -- The expected glowing orange haze, with a well-retaining solid white head"
3978,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.61,"Pours a darkish, hazy yellow/orange. Great head and lacing. The aroma is overripe mango and orange with peach and a light candied malt character. The flavor follows suit with a smooth bitterness, juicy tropical fruits, overripe citrus and some sweet cereal grains. The mouthfeel is lush and velvety, and the beer finishes cleanly on the tongue. Overall, this reminds me a lot of very hazy with the overripe fruit character. Very little dankness, and huge juiciness. World class for sure."
3979,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.5,"This was my first beer from Prairie, and it's been one of my favorite shelf beers since then. Around here it runs about $5.49-6.49/12oz bottle. A bit pricey, but for what you get in the bottle, it's worth my money. Standard stout appearance. Dark body, tan head. Not incredibly thick, but good character. Smell is almost all chocolate and coffee. Taste follows smell with slight pepper burn on the back end. The pepper is mellow compared to beers like Mexican Cake, but it's definitely there. Feel is nice. Like I said earlier, not thiccc, but kinda slick. Leaves a coating on the tongue. Overall, this is a beer a walk past a lot lately, but it's always good a special place in my heart. My favorite shelf beer by far!"
3980,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.59,"Pours a beautiful straw - light orange color. Pitch white frothy head which dissipates fairly quickly leaving a sudsy ring around the glass. Nose is ripe apricot, stone fruit, prickly pear, getting some oak, barnyard funk, bready yeast. Taste. Taste is follows the nose, getting apricots, green apple, lemon, a little grassy note. Tart, but not puckering. Acidic, but not harsh. Great smooth pillowy mouthfeel. Soft on the palate. Overall a fantastic fruited Saison. Everything you would want, very well balanced."
3981,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.18,"2014 vintage poured from bottle at Cantillon in August 2017. Pours a nice purple with light purple head that quickly dissipates. Beautiful beer. Nose is woody, tons of sour cherries, earthy, and a bit viney. Taste is so smooth. Not much sourness, but a lot of cherries! I wouldn't call this an overly complex beer, but super tasty and smooth. Mouthfeel is perfect."
3982,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.0,"Black with burnt red edges and a fizzy tan collar. Smell is caramel, buttered popcorn with sticky coconut, sticky toffee and light coffee. Taste is a little hot, with bourbon vanilla bean, round roasted walnut, maple, toasted coconut, and chocolate. This was really good but I actually enjoyed the regular Medianoche better."
3983,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.67,"Kuhnhenn 4th D - unfortunately I have no idea which vintage this is, due to a missing vintage label: stored it in the fridge for about a year. Pours a dark brown color with a quickly disappearing khaki brown head. Smells of unsweetened coconut shell, earth and scented wood, enriched by dried grapes and old oak. Offers a nice Bourbon spiciness which gets entangled into toasted nuts and grilled corn. Surprisingly earthy, focussing on the barrel without turning just a tad too sweet, creating a spicy, warm complexity on the nose which is awesome.  Drinks truly soft, establishing a great silkness, which unfolds the Bourbon in all its powerfull facets. Its hot bite gets balanced by the rich toasty malt base, creating a powerful, complex beer. Tastes of sugar glazed malts, a hint of licorice, dusty woodbark and toasty, bready malts. Spicy, sweet cinnamon and bakers chocolate add to the malt backbone, while a warming Boubon sharpness slowly becomes more and more recognizable. Ends sweet with a well integrated booziness, showcasing even more tongue tickling spices and toasty toffee malts. Finished very clean and soft, with a heavy Bourbon appearance defining the taste. Masterfully balanced, intense beer, reminding of a Barley Wine at first glance, which from there on transforms into something different. All flavors work very harmoniously together, exhibiting a slowly uprising Bourbon sweetness which reveals a respectable amount of earth and bread. At its peak sweet toffee and scented wood add to the taste, never forgetting its rustic, bready roots. Finishes utmost clean after revealing its breathtaking complexity, calm after unleashing an intense flavor storm on the palate. Despite its taste intensity the beer drinks incredibly soft and almost easy if it wasn't for the perfectly integrated Bourbon, which works so good with the beers profound malt foundation."
3984,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.44,Very hard to believe this one is 10%. Super drinkable for that ABV. Nose is a rush of lactic sourness and peachy stonefruit. Definitely a tart one but not overly so. I'd grab more of these if it weren't super expensive.
3985,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.61,Opaque orange whiteish color with a thick head with decent retention. 
3986,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.55,"Classic Bottle Logic! Batch 1, 2, 3, and 4 are in particular great. Mouthfeel is fantastic and the vanilla is very well balanced. I know some people get a fudge brownie vibe, but I think its more straightforward vanilla"
3987,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.45,Had 2014 version aged for 2 years 4 months. Very smooth and lots of taste. Had a smooth cognac barrel taste with no heat to it. Compares well to MOAS. Had a debate over which was better. Think I prefer Moas by a hair though I'd have to side by side to be sure.
3988,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.49,"On tap at Green Cheek in Costa Mesa, CA. Wow. Wow. Wow... This thing just pops at you like a Jack In The Box on steroids. I mean, WOW! Sure, it’s looks all nice and Saison-y, but the aroma... the taste... Kaboom! Like Hank Aaron during a home run trot, this one is a winner.  Get it and get it good, my children."
3989,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.65,"L: Hazy yellow orange with a modest, small bubbled head and good lacing. S: Sweet tropical fruits, orange pith, garlic and onion. Very subtle malt. T: Smooth bitterness, moves into flavors of citrus, mango, pineapple, and more garlic and onion. The malt is very subdued adding a clean bready backdrop. F: Soft, light bodied for the strength, slight creaminess. Overall: A insanely delicious beer. One of the best DIPAs I have ever had."
3990,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.5,"Appearance - The beer poured a fuzzy black color with a mocha colored head crowning the glass. Smell - The nose was malty bourbon. The booze does not dominate. There was a nice malty presence.  Taste - this was like barrel aged chocolate malt. The profile was well balanced. It was like chocolate malt, but it was not too boozy. Darker chocolate emerged at the finish.  Mouthfeel - The lower carbonation allowed chocolate to linger.  Overall - The chocolatey goodness lingered nicely."
3991,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.69,This is very close to a perfect NE IPA. 
3992,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.38,"Thanks to BA Dsgolovin for hooking me up with a growler of this nectar of the gods... Apperance: Pitch black with a dark, dark, brown head. Smell: Chocolate, Spices, Barrel, Coffee, Roasted malts. Taste: Cinnamon, Chili, Chocolate, Brandy, Coffee. Palate: Supersmooth and perfectly balanced. Medium carbonation. Goes down way to easy considering the abv. One of the best stouts i've yet to try. World class."
3993,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,5.0,"Can't always find this but when I do, I buy it. Rich and full bodied. Complex flavors in a superbly balanced brew. I love taking my time with this sipper. Better after warming a bit."
3994,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.33,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass canned on 7/20/21. Pours a very hazy orange yellow, with a finger plus sticky white head that leaves thick streaks of lace with excellent retention. 4.75 Aroma ripe melon, guava, gonja, mandarin, and apricot. 4.25 Taste follows cantaloupe, guava, gonja, mandarin, and apricot really balanced. 4.25 Mouthfeel is above medium, not sticky or dry, soft gentle almost creamy carbonation, and at 8.6% ABV it drinks very easy. 4.75 Overall another excellent NEDIPA from them, but because it was from them I honestly expected even better. Still excellent, just the bench moves when I get stuff from them honestly. 4.25"
3995,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.46,"Pours like motor oil. A finger a very dark brown head forms. Tight compact bubbles. Mild lacing. Everytime I go for a sip, the ring of foam sticks to the sides of the glass. Nose is delicious. Rich, robust coffee and dark chocolate. A touch of something sweet brightening it up.  Taste is coffee, chocolate, and the maple comes through now. The coffee provides a nice bitter undertone, whereas the chocolate sits somewhere in the middle between the coffee and the maple. The flavor of the maple is predominantly on the back end although it increases the overall sweetness of the brew. Really nice stuff. It does capture the feeling of chocolate chip pancakes and coffee for breakfast. Mouthfeel is fullbodied with a surprisingly active carbonation. An above mild level carbonation sitting somewhere just below medium. It has a touch of cloying quality. To be expected from a Milk Stout. Overall a stellar dessert for breakfast sort of brew by Tree House. Not too sweet, not too heavy of an ABV, the flavors come together beautifully. Well done."
3996,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.75,A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a dense finger and a half of dark tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of hte glass with minimal lacing.
3997,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,3.99,"Canned 9/29/20, consumed Nov/'20: Nose of sweet straw; fluffy white head with gold hue; full mouthfeel with soft / smooth carbonation; taste is candi sugar sweet melon with medium bitterness and a salacious bitter sweet finish."
3998,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.29,"Poured dark and thick. Aromas of oak, vanilla, whiskey, and dark chocolate. Drank very nice and smooth with the oak and dark chocolate flavors coming through well. Delicious"
3999,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.47,"Appearance - From thecan, the beer poured a cloudy orange color with a white head.  Smell - The nose smell of fresh oranges.  Taste - My first impression is tart orange with pulp. Light pine and tea qualities are present with the thick backbone. There is very little bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Talk about full-bodied, the beer had serious viscosity.  Overall - I feel like this beer would pair well with a steak."
4000,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.31,"From the 16 oz. can which was canned 09/13/18. Sampled on September 27, 2018. Murky, milky looking light amber-yellow in color with a lingering and modest white foamy head. Some lacing. The aroma emits vibrant characters of grapefruit juice, pineapple, citrus, and tropical fruits. There is a mellower toasted pale malt barley grain presence. Medium to full body. Fruitiness leads to pungent bitterness in the flavor. Still a sweet start and a lingering bitter finish. I could drink a few of these back to back."
4001,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.46,"[Original rating 2017-12-26] Draft at Armsby Abbey Worcester MA. Easily one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. I want to just sit and smell it. Pours cloudy dark gold with a medium white head. Aroma of citrus, peach, straw. Taste is tropical fruit, peach, a little bitter in the finish. Great balance. The alcohol is very well hidden, does not seem like 9.3%."
4002,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,5.0,"On tap out of a snifter, courtesy of the kind dudes at Cigar City who provided a barrel to Falling Rock Tap House during The Great American Beer Festival (10/12/12, to be exact). A - Very unique. Appears almost as an imperial stout blended with red wine. Swirl it, and you'll see what I mean. S - Apple. And brandy. Apple. And brandy. There's a stout in here somewhere. This stuff is incredibly unique. T - So, did I mentioned the word ""unique"" in the Smell description indicating this was a ""unique"" beer?? That doesn't do it justice. I've never had anything remotely close to the taste of this brew. It tastes like what it is: a fantastic imperial stout aged in apple brandy barrels. But, you really have to taste this to have a full understanding and appreciation of how good it is. This is the first beer I've ever tried that left me without an explanation for how fantastic and UNIQUE it is. Honestly, if you'd told me a delicious imperial stout would be IMPROVED by aging it in an apple brandy barrel, I'd have been very skeptical (or called you crazy). M: Thicker than I'd guessed, despite how thick it looked. But, it's not even close to being too thick. It has the ""chewiness""of a great red wine. That word ""unique"" is coming to mind...again. O - So, I assumed I'd go for many years without the opportunity to try this beer. Thank you, Cigar City guys, for the opportunity to try your most incredible product (it has to be), the opportunity to compliment your dedication to great beer, and the sweet key key chain. I told you I'd follow up with a phenomenal review on BA, so here it is. Anyway, for those of you who love imperial stouts and want to try a variation that will change your possibilities on the style, get this. If you find a way to get some, it's going to be worth it. I might end up going to Tampa solely based on this beer. And, I have no other reason to go there. Again, thanks Cigar City guys!"
4003,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.79,This rating is based on the original from a few years ago. Pours dark brown/black with exceptional thickness. The Apple Brandy melds perfectly to make this an exceptional barrel aged stout. For a number of years this was my favorite beer.
4004,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,3.75,"Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time."
4005,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.71,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into De Garde snifter.  Pours a slightly hazy orange body with a one finger white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave slight lacing, little retention.  Aromas are sour and fruit, lots of peach and lactic tartness, stone fruits, oak and sour warheads. On the tongue is straight sour warhead sour peach, stone fruit bomb, lightly funky yeast, farmhouse.  Mouthfeel is easy, smooth and refreshing. Overall a fantastic beer, one of the best sours i've ever had."
4006,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.31,"For goodness sake, let this warm up to near room temperature. Otherwise, it's a dull, muted brandy barrelled beer. Around 60-65 degrees F, it emerges into a chocolate fondue apple of a stout, still of only modest complexity, but definitely bolder and more appealing."
4007,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.94,"Delicious, all the hype well deserved. The main thing for me is the creamy feeling and how smooth the taste. I really can't say I have experienced that with any other beer."
4008,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.57,"A 11.2 fl. oz. bottle, bottled on 5th September 2016 and a best before date of 5th September 2026. Poured into a snifter glass. Appearance: Dark dark brown, near black in colour with pretty much no head and no lacing. Aroma: Vanilla, caramel, cream, chocolate, cocoa, oak and bourbon with hints of alcohol soaked raisin. Taste: Cocoa, chocolate, caramel, fudge, vanilla, bourbon soaked raisin, oak, bourbon cream with touches of roasty coffee. Mouthfeel: Creamy, full bodied with low carbonation. Overall: A very nice sipper with good creamy vanilla and bourbon flavours."
4009,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.03,"Pours a standard caramel copper color with a fluffy white head. The nose is sweet with notes of pine and grapefruit/orange dominated citrus up front. The taste has that same grapefruit taste up front that fades into a nice and caramelly malt with a satisfying just barely bitter finish. This one is sweeter than expected, but the honey really does compliment the malt flavor. It's slightly more carbonated than expected, so it's almost refreshing, and goes down very easily. Overall a good DIPA but I wouldn't say it's one of the best."
4010,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.65,"Appearance -The beer was silky black in appearance with a slight head of off-white bubbles.  Smell - Darker notes came from the notes with coffee and chocolate leading the way.  Taste - My initial impression was fudge flavored iced coffee. The coffee notes were dark, but not bitter. There was a light burn of bourbon toward the back. The fudge notes were able to linger for quite some time.  Mouthfeel - The beer was very full bodied for an oatmeal stout. It was not quite a Russian Imperial Stout in feel, but it had viscosity. The smoothness of the pour allowed the delicious fudge notes to hover on the tongue for quite some time.  Overall - I definitely enjoyed this beer on a cold summer night."
4011,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.56,"I'm not generally one for fruited stouts - adjuncts in stouts should be restricted to vanilla, cinnamon, coffee, nuts, and whatever that isn't a fruit. But, Clare's Thirsty Ale was on the top 250 for years, so I had to try it. Usually berry adjuncts come across as medicinal to me, except in sours - but this seems to be something of an exception. The raspberry is pungently present in the nose, but somehow does not have either a syrupy or astringent presence in the taste notes or mouth feel. There's also very low acidity to the berry, which is impressive - raspberry almost always imparts just a bit of acidity. Not so here, which is nice. The beer is fairly creamy in mouth feel, with loads of chocolate, and is quite smooth. No small feat for such a high ABV. There's definitely heat to the beer - I drank this on an empty stomach and found myself stumbling a bit. Oops. Still, not booze to the taste, just a bit of heat in the chest. I see exactly why this beer is so respected. I think I actually prefer it over Jam the Radar, particularly as regards format. Pretty impressive. Thank you to Franfab, who provided me with this can in the Newbies Winter Blues BIF!"
4012,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.53,"2015 bottle poured at a share last night. Beer pours dark brown in color. Not completely opaque. Small mocha head forms and dissipates quickly, probably running from the 20.5% abv (haha). Aromas of caramel, fudge, oak and booze fill my nose. Set the glass on the table a few feet away and I could still smell it. Taste is all of the above....lots of fudge, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oakiness and some definite booze. For 20.5%, I expected some heat, even with a 3 yr old beer. Drinks thicker than it looks. Coated the mouth with vanilla, caramel and booze. Overall, even with the hints of booziness there, this is still relatively smooth. Excellent beer."
4013,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.34,"Enjoyed on draft this evening at Hops Hill in Brooklyn, NY. Pours with a medium haze, fine bubble froth and ample lacing left on the glass. Pungent hopped up and citric sniff. Big, bold, complex, dank and deeply flavorful brew...10.5% well handled, but still a light burn comes to mind. Delicious, smooth, heady and well crafted concoction...savor every sip...go get some"
4014,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.22,"Drank from a 750 ml 1pt 9.4 fl oz bottle purchased from Half Time Beverage, Poughkeepsie, NY"
4015,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.42,"2016 vintage with the Purple Bowling Ball on the label, it pours pitch black color with a small tan/mocha colored head that faded faster then normal and left minimal traces of lacing. Nose is full of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, dark fruits and chocolate milk. I didn’t detect any coconut but still found this to be very complex and enjoyable to inhale. Flavor has a lot more dark fruit, toffee and sweetness to it like black cherry soda along with brown sugar and a melted Heath Bar. It almost borders on cloyingly sweet, but that aspect helps hide the 15% ABV. Like the nose I got of barrel or oaky notes, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, more dark fruits, cocoa powder, candy and chocolate milk. None of the coconut advertised on the bottle, but a dynamic profile that was a lot more balanced than I expected. A tad bit thin, even for a porter, and while it’s overall a very impressive brew it’s too sweet to drink a bomber by yourself as I struggled having it alone. A definite dessert beer to share with a few other beer lovers."
4016,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.79,Original rating
4017,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.6,from a 16 oz can 8/05/2021 into a Willi Becher pint glass.
4018,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.65,"Amazing beer. Pours black with a nice beige cap, and awesome lacing left on the glass, especially for a big stout. Nose is dominated by rich roasted malts and coffee. Taste follows the nose, but imho the dark chocolate flavors dominate the coffee. Body is fairly typical for the style, as is the carbonation. The abv is extremely well hidden for a 12% stout. This is an amazing beer, and my only wish is that I could have it more often."
4019,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.8,L: Dark mahogany and amber hues with a thin khaki head
4020,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.02,Vintage 2016. Consumed on 11/25/2020. Coffee is nonexistent and I'll guess it has faded over time. Chocolate stout notes are accented by cinnamon which is still strong. Maybe too much so. The barrel presence combined with the cinnamon spice make this a bit of a disappointment for my taste.
4021,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.74,"Know Trillium well but had not been able to get opportunity to get Headroom to date. This is a hyped release (once a year so far) and had burden of expectations. Happy to say this has lived up to the hype -- at least 2019 release. Poured from a can dated 8/1/19 to a Teku. Pours a hazy light yellow. Never one to linger on smell that but this one comes across right away with wafting a bright citrus. The taste is up there with best I have had. Notes of pineapple, orange..tropical as you would expect with this packed with Galaxy but no bite. Glad I got the max allotment..gonna have to let this last a while."
4022,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.64,"Pouring this beer from a 12 oz. can into a snulip glass, this beer pours out like a thick sunny d; bright orange. It forms a pinky width of white, creamy crown that leaves slight lacing.  Before even putting my nose to the glass, I smell juice. It’s a really delightful, clean juice. A lot like sunny d itself. Clean and bright citrus presence; like orange juice, tangerine. The taste follows suit well. This thing is a little one dimensional with the citrus juice, but it’s so good at what it does, that you can’t fault it for it. Sunny d just keeps coming to mind. So clean. The mouthfeel has a slight and balanced citrus tang to it. It’s soft, somewhat creamy; but not a hugely thick creamy and clean all the way through. No burn, just smooth clean ness.  Overall, man I see why this thing is a legend. As previously stated, it’s a little one dimensional, but that one dimensional is awesome. And every aspect of it is screaming clean, from the front to the back, the looks to the feel. This thing is hotter than my first pistol that I bought in the hood when I was 15."
4023,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.31,"Hot on the heels of King Sue, this doubly hopped version is fully Citra loaded and ready to reign supreme among all hop-commers.  Double Dry-Hopped King Sue quickly wafts over the senses with a similarly radiant citrusy perfume its predecessor. Also much like the original, a bold grapefruit and tangy orange juice fills the nose and the glass as both the beer's fragrance and appearance takes on the exact character of fresh squeezed citrus juices. Its taste hinges on agave and honey to heighten the impression of branch ripe fruit succulence. But its sugar and cereal laden sweetness quickly retreats and the hops take firm control of the middle palate. Vibrant red grapefruit, ripe tangerine, mandarin, blood orange and a hint of both lemon and lime carry a citrus heavy taste across the tastebuds, saturating each of them with its sherbet-like tang. Nearly tangy, the hops are so intense that they take on a tart citrus flavor before heading into a pleasantly bitter finish of fresh grassiness, herbaceous, and hemp-like flavor. Medium bodied and trending dry, its the fruit-centric succulence and slight starchiness from malt that prevent absolute dryness. But with absolute resinous bitterness instead, their drying effects clean the finish and usher in a long and brilliant grapefruit aftertaste. This is a world class IPA that has the ""juiciness"" of New England IPA, but with the bitterness of those of a more Midwest bitterness - again, Best of both worlds!"
4024,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.46,"Appearance - The beer poured a brown-ish black color with an off-white head crowning the pour.  Smell - Maple syrup stood out in the nose but there was some bitterness to lend a sense of balance. Taste - The maple was huge, complemented by a dry bready backbone. A bit of charred dark coffee lent a sense of balance. The sweetness fades in the finish leaving a light coffee bitterness. Mouthfeel - The body seemed a bit thin for a sweet stout, but it had stickiness. Overall - The nice thing about this mapled stout was that it was not too heavy."
4025,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.34,"Basically straight fruit juice. With the low abv on this, it should honestly be packaged in fruit juice boxes like Hi-C instead of bottles. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I like my beer to at least register some level of abv."
4026,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.74,"Pours pitch black, almost no head. "
4027,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.71,This beer out-tree houses Tree House. It was like a pineapple jumped out of the can when I popped it and punched me in the nose. Abner was my first great love by this brewer but I've discovered another. THIS is why I love beer.
4028,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.62,"16 Oz Can Poured into a tulip glass. Canned on 10/28/20 (picked up during Covid honeymoon to Vermont, I'm not complaining ;) Currently sipping while I map out this weekend's gravel cycling route, and the juices are flowing! Delicious piney, mango, & citrusy aromas tickle my nostrils upon opening the can with simple, yet visually pleasing artwork. Coloring resembles a fine amber. A refreshing (keyword Fresh) IPA that has outstanding sipping ability.  The hardest part of enjoying this fine NEIPA is the inevitable end, but the journey between the start and finish is an enjoyable one indeed! As stated on the can, best cold and fresh (just like most beers in my opinion) but I'll certainly save a can for a later date, just to try a measure decline in quality (which I don't perceive will be much). Enjoy!"
4029,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.41,"No canning date (purchased at brewery on 3/8/19; presumably canned within a week of that time) Pours a hazy dark orange huge topped with a thick, verging on creamy, white head. Great retention leaves plenty of soapy lacing, a faint, frothy cap, and an ample collar; all the appearance of a great-looking beer despite the sizable chunks of sediment floating around. Aromas of ruby red grapefruit and peach skins are intense straight away, while backing notes of orange pulp, blackberry/blueberry smoothie, and dank eucalyptus round out a bouquet that's every bit fruity as it is saturated (albeit subtly) with herbal and ‘sweeter’ hop tones. Amazing exposure of hop diversity and depth. Taste profile turns, with overripe peach now taking over and red grapefruit zest coming in not far behind alongside a dose of pulpy orange and herbal hops; lighter notes of blackberry and blueberry add further depth to the fruity profile; ample malt backbone bursts through intermittently, especially toward the finish. Mouthfeel is quietly creamy, with a lighter body but a stiff, bitter crispness and great juicy character. Slightly oily bitterness on the finish, which only adds depth and smoothness to the juicy character; effortless, elegant, unbelievably drinkable, and really just a beautiful aspect of this beer. Not your typical New England haze bomb, and certainly not your old-school IPA; this is a tweener in the best sense. Overwhelmingly hoppy and unique, this embraces the best of both worlds, with an incredible balance tying it all together. Just spectacular; I could drink this again and again."
4030,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.15,"Jet; meaty nose; cola, birch beer, A1 steak sauce, a thread of vanilla, hints of Bounty; bitter + chewy.  4 4 4.25 4 4.25 Too much licorice. Another bottle that may have been held onto for too long: the peaks of chocolate around the savoury notes hint at another beer. Still, given the reputation, disappointing."
4031,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.23,"This one pours a somewhat hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing. This smells like intensely resinous piney hops, grapefruit rind, booze, pineapple, and grapefruit. This is definitely a bruiser, and easily the booziest HF IPA I've had, which makes a lot of sense. It's quite resinous and bitter, with lots of pine and earthiness. There is a lot of juicy and citrusy type things, too, as I get grapefruit, melon, pineapple, and some lemon. There's not too much malt character, but it does finish a touch boozy. This is medium bodied, with an intense lingering bitterness, both from the hops and higher alchohol. Despite that, it's still pretty drinkable for me. I've been waiting to try this one for a long time now. It's not quite the absolute revelation I was hoping for, but I'm still really with it."
4032,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.06,"16oz can, dated 03.29.2021, poured into a stemless wine glass. The beer pours a very hazy and turbid orange color, amber hues with a foamy white head, about two fingers tall with good retention and excellent lacing. The aroma is pleasant, lots of fragrant tropical fruits, pineapple, mango, berry fruits, tangy citrus peel, some dank weediness with a nice bright floral bouquet, pale dough, lactose sugar and sweet yeast. The flavors are good, very bright and tropical, lots of orange and grapefruit, pineapple and mango puree, a bit of creaminess, berry fruits emerge as it warms with a nice floral quality, soft dank and weediness, mild earthy bitterness with lots sweet yeast, mineral water, and soft pale dough. The mouthfeel is good, coating, creamy, fluffy medium body that finishes easily, sweetly, and lightly dry. Verdict: A nice NEIPA from Other Half. Super tropical and fruit forward with nice floral qualities. It borders on being too sweet for my palate, but there is just enough earthiness and tanginess that lets this one toe the line fairly well."
4033,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.6,"2017 bottle, drank 2019. Pours dark. Aroma chocolate, bourbon & oak. Tastes amazing with the sweet chocolate, oak and bourbon. Barely taste the maple. Medium body. Incredible stout."
4034,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.49,"Had this at the Tasting to Sink all Sea Shepherds, at Moeder Lambic cellar, side by side with KBBS '14, MD #2 and yellow wax Assassin"
4035,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.77,"One of the best Cantillon beers I’ve tried. 2016 bottle poured into a stemmed bulb. Pours hazy and pulpy plum purple color. Beautiful color. Aromas of earthy grape and funk. Taste is amazing. The grapes used in this are so unique and just taste so amazing. Earthiness, funk and some hints of red wine. Feel is thick for this style. Drinks with some body. Overall, this is an amazing Lambic and one of the best I’ve had."

4038,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,5.0,"2018 bottle Poured cold, hard to a tulip. Jet black, no floaters. No head at all…starts to bubble for a ring, then peters out. Nose is a sort of light smoked cherry wood, not at all what I expected. First sips are great! The mix of bourbon barrels is very complex. You don’t get any one distinct flavor, but rather a changing swirl of sweetnesses and woods. The vanilla comes in mid-palate with a sort of vanilla bean shell earthiness, a hint of coffee-ness without the coffee. The malts are deep, robust, providing a massive foundation. Some of that cherry comes back toward the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect: Full but crisp and refreshing. Alcohol has that bourbon flavor, but no noticeable bite or warmth at this stage. As it warms, that might change. I can see why people search this out. Excellent brew!"
4039,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.09,"Had Gueuze Cantillon poured from capped-and-corked 37,5cl bottle, bottled ""06 DECEMBER 2008,"" personally imported from Paris for me in Summer 2019 by my daughter, into Teku tulip 3.0.  This late 2018 bottle pours peach-gold, almost orange. Nice near-white head is soon gone without a trace. The big sour and fruity aroma soon settles into persistent horse blanket. After a surprisingly mild start, wheat spice makes a brief appearance, before the funk and sharp but not terribly tart fruit--peach and persimmon--arrive and carry the beer to its very dry finish."
4040,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.78,I couldn’t be more lucky than to have fantastic neighbors willing to share a can of Hill F Abner. This was my first and right off the bat its smooth. Dare

4042,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.39,"Beautiful orange pour with a nice finger's thickness of white, creamy head. Smells terrific - lots of orange-y citrus notes. Taste is super clean with a ton of citrus, some resiny green notes, a bit of bitterness in the finish. Just excellent. Really drinkable, impossible to discern the 8% ABV. Would love to crush these by a fire."
4043,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.66,"Great maple, chocolate, bourbon aroma and taste. Thick motor oil mouthfeel that is truly spectacular. I think it's pretty comparable to KBS, except with the incredible maple."
4044,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,5.0,Had on tap at HFB after bottle run. Absolutely extraordinarily perfect high octane version of a English Barleywine. Had a beautiful if brief light tan head; excellent residual lacing. Rich tawny orange- ruby accented color. Like a beautiful piece teak. Both simple and then complex to light.
4045,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.65,"Appearance: Clear, light amber (unfiltered) with fluffy white head with good retention Aroma: Layered with pine leading, then Citrus & Tropical with a trailing woody/musty (some call it dank) note. Flavor & Aftertaste: Alcohol is noticeable. Citrus & resinous pine prominent with spicy notes mixed in. Aggressive bitterness on a low to moderate sweet malt backbone. Mouthfeel: Highly astringent with a lengthy dry finish. Bitterness builds and lingers well into the finish. Overall: Rated this versus other DIPA's. Thank you to BA advocate buddy for providing. I can see what the hype is all about. For fans of a DIPA, this one is top tier. Terrific layered aromas starting with pine, then citrus & tropical fruit ending with a note of woodiness/mustiness (dankness) as you work you way through it. It is aggressive bitter & astringent, so beware of that if you are adverse to those characteristics. The finish is dry and lengthy with the bitterness lingering well into the finish."
4046,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.44,"06/2014 - Massive pine, some tropical fruit, grassy aromas; flavorful, clean, bitter, sharp hoppiness all over the palate; light bitterness, with some more tropical fruit on the finish."
4047,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.97,"Fantastic beer--potentially Other Half's best among a flotilla of great IPAs. Citrus aroma explodes from the can the second you flip the top. Beer pours gold, somewhat hazy. The taste evolves, tangerine prominent, delivering both fruit and bitterness. Brilliant!"

4049,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,3.78,Solid stout here. Nice head and lace. The base beer is good enough. I don't get a great deal of smooth barrel here. Has a little bite. After taste is so so. I had another version a while ago that was much better. Can't remember the wax color.
4050,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.14,"Thanks to eyebereej for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Cigar City Brewing goblet. A: Pours a nearly clear light gold, with just a bit of chill haze. Forms a half-finger's worth of white head that fades quickly atop a very modest amount of visible carbonation. S: Lightly tart and lemony citric, with barnyard and earthy funk. Light cracker malts underneath. T: Lemony and citrusy lactic acid, with a middling amount of earthy funk. Light cracker malts. A mild yeast character with minimal black pepper flavor. A mild savoriness along with the tartness, and some Lactobacillus funk. I don’t get much, if indeed any, Brettanomyces character. It stays tart, citrusy and dry in the hang. M: Light body, low alcohol, and a good amount of carbonation sensation. O: I thought this was really enjoyable to drink, but really not much saison character. I would have pegged it as a Berliner perhaps. A nice citric lemon tartness, but the saison yeastiness, black pepper, and real barnyard funk are lacking. But if someone handed it to me blind, I'd say it was quite tasty."

4054,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.87,"Had this on tap on 12/3 at Growler Guys in Portland. A: Pours a golden orange color with minimal white head. Very small amounts of thin white lacing throughout. S: Big fruity/citrusy aromas of pineapple, orange, and guava. Milder notes of dank, piney, and earthy hops. T: Taste matches aromas well. Super juicy with fruity notes of pineapple, mango, peach, papaya, guava, orange, and tangerine followed by a very slight piney, hoppy bitterness. F: Light to medium bodied, super smooth, with a small to moderate amount of carbonation. O: Overall, this is a great TIPA. Super fruity, but not overly sweet. Very drinkable, ABV is almost entirely hidden and for 11.5-12% that is unreal. Would love to try this stuff fresh from the lines. Would definitely seek this out again."
4055,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.73,"Huge thanks to rudzud, the gem I've been trying to get for a while! 2013 Huge frothy head, pink blueberry thick head fades semi slowly with big lacing, slight hazy dark purple maroon berry juice color. Nose is incredible! Loads and loads of blueberry, fresh blueberry and aged funky, great lambic funk, earthy tart sour funk, sour lambic tart berry skin, blueberry flesh, juicy as Hell. Taste brings tons more blueberry, big berry skin, little bitter tannin, acidic funk, lambic acidic funk, funky wild acidic lambic tart earthy, blueberry seed, tart funk, delicious but tannins and acidic bite are a bit too much. Mouth is med bod, nice carb, good acidity. Overall awesome, incredible but some parts could be better."
4056,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.74,"Jet black body topped with a thick and creamy, tan colored head. Alluring aroma of milk chocolate, cocoa and vanilla; faint, boozy scent. Decadently rich, sweet flavors; milk chocolate and maple syrup; vanilla; whiskey. Heavy, silky smooth body; velvety and chewy; dull, prominent sweetness to the mouthfeel; twinge of alcohol warmth. A heady, extremely tasteful and lip smacking bit of rich porter flavor. World class all the way..."
4057,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.78,"In a can, about 6 weeks old. Pours cloudy orange with a two finger head and nice lacing. Smells like orange peels. Tastes sweet at first and then bitter pith on the back end. Creamy mouthfeel. Lives up to the hype!"
4058,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with minimal beige head. Lots of spices on aroma. Vanilla, cinnamon, bourbon. Taste is moderate to heavily sweet but not as much as regular dark lord. Nice cinnamon flavor and thankfully not a cinnamon bomb. Flavors of vanilla, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses and a hint of peppercorn on the finish. Awesome beer."

4061,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.66,"Absolutely excellent beer. Opened a 2014 vintage that had been properly cellared since purchase. Poured nice and dark. Lighter aroma of oak and bourbon. Flavors had dropped a slight bit, but came together perfectly. Nothing overly prominent, just a delicious mixture of all the flavors. Could drink this all day"
4062,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.85,"Sampled pour from a fresh 32 oz growler That indicated Amarillo hops were highlighted. Pours bRight, nearly lemon yellow and slightly hazy with a solid 2 fingers of dense head. Nose is lemongrass combined with grapefruit and a hint of bubblegum sweetness. The taste presented the sweet fruitiness apparent on the nose but was beautifully balanced by resinous hop bitterness. This is definitely one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of tasting."
4063,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.15,"Must admit, the main reason I paid 12 bucks for four of these was bc I am somewhat of an amateur scholar of paleontology, and am fond of Sue, and the science this fossil has generated.  Much to my surprise, I find it ranked 5th on pale ales? Wow. Let's have a taste then.  Certainly this is a tasty one. It's also a well deserved data point in the single hop citra club. I myself brewed two batches of single hop citra beers, one IPA, and one cream ale. Both made my top six list. Additionally, there were at least three single hop citra beers available when I bought this one.  That being said, I suspect that the craze over citra might have influenced the overall rating on this one.  And now, with all that out of the way...  This beer is quite good, damn tasty if I quantify it appropriately. Citra stands out, but the overall character of a pale ale isn't lost, although the line between pale ales and IPAs isn't all that distinct in all cases.  Verdict? Go for it. This is damn fine beer."
4064,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,5.0,Holy moly. Cycle just Scooped me up. The hype is real on this one. First thing I tastel is chocolate followed by vanilla and ending with some strawberry goodness. You need to try this ASAP.
4065,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.46,"Poured from a bottle (2016 vintage) into a taster glass L: pours a deep, dark brown with basically no head that completely dissipates after a few seconds. Minimal lacing, nice abv-expected legs S: rich, deep chocolate with roasted coffee aroma fills the nose. Brownies, chocolate chips, chocolate cake, well roasted black coffee, raisins, some bourbon. Not much abv heat here, will revisit once it’s warmed somewhat. Dark caramel T: follows the nose beautifully, like an amazing sip of coffee and chocolate ice cream. Rich chocolate flavor opens (again thinking fudge brownies, chocolate chips) moving to this great black coffee note that asserts itself and remains through the medium-long finish. Slightly bitter, find it fitting with the coffee flavor. Get raisins as well, bourbon, some notable barrel character. Just slightly thin, what’s holding me back from calling this world-class. Very close! F: medium body (knock here, would have liked it thicker), low carbonation, quite smooth oatmeal doing it's job O: a serious BA stout that delivers handily on the nose and palate. Small ding on the mouthfeel, would have liked it a bit thicker. That said, an amazing beer that seers clear of sweet while providing a rich, decadent experience"
4066,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.8,"on nose is oak, vanilla, caramel, leather, bourbon, and very subdued booze. palate is massive sugary dark fruits. plum, cherry, fig, spice, raisin, brown sugar roasted almonds, marshmallow, caramel, vanilla, bourbon. the complexity is rich in this one, and im probably not able to pick out all the fruity and spiced notes because this is a style i dont drink often. regardless it is clear that the base beer integrates beautifully with bourbon character, and the overall result is immensely complex and smooth - an unbelievably delicious offering."
4067,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.19,"Pitch black to dark brown with a slight hint of Ruby when held to the light. Topped with a half finger of rusty dark brown beige head.  It smells of umami so he sauce toasted notes, chocolate and hints of wine and oak barrels. I also get a black liquorice on the nose and some allspice. The taste is of chocolate, coffee, Coco dust a hint of scotch and bourbon oak. I got black liquorice again and some of the spice comes through and soy sauce. Slightly sweet very little char. The thick and oily body is lightened with hints of barrel and oak. Its really smooth and certainly covers the Abv.  I got this in Redding California June 10, 2019 and I’m drinking it here at home. This was batch 01 from 2018."
4068,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.31,"I remember this being kinda boozy. Huge tropical fruit and dank hops. Somewhat thick mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Great, but not amazing like people say."

Off white head rising maybe a nudge over a finger's length.  Smell: light lemon skin scent.  Taste: Light smooth malts. Lemon and slight grass. Touch sweet of pinkgrapwfruiit. Mouth: Slight sticky with medium carbonation.  Overall: Very good brew and borderline IPA like. I say grab it, Salud!"
4071,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.46,2 month old can. An extra from a recent trade. Way passed its prime. Malty mess. Very surprised how fast these fade away. I've had some really great NEIPAs with 3 months on them and never taste this off... Damn shame.
4072,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.59,"It is truly delicious. A little bit foamy, the foam spilled a little. Look: Black with an inch thick mocca colored head.

4073,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.3,"Bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. Deep golden to orange colour, moderate white head. Very nice hoppy aroma, fruity and herbal notes. Intense hoppy flavour, but not too bitter. Fruity and spicy notes, well balanced."
4074,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.38,Glows a beautiful golden orange hue - check
4075,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.74,This is the highest rating I believe I've ever given a beer. IMO this is better than Juice machine and KJ. So soft and so mild compared to the overly hoppy stuff they've churning out. No hop burn whatsoever. So rich and delicious. It's like Honey Dew Melon Sorbet in a glass.
4076,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.0,"De Labirratorium. En copa Teku. En cena de Nochebuena, con solomillo con pasas + gambas. De lo mejor que he probado de esta gente, de la que no soy muy fan la verdad. En esta al menos el suave toque a albaricoques logra contener la acidez y hace que resulte fácil de beber. No obstante, muy cara para lo que ofrece blancas + jamón + queso de oveja."
4077,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.27,"Review is based on the bottle release, which has been the best of the 3 coconut releases thus far. Pitch black pour recedes to a small mocha head. No lacing. Smell is coconut lather - not sweet nor perfume-laden, but very aggressive. Taste follows, with rich coconut and vanilla flavors throughout. Barrel is a bit subdued. It's whiskey forward at first, but quickly mellows, and lacks that oak or charred wood complexity on the finish. Alcohol presence is minimal, but that 14.5% will hit you before you finish. Mouthfeel is slick; each sip quickly subsides, leaving a coconut-meets-brown-sugar residue reminiscent of a cookie or granola bar. All in all it's a great beer, and real treat. I could drink an entire bottle but for my palate it's best split. That said, it's far from my favorite variant (S'mores and Coffee maple are clearly ahead of this one for me), and I probably won't actively seek out more."
4078,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.65,"Opaque yellow with white foam. Sweet cuts is musty in the absolute best way.  Nelson's a crisp back end to pervading OJ of Citra and Galaxy -- in that way more complex than other Monkish IPAs. Nelson doesn't read as usual, like a weak basil. Odd mix comes off very well. Fine bubbles, under carbed. The Nelson makes a hard finish."
4079,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.42,Look: Clear Purple with medium pink fizzy head that recedes immediately. Has medium carbonation.
4080,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,3.12,"I had the original by the tulsa boys. I thought and still think it’s the best beer I ever had. This new one is a let down. First smell was that apple juice dominated over everything else. That was odd and off putting compared to the original. First taste was rewarding that it seemed balanced like the original. Then the big let down came into play. The mouth drenching aftertaste of apple juice plagued my mouth. This is not a barreled apple brandy. If it is it is way over powering of the bomb like base that seems balanced at first. The actual brandy alcohol seems even lost to me from the apple domination. Is this a bad beer? No. Is this the best beer I ever had ? No. I even doubt the 12% abv and would rate lower around 10%. I took no measurements though. It’s just not as rich and balanced as the original, plain and simple. Considering this is my favorite beer ever. Please try again. I will applaud the extra effort."
4081,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,5.0,One of my few perfect 5's. Better than Fou' Foune methinks. The scent is unreal. I kept sniffing and sniffing. The beer is sour but not an acid bomb. The interplay with the apricots is fantastic. Apricot is probably my favorite fruit in any sour. Truly a beer worth seeking out.
4082,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.94,"HUMONGOUS thanks to justing for sharing this. who would've guessed that i'd get to taste it again the next day (thanks dave)!!! Enjoyed on 7/27 at Top Hops at a mini tasting with some awesome BAs. Hell of a night and kicked off a wonderful weekend of beer tasting! Ticked from a 2oz pour and then adjusted my thoughts the next day from a larger pour. a - Has that Hunah look. Coats the glass with a single swirl. No head, but just a gorgeous beer. s - Smells like Hunah but with a strong raisin and fig. Some booze and some brandy. Basically Hunah with some fruitiness a la sangria. t - OH WOW! Hunah extreme!!! Figs with apple brandy. You get the peppers on the finish but the fruitiness of the brandy just pushes this amazing beer to the next level. Truly amazing. m - Smooth and creamy. Wonderful like a milkshake of amazing beer. o - Wow, what can I say? This beer is simply amazing. On Friday when I sampled it, I said I would do dirty things for this beer...and then the next day, I traveled 2 hours to another tasting (which was before a third tasting in 2 days) and this was a pleasant surprise at the 2nd tasting. I guess the dirty things means dealing with NYC transit in horrendous heat and downpours and then having to leave one of the most epic tastings to go to another tasting. What a weekend!!! Not sure how long these growlers will hold out, but drink them up...as of a few days ago, this was the nectar of the gods."
4083,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.42,"Pours deep black with no head and minimal lacing. Aroma is oak, bourbon but don’t get the maple I expected.  Taste is very solid and I do get maple in the aftertaste that lingers. I will say the alcohol is very well hidden.  While I enjoyed this beer, mouthfeel did not live up to the rest of this beer.  Overall this is very solid beer from Jackie o’s. I loved the lingering maple on the back end of the sip. Barrel comes in nicely and easy drinking for an 11.0 percent beer. Mouthfeel holds this beer back. That being said, a very good beer"
4084,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.38,"B2. This was a very nice beer, although it did not meet hype. Beer was flat when poured. The nose was all fruit, the taste was jammy goodness. Overall its very nice, kinda sucked that it was flat, and side by side i much preferred fou"
4085,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.71,This 2013 bottle was cellared and cool for many years. 
4086,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,3.96,"L: Hazy yellow with a thick head and great lacing. S: Pine resin, a touch of cheese, diesel, pineapple, juicy fruit. A candylike malt aroma as well. T: Mild bitterness, big juicy hop flavors of tropical fruit, peach, and pine. The malt has a candylike flavor that reinforces the hop flavors. F: Medium/full body, lowish carb, very Lush. Overall: A really good beer that is just a little short of being great due to some off notes from the hops. I get a bit of staleness that is not due to the beers age (canned two weeks ago), but other than that it is really great."
4087,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.24,"Poured into a snifter. An opaque acorn yellow color with a medium sized soapy head. Blueberries, papaya, and tangerines on the nose. The taste was typical Mosaic (to me) with all the above flavors. Slightly sweet and the malt was restrained. The beer had some heft from the lactose, but not at milkshake level. Creamy, smooth feel. Outstanding."
4088,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.42,Had a taster at the brewery. Poured very dark with a sweet aroma of vanilla and spice and just a hint of chile. The flavor is extremely well balanced. The bourbon barrel and vanilla provide a sweetness that is well complimented with cinnamon and a bit of chile heat and flavor. The tequila barrel shows up in just the right amount on the finish.
4089,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.33,"Pours black, significant brown head. It definitely has that milk stout aroma - tangy/lactose and some alcohol. Taste is roasty with dark chocolate. Some umami/meatiness/soy sauce as well. Feel is somewhat creamy. Overall, one of my favorite milk stouts."
4090,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.53,"Very tasty pale ale. Pours hazy yellow with a thick white head. Aroma is solid hop floral and layered. Taste follows, many layers of hop floral flavors and mild bitterness. Feel is excellent for a pale ale, rich and full mouthfeel. Overall a fantastic hop forward pale ale."
4091,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.75,"Did this, 2020 vintage, and the original back to back, because quarantine. Dark clear brown, no head. Smells strongly of bourbon, wood, toffee, raisin, brown sugar, barley, coconut, vanilla and caramel. Taste is so deep, really get the barrel character in a rich way, with booze, flavoring and wood all dynamic, with rich toffee/caramel, molasses, and everything from the smell, especially dark fruits. Feel is smooth, very warm, rich, sneaky thick, and full. Like the original but with more barrel and darker, barley more present too. Best american barleywine I have had The wife loved it"
4092,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.39,"Outstanding beer, and very different. Actually a very similar experience to Big Bird, which I lucked into two years ago as I picked up a flat of Trillium beers in Fort Point on our way to Cape Cod for a bi-annual multi-family trip. I think this one is actually more polished and tasty, fresh, than Big Bird was. But the amazing hop experience is similar. Looks like a muddy pineapple juice, but the aromas and (to a just slightly lesser degree) flavors cover just about every hop-related note I love about hoppy beers. Citrus, pith, berries, mango, musky wine grapes, dank hemp, tropical fruit, wheat biscuit, sugared grapefruit. Absolutely phenomenal. Grassy, but not overly so, which is a nice departure from most NE IPAs. Really nice level of sweetness, as well, and zero green astringency, even fresh, which distances this beer from Big Bird. Feel is a little thin, but that doesn’t take anything away from the amazing, complex, and harmonious nose and tongue. Amazing that you can throw an ungodly amount of different hops together and get such a wonderful end result."
4093,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.96,"There is depth to this that's pretty incredible.  I can smell licorice, bittersweet chocolate and musty whiskey barrel. The taste is sweet with chocolate, cherry, wood and liquor. It has a medium mouthfeel with a small amount of bubbly carbonation.  The finish starts complex with the licorice, chocolate and cherry, then fades to a long dry bittersweetness. Wow, what a beer.  It's the most complex stout I've had but the flavors are never muddled; always clear.  I give it a 5.9 out of 6."
4094,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.33,"Pours a hazy straw color, ample foamy head. Great citrus aroma mixes with a little pine. Very flavorful, slightly dank with a good dose of bitterness. Appropriate carbonation. Overall a delicious ipa, a bit too west coast for me. 4-14-21"
4095,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.75,"2019 vintage. 750ml bottle purchased off the shelf for $24.49. I tried to let this get closer to room temperature before drinking it, but it might still be kind of cold. Look: Has a beautiful appearance. Viscous and black with a gorgeous, albeit small, brown head with nice lacing. Very compact, thin foam with good retention. Really looks gorgeous. Smell: The nose on this beer suggests that it is decadence in a glass. Up front - chocolate galore. Rich, dark baker's chocolate. All of the adjuncts meld so well together with the imperial stout to create a fully integrated, rich aroma. The finish is warm cinnamon and vanilla. It's hard to pick out the ancho chile in the nose. It's a bit fruity on the front end, so maybe that is coming from the ancho chile which foodies describe as a ""spicy raisin"". The aroma on this beer reminds me of a spiced chocolate cookie. What I find so enticing about the aroma is that it has a creamy richness to it. There is a nice nuttiness in the aroma also - reminds me of candied cinnamon almonds. A touch of alcohol on the nose. Taste: It's so tasty, complex, and delicious. It's really not very sweet, yet from the list of adjuncts one might jump to call this a ""pastry stout"". Very malty, the flavor is reminiscent of ovaltine or an adult hot chocolate (mexican hot chocolate flavors, for sure). The finish is bold and robust, the slightly bitter roasted malt flavors linger long on my palate since the beer has such a full mouthfeel. There is a bit of acidity on the finish, and it works just fine here (perhaps welcomed). And there is warm spice on the finish from the cinnamon and ancho chile. Touch of black licorice on the finish as well. Feel: The mouthfeel is luscious. This is the kind of thickness that imperial stout brewers dream to achieve. Carbonation is spot on. Overall: An extremely well made adjunct imperial stout. You can tell that their base beer must be amazing, adjuncts aside, because the adjuncts can only enhance the base beer and cannot be used to cover up potential flaws. 11.5% ABV is extremely well hidden. How do they achieve such a thick mouthfeel? I used my champagne bottle stopper to store this back in the fridge for a day of two longer....if I cannot drink it fast enough, can I make a super delicious beer ice cream with it?"
4096,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.79,"Rating is for B1 poured 8 Wow didn't think this was going to live up to the hype, but I thought it was geuzey, rich, acidic, but not over the top. Had some citrus qualities. For the price I think DDG B2 is still a better get but I think if it was straight up I would take this. Great american styled geuze, lambic. One of a kind."
4097,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.85,"Basically a perfect IPA. Aroma, mouthfeel, taste/aftertaste... all balanced beyond comprehension. One of the few beers which lives up to the hype. One of the best beer you'll ever have."
4098,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.31,2082
4099,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.3,"Thanks, Shane! Pours a hazy red color with an off-white head. Excellent cherry aroma to go with the lactic acidity from the base beer. Mild straw and oak, a bit of grass, too. Cherry flavor is very well pronounced. Nice and dry with lemon, lemon zest, and a pleasant tartness. There is a little bit of oak and a mild acetic note on the finish."

4101,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.38,"Great beer. However, I still felt somewhat disappointed considering its hype and trade value. GoM and Beyond Good & Evil were better offerings in my opinion."
4102,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.52,Had this on tap at the Churchills sour fest. Really nice bright color. Can smell the funk and the sour taste was great. The apricots weren't super strong but it was really sour.
4103,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.29,"2019 batch, drank fairly fresh. (Significantly better than the 2015/2016 batches, which had a faint of maple.) Not overly sweet, but just enough of maple with the barrel presence."
4104,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.48,"Pours golden and hazy. Immediate fruity aroma fills the room. The beer starts as nice as it smells, but then ends a little empty and bitter. This is my favorite of the Hill Farmstead beers I've tried, but not my favorite beer. Still worth buying when it's available."
4105,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.5,"Hazy yellow with a finger of frothy head. Nose is heavy citrus: lemon and orange, mixed some tropical mango fruit and floral notes. Taste is all citrus, more lemon and orange. Feel is fantastic, light but creamy and full bodied, crisp finish, not overly dry. One of the best hazy IPAs I've had, but I'd probably still give the nod to King JJJuliusss."

4107,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.59,Poured from Crowler into pint glass 1 day after canning Look - Pale orange. Large bubbled head with thin lacing. Classic NE style IPA look.
4108,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.41,"Bottled on 1-12-21. A - Opaque dark golden orange color with frothy lacing that sticks to the sides of the glass. S - Citrus, pineapple, mango, orange, spicy / peppery fruit rind, sweet red grapefruit. Overall aroma is aggressive, dank, and aromatic. The smell has some chalky / pithy, green hop pellet character as well. T - Juicy and dank up front with strong tropical fruit presence: orange, pineapple, mango, apricot, and ends with a sweet grapefruit bitterness. Lots of sweetness over top of assertive bitterness to round things out on the backside. Nice lingering bitterness.  M - Thick, chewy, frothy, and leaves a dry tongue along with a wet mouth. O - Packed full of flavor, dank, aromatic, and frothy - this is like an aggressive fruit smoothie. Recommended."
4109,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.52,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a very pleasant vanilla and bourbon. Taste is also a very pleasant smooth bourbon and vanilla.
4110,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.51,"Full bodied and hoppy enough that it could pass as a west coast IPA, though cleaner. So clean. Citrus notes up front. A hint of tropical notes pair with sharp lemon, lime, and grapefruit/grapefruit peel. A streak of piney, resinous, herbal, hoppy bitterness characterizes the lengthy and balanced finish. The whole experience is very smooth, somehow dry yet juicy, and incredibly crisp and clean. One of the better pale ales I've ever had."
4111,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.02,"Look: Gold, translucent and a little cloudy. A bone white head that almost entirely disappears but for a thick round around the edge of the glass. A lot of visible carbonation.  Smell: Fresh squeezed lemon and lime juice, juicy Granny Smith apple, some white vinegar,"
4112,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.15,"Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2017 edition. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave light wisps. S - Aromas of heavy maple syrup, cocoa, bourbon barrel. No discernable alcohol. T -Taste is similar to the nose with loads of maple sweetness and good vanilla and light chocolate. Good cocoa and sugars. Pleasant. M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, crisp, bright. Could be better and fluffy. O - Overall this was a very solid imperial stout. Light barrel along with light chocolate. The maple is really sweet and oppressive. Serving Type: bottle"
4113,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.58,"2019 bottle poured into a DFH tulip. Very dark brown to black body topped by a tan head. Smell is of chocolate, cinnamon, peppers, bourbon and vanilla. Wonderfully complex as is the taste with the peppers really hitting the palate. Mouthfeel was a little thin but maybe I've been spoiled by chewier British Barleywines. A superb sipping imperial stout."
4114,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.25,L - Dark as a Coke. 1-inch tan head.
4115,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.34,"2016 vintage; drank 4/21/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Black appearance.  Minimal dark tan head; minimal lace.  Dark roast coffee bean & chocolate syrup notes in the nose.  Medium thick, smooth mouthfeel.  Cream, chocolate syrup & dark roast coffee bean flavors up front; vanilla & bitter dark chocolate notes on the finish. Faint oak notes emerged as this warmed  Flavorful as hell, if a bit busy...delicious all the same."
4116,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,3.92,"Well here it is. Review number 5,000, quite an accomplishment (pats self on back). I'd like to thank beer advocate for being THE resource for all things beer. Also a shout out to the world's greatest trader, woodychandler, whose vast contributions make this possible. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has an orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, pine. Taste is pine, resin, hints of citrus and alcohol, considerable bitterness. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall it's a good beer, but it didn't meet my expectations."
4117,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.58,"Crowler, shared with friends on 5/26 - Citraquench'l pours a light, attractive yellow-orange. It looks a bit like Tang, actually, plus carb! It smells fantastic - sweet and full of citrus. The taste and mouth feel are light and refreshing, with lots of orange and citrus. It's also fairly yeasty, chewy, and hoppy - though not bitter. I really like this beer. This would easily be a go-to summer beer were it in my distribution."
4118,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.44,Tons of coffee as expected. Get a little dark chocolate but the coffee really takes over. Great mouthfeel as most TH stouts have. The only negative is there was a sugary after taste that wasn't pleasant. I prefer double shot over this one.
4119,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,3.85,"A bit thanks to Tomme and crew for bringing this along to our tasting. Poured from the bottle into a tasting snifter. No gushing due to Tomme's expert bottle opening skills. Appearance: The beer pours a very cloudy red and golden color. The color is a bit weird to be honest. Smell: Some nice fruity cherry notes right off the bat. There is some sour notes as well, just a touch medicinal. Taste: Sweet and tart cherries. Sour, but not overly so. There is a good amount of sweetness to balance out the sour flavors. The finish is slightly bitter with a mild herbal note. Mouthfeel: Medium body with tingly carbonation and a dry finish. Overall: This was yet another good sour from Lost Abbey. I enjoyed the fruit notes. The fact that it wasn't too sour was a nice break for the tongue. I wouldn't search this one out again given the difficulty."
4120,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.81,"'16 batch, I think. This one pours a dark silky looking black, with a small head, and just a little bit of lacing. Smells just absurd- honey, bourbon, maple sugar, oak, vanilla, fruity coffee, dark chocolate, etc. This is one of the luxurious beers I've ever had. There's just a ton going on here, and everything is in perfect balance and harmony, which is impressive. The coffee used here is not bitter in the slightest, with fruity and chocolatey overtones, like chocolate-covered cherries. I also get bourbon, honey, and maple. The bourbon is sweet and doesn't really add any heat to this, at all. There's creamy vanilla, a hint of earthy tobacco and light cinnamon. This is absurdly tasty. The mouthfeel on this is so killer, so creamy and balanced, like drinking silk. The carbonation level is lower. This is probably the best barrel aged porter out there. It's nearly perfect."
4121,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.55,Poured from can /OH Roc release 4/19. 
4122,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.96,"The most under rated brewery in St. Louis and this is one of their best offerings. I look forward to sharing it with my family every Christmas. It our black with mocha foam and taste like spicy Mexican chocolate, goes great with smoked ribs and watching football. Looking forward to the barrel aged version in the spring."
4123,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.31,"A - Hazy medium orange color with very sticky lacing. S - Juicy peach and passionfruit slams the nose. The nose is pretty awesome overall. T - Dank, juicy with a little but of spice. Peach, passionfruit with a little bit of citrus. The fruitiness carries from start to finish and ends on the sweeter side with very slight bitterness. M - Full body with chewiness and a wet finish on the tongue. O - Trillium has this one dialed in to the sweet spot."
4124,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.45,"Had on tap at the brewery Amazing velvety, palate-coating mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carb. Quite similar to Speedway Stout, but less aggressive on the booziness. At over 13% ABV, this is dangerously drinkable and tastes more like 9%. Flavors and aromas are definitely on the sweeter side, and mostly accentuate the coffee character. The coffee is not stale in the least. This is the first non-hoppy Trillium offering I've had and am very impressed.... more impressed than with most of their hoppy offerings, actually 89/100"
4125,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,3.59,"This is for 2018 and reviewing for the way the current stout game is. The old school back Tuesday is a legendary beer that was a game changer for high abv stouts. Unfortunately compared to stuff now it is extremely thin and way too boozy to be enjoyable. There are some good characteristics of bourbon, sweetness, and fudge. When there weren’t as many options I can see why this beer was great. I don’t know if my pallet has changed or the beer landscape has changed, maybe a little bit of both. There are a wide variety of better ba stouts in smaller formats that are more enjoyable in all aspects right now to have this again unless it was a really well aged bottle."
4126,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.4,"Bottle at share. Hazy, milky pour, pale golden , relatively flat. Big stone fruit aroma, light tartness. Bright, sharp nectarine flavors, tartness is instant, but levels off. Excellent."
4127,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,5.0,I first tried Zombie Dust when a friend brought it to my house about 6 years ago. His daughter went to college in Indiana and brought it home for him. Wow. This beer really turned me onto IPAs. I was lucky enough to get another 6 pack of Zombie Dust last week and I am savoring every sip. Really really great.
4128,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,5.0,Poured into a pint glass from a growler filled the same day (Aug 10). Opaque and deep. Medium-bodied for an NEIPA and pungent in a piney/musky sort of way. Tasted like the apotheosis of the style. This is special.
4129,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.64,"Canned May 25th, consumed on June 4th L: Pours a hazy gold. Not too special to look at. "
4130,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.75,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler L: pours a deep, dark black/brown with a minimal very loud dark brown head that fades immediately. Leaves some nice brown abv-appropriate legs with each sip. No visible carbonation, some floaties S: seriously rich and inviting. Tons of chocolate, vanilla, coconut, caramel. Like a warm double fudge brownie with bourbon caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream T: follows the nose well, rich and decadent flavors that do a great job playing off of each other. Chocolate leads, with a gently rising wave of vanilla and coconut flavor playing off of that stout base. Abv there but appropriately, doesn’t override the beer F: very smooth, viscous body. Heavy- body, low+ carbonation, very nicely warming with no abv burn O: a serious dessert stout, delivers exactly what you expect and doesn’t shy away. The flavor is incredibly rich without becoming overly sweet, body is appropriately think, abv works well. A excellent beer all around"
4131,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.79,"This one pours a lightly hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing. This smells like funky pear, golden honey and citrus, oak, white wine, green apple, vanilla, and barnyard. This is basically perfect stuff here. It's so well balanced - all the different complex flavors meld together perfectly into exactly what I think of when I think of American saison. There's some funky honey and citrusy flavors, along with tart white wine and grape skin, cider, barnyard funk, but mild, and oak and vanilla. There's a lot going on, and it's all good. This is light bodied, clean and fluffy, with a great drinkability, and such a soft and clean mouthfeel. This is as good as it gets outside of HF saisons for me. This is awesome."
4132,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.2,Golden yellow and slightly hazy. Really nice hoppy aroma. Has a nice mouth feel with balanced carbonation and initial hoppiness. Unfortunately it finishes a bit bitter for my taste. Still really like it when I want the bitterness but isn’t an everyday drinker in my book.
4133,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.45,"750 ml bottle drank at the Brewery in Brussels. poured into Cantillon 25cl stemmed glass pours a bright clear orange / peach color, thin white head that fades. nice pleasant aroma of appricots, mild tartness. similar taste, not overly sour and refreshing to drink. thin bodied, lively carbonation works for it."
4134,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.75,"Bottle aged 2 years - 2/2019 drank 2-2021. Dark roasted malt, boozy barrel, mellow coffee, dark chocolate and a nice mouth coating that lingers. Everything about this one comes together even more after it ages."
4135,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.98,"Just a perfect expression of the NE IPA. Big body, huge citrus and melon nose. Slight bitterness to balance the sweet body. Slightly dry. Amazing beer at about 3 weeks old."
4136,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.69,"This massive beer has been in my cellar for almost a year. The super high ABV would allow this beast to age for several more years. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A semi-hard pour produced a one finger head that dissipated quickly. The beer is SRM 37 a dark brown nearly black beer that is opaque. The has carbonation bubbles pooling in the middle of the beer. Overall a good appearance. With high ABV I did not expect to see a lasting head or lacing.  A very dense rich dark chocolate and espresso aromas are what I initially smell. Additional aromas are bready, vanilla, oak, yeast, dark roasted malts, earth, and raisins.  A very decadent coffee and chocolate flavor with dark roasted malts, earthy, wood, earth, vanilla, raisins, bready and yeast flavors.  The mouthfeel of the beer is hot and chewy.  The body of the beer is full, medium carbonation, and a full linger finish.  This beer surprises me, the massive flavors with a delicate touch in a strong beer. The beer flavors are just off the charts. When I drink other beer that says hey this coffee or chocolate I expect to taste the flavors of the beer and not a hint or just a note. The amazing, flavorful, and outstanding beer should be a must for a stout lover."
4137,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.35,"Clear amber brown. No head. Huge toffee, a little vanilla, a little sherry and clear earthy hops in the nose. Sweet tasting — almost amaretto-like — with cherry, vanilla, toffee, some definite hop bitterness and very strong alcohol burn. Delightful chewy, sticky mouthfeel. Definitely a special concoction. Would love to be able to afford more than a two-ounce pour."
4138,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.29,"Poured from the can into a tulip. Huge beer, but pretty easy drinking considering the ABV. Tropical fruit, minimal bitterness, solid mouthfeel. Really solid triple IPA!"
4139,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,3.8,"2018 draft from the tap room. I've had a lot of great coffee beers and it's one of my favorite adjuncts, but this was almost straight coffee for me with little barrel, enough to the point that I did not feel it was worth drinking this over coffee. Just my opinion, but I know a lot of others feel differently - just check the rating and previous reviews. Love Bottle Logic, but just wasn't feeling this beer."
4140,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.44,"Canned on 1/03/17, ‘Year of the Fog’.  Pours a creamy pale yellow, a familiar color for those who have had anything from the Foggy series. Hardly any lace, with a nice lace of frothy white foam. The aromas here are a combination of stone fruit, melon, and pineapple. Slightly tropical, but not as in your face as many other juice bombs of the same style. A perfect melding of hop varieties here. More stone fruit, hints of passion fruit, and a pretty dry finish. Honestly a lot of similar qualities to a dry white wine. Smooth, creamy, medium carb and medium body. A true a Monkish classic."
4141,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.35,"2020 vintage  Pours a jet black. Caramel head dissipates completely. Nose is of bourbon layered with vanilla, molasses, and spice from the rye. Marshmallow starts to come through as it warms. Taste starts off sweet from the rye and finishes dry due to the rye. The palate is left with dark chocolate and vanilla from the barrel. Taste initially starts out viscous as milk, but a cola like fizz thins out the beer. Overall, very impressed with this. Really like the showcasing of the barrels with some additional sweetness and spice."
4142,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.47,"2018 Bottle. Typical deep dark brown-black appearance with minimal foam around only edge of glass. Very nicely balanced sweet taste up front, with coconut coming out towards the end (and especially so as it warms). There's a good amount of chocolate presence here as well. Bourbon and booziness are well integrated also. Really good mouthfeel. Leaves the lips sticky after a few sips.  A lot of coconut beers make you feel like you're tasting Banana Boat suntan lotion (like Last Buffalo in the Park). This beer however doesn't do that. Coconut is there but because of it's well integrated with chocolate and bourbon sweet flavors, it's is just right."
4143,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.68,Appearance - The beer poured an inky black with dark brown foam clinging to the sides of the glass.  Small - The nose radiated sweet malts and booze. There was no hint of bitterness.  Taste - My first thought was that I had a chocolate malt from a mom & pop ice cream shop. Chocolate malt started then the booze finished. There were even notes of dark chocolate. The finish came in the form of sweet malty bourbon.  Mouthfeel - The beer was full bodied with little carbonation and the stickiness that aligned with sweet profile. Overall - I was caught off guard by how much I like this one.
4144,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.79,"A pitch black pour with virtually no last head. Just a thin ring of brown and off-white foam around the rim of the glass. The nose is intensely floral with a concentrated maple syrup aroma. I love that smell and I can't stop sniffing it. The drinking hits with big waves of lovely chocolate malt upfront. The mouth feel is very noticeable with just a thick, and full bodied feel that really coats the mouth and lingers well after each sip. Despite the nose the main flavor on the drinking is the coffee. Big and roasted coffee grinds that finish nicely bitter. I'm mostly getting the syrup note on the finish but its very pleasant and not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated it to be or what the nose suggests. Additional notes of caramel, brown sugar, smoke, charred oak, burnt toast, vanilla, and molasses. Despite it's feel and abv the brew is super drinkable and I'm starting to feel it. Overall, WOW, just fucking wow. I love everything about this beer. Its big and brash but yet very refined with some many flavors going on. This is why the nbs bif is so worth it. A borderline 5 for me players. I could drink buckets of this."
4145,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.27,"Very good oatmeal stout, solid and tasty but a little disappointing considering the high expectations I had for this one. It’s supposed to be ranked #3 on BA but I found it a little uninspiring. 2017 edition printed on bottle. Pours a thick black opaque color with just a little film of tan head and minimal scant lingering lacing. Smells outstanding, great dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, malt, toffee, bourbon, oak, nuttiness and a little raisin. Taste follows the nose, but not quite as rich or flavorful as I was expecting. Almost like a flatter regular coffee stout. Lacked some depth and complexity. Not as creamy or smooth as most oatmeal stouts either, but still had a nice velvety mouthfeel with good carbonation. As the beer warmed the alcohol became a little more noticeable, both in the aromas and taste. I enjoyed this one but preferred the other beers from this series."
4146,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.5,Batch 7 drank on 12/29/17 Really a wonderfully done beer. The barrel comes through perfectly and that HF funk is totally present. I’d have to assume Chardonnay is the wine barrel with the nice lighter citrus coming through. Lemon and white peach and barnyard hay are all perfectly balanced. Lovely offering from the Hill
4147,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,"A disproportionately gargantuan blast of tangerines is followed up by notes of mango, raw papaya, grass jelly, and even more sweet citrus. Just a disclaimer, I'm having a really hard time writing this review as I drink because this drinks absurdly smooth and easy. There's a hint of biscuit-y malt toward the back which neatly keeps all the aromas from running amok. Stupid is as stupid does, or in this case, Mosaic tastes as Mosaic smells. Nice sweet citrus up front, accentuated by huge notes of tropical fruit and just a hint of earthiness. The malt along with the grapefruit rind bitterness once again plays a mediating role as it re-primes your tongue for sip after sip after... oh look, my beer's gone already. The body on this one is a little more substantial than the beers I've been drinking from North of where this is brewed and far Northwest from where this is brewed; medium-bodied with an almost chewy consistency. Slight creamy initial mouthfeel with no booze burn whatsoever."
4148,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.3,"Appearance - The beer poured a golden yellow color with a white head. Smell - The nose was not big, but had notes of citrus and honey.  Taste - The initial was bright and spicy orange. The honey sweetness was mild and stayed in the background with light minty notes. The orange stays strong in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - The beer was very full bodied with little about it being mild.  Overall - This is an excellent example of the style."
4149,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.64,"L - Hazy orange with murky body and two fingers of white head S - Orange juice and bitter hop juice explosion. Some pine, lemon zest, and grapefruit too T - Also an eruption of oj, bitterness, mango, grapefruit.  F - Soft and calm. High drinkability O - One of the best pale ales out there"
4150,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.52,Finally had a chance to try this after looking to get a growler full for years! Small bottle run took place and I got a couple :). Solid offering from Alpine direct instead of the Alpine/Green Flash partnership... :(
4151,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.3,"Rated as 2017. Waited too long. Smell is still there. Although the taste is not. It is not a bad beer by any means, just missed out on drinking it fresh."
4152,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.62,"Sitting on my back deck in the cold, last vestiges of winter. I have a couple more cellaring, so figured to try this before the warm weather hits consistently. 2018 bomber poured cellar temp to a tulip glass. Nose is subtle vanilla, bourbon, light toastiness. Color is black, which pours with a three finger mocha head that burns fast to a ring with lots of lacing. First sips follow the nose, but with stronger bourbon, more toasty coconut,and barrel. Balanced impeccably. Slightly sweet with a full, creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol hides well, but has a slight warming later. Excellent base stout flavors. Not sure it will warm up, considering it’s about 30 degrees on the deck. Buy it when you see it."
4153,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.62,"2013 vintage; pours a murky brown. Smells of sherry, raisins, caramel, brown sugar. Flavors of dark caramel, sherry, chocolate, brown sugar, a touch of bourbon and oak barrel. Sweet but very well balanced and finishes with drying oak tannins. Low but prickly carbonation combined with a syrupy mouthfeel. Just amazing. Drinks like a So bummed I only have one bottle."

4155,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,"Tasted from 2016 bottle. Thick and chewy. Not overly Bourbon on taste but definitely on the nose along with caramel, molasses, vanilla, coffee, cocoa. Incredible BA stout."
4156,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.49,"Appearance - The beer was pinkish red is color with white bubble clinging to the sides of the glass.  Smell -,The nose brought to mind vinegary red berries.  Taste - There was a lot of raspberry in the taste, but I also detected some tart cherries. It was surrounded by a vinegary presence. The profile was tart, but did not remove tooth enamel. Sourness was lessened by a dry finish.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation was fairly intense, allowing for a dry finish.  Overall - This was a fine, well balanced sour."
4157,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.81,"Lucky enough to try on tap at Falling Rocks in Denver. If you've heard the hype, believe it. It's what I imagine fermented peaches would taste like. Little alcohol, lots of peach flavor, a good sour funk that dances with the sweetness of peach. Never heard of this before my vacation in CO, I'd come back just for this!"
4158,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.82,"Vintage 2016 The pour is black. The taste is bittersweet chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, char, mild prune, & tobacco. The mouthfeel is medium. Cheers! A"
4159,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.74,"Appearance - nice white foam head that lingers, cloudy orange color that looks like OJ, Aroma has tons of citrus notes - the nectarine is immediately noticeable, slight funk notes as it warms - Taste is out of this world good - so much citrus juice-like acidity that compliments the lactic acid and makes this beer next level good. Body is full and balanced, sour with the citric & lactic acid but they pair so well together in this beer especially with the sweetness of the nectarine. Overall this beer has so much character and amazingly well made."
4160,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.22,"This beer looks appropriately awesome, pouring blacker than any beer ought to and with a gorgeous, chocolate brown head. As for taste and texture, there's nothing wrong with it; it certainly checks off all the boxes of what a BBA stout ought to be, so I can't call it a disappointment by any measure. That said, when you charge $25 a bottle, I expect a little something extra to set itself apart, and I can't say this fits that bill. If this were, say, $16 a bottle, I'd highly recommend it. As it stands, I'd still recommend it, but it's far from a must-have."
4161,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,3.77,"Muted smell .. flavor lacking too; mostly pine bitterness (though not unpleasant ) with a touch of bready malt but , and this where I’m disappointed. It’s really lacking any juicy flavors from other hill IPAs I’ve enjoyed . Feel is fine, approprsitely carbed, not sticky sweet"
4162,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.79,Smells dank and melon like. Straw colored haze with big fluffy head that leaves some drapes on the way down. Sticky long finish with sweet melon and citrus to go with slight bitterness.
4163,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.37,I tried this beer at the brewery. It poured a hazy yellow with white head and that left some lace. The scent had tropical fruit peel notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with tropical citrus presence and a nice fruit peel spice highlight. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer.
4164,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.46,"Very tasty! While the northern states enjoy their stouts and porters this of time, we Floridians need a tropical touch. Coconuts was exactly what was needed. Excellent porter to enjoy through the holidays!"
4165,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.24,Used a tulip Duval glass. Approximately one inch of head that faded leaving some nice lacing. Smell is an abundance of citrus. Taste is dry piney tangerine with a nice after taste that lingered. Feel is medium to full bodied.
4166,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.64,"I luuurve this beer, dahlins. It pours a nice eggplant color with lots of head. Smells like plum, raisin, spice. The flavor is also plum, raisin, funk, alcohol, spice. It is a superb melange of flavors and as smooth as a fine wine. I might prefer Rochefort by a hair but this is excellent and never disappoints, cheers!"
4167,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.53,"Had this outside and it had a striking bright red color with a wispy pink head. Aroma was fresh cherries mixed with barnyard funk. The taste featured slightly tart cherries with red grapes, hay, leather, some bleu cheese, and funk. A nice long red-wine finish. Light-to-medium bodied and extremely easy to drink."
4168,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.26,This is the 2018 edition. Had on tap at the source.

4170,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.01,"Poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter. Look- Frothy white head, very hazy, deep straw, average head retention, above average lacing. Smell- Tangerine, melon, herbal. Taste- Tangerine, grapefruit, melon, pithy finish. Feel- Medium body, average carbonation, moderate bitterness, slightly astringent finish, creamy. Overall- Good beer, but flavor and bouquet were somewhat muted."
4171,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.29,It’s a big Julius. Kind of sweet. 
4172,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.5,Took a long time but I finally scored this! Good friend mailed it to me. Cracked tonight and split with my wife. A little disappointed but it was good no doubt.
4173,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.5,"Pours dark black. Aroma is complex mix of chocolate, maple syrup, coffee and roasted malt. Taste is equally complex and tasty - follows the aroma with added vanilla and caramel. Full mouthfeel. Incredible stout."
4174,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.56,Batch #2
4175,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,3.45,"Pours pitch black in color with a bigger, bubbly dark brown head. Inherits aromas of nacho cheese, almonds, a load of cinnamon and a good amount of oaken, alcohol soaked oak. Carries its spices in a headstrong fashion, leaning on bakers chocolate and green peppers in a very convincing way, enhanced by a gentle toffee sweetness. Drinks initially smooth, with a late carbonation spark, featuring a surprisingly thin body, which feels inappropriate, compared to the beer‘s full swing chili-barrel hotness. Tastes of bakers chocolate, licorice, scented wood and scorched malts from the very beginning. Its boozy barrel character unfolds among equally hot chilies in a burning and challenging fashion, unsuccesfully calmed by a prominent bitter chocolate flavor. Brings alcohol soaked, dried raisins to the palate during its finish, washing away the beer‘s balancing creaminess with a pungent, complex hotness, which gets a dry touch during its finish. Tastes very booze forward, with an uncompromising interplay between chilies and bourbon. By developing such a hot bite, the beer misses out on its smoothness, which the regular version is able to provide."
4176,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.67,"Canned 19 days ago.  L — Pours a wonderfully enticing pale orange haze with two fingers of dense white head produced with moderately gentle pour. Fabulous retention and lacing, this looks a lot like Green. Everything HF makes is just so… elegant… "
4177,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.62,"375ml bottle, undated, 2017 release, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 10.21.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a jet black color, inky, oily, sludgy and viscous with a thin head, khaki colored with no retention nor lace. The aroma is fantastic, tons of chocolate, bittersweet but rich with a strong barrel character, lots of bourbon, charred oak and toffee with some molasses and caramel and strong roasted grains with a warm alcohol heat. The flavors are excellent, rich chocolate, super smooth and decadent with a very intense barrel expression, loads of bourbon, spicy and bringing out some caramel and vanilla with a strong charred oak flavor, roasted grain, light molasses and toffee with some stone fruits and licorice. The mouthfeel is perfect, sludge, heavy body that is coating and smooth with a chewy and thick full finish. Verdict: An exceptional barrel aged stout from Jackie O's and Side Project. It's got everything a barrel aged stout needs to have, a thick body, a complex and delicate flavor profile weaving chocolate, bourbon, oak, and stone fruits into a beautiful product that doesn't need to rely on any adjuncts. Just a stunner of a beer."
4178,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.66,"16.9oz bottle into a tulip. Thanks Ryan for sharing. Muddy brown body, small head. On the nose is Candied sugar, molasses, dark fruit. On the tongue this is super complex and flavorful. Liquid candy - dark sugar, sweet caramel bark, syrupy molasses, toffee, a touch of aged hops, light bitter aftertaste. Rich body and mouthfeel.  One of the best if not the best barleywine I've ever had. So complex and flavorful."
4179,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.49,Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a strong citrus. Taste is also a fairly strong citrus that is very pleasant.
4180,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.67,"At 54° pours a cloudy deep gold/peach juice color; two fingers of rocky white foam; looong cap retention; streaming carbonation; heavy ring with heavy minus bands of lace. Nose is pineapple, grapefruit and peach. Taste follows nose; semi sweet malt base; grapefruit rind bitterness; lemon, tangerine as beer warms. Medium full body; moderate minus carbonation that is kinda prickly; no astringency; light creamy tongue coating. Overall, very well balanced; tropical fruit flavors and citrus hop bitterness play well with the firm malt foundation; yummy light bitter fruit juice aftertaste; I could easily drink another one - delicious!"
4181,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,5.0,"Easily my favorite non-BA coconut stout. It's basically coconut candy in a well done base stout. The coconut aroma stops you in your tracks. Mouth feel is on the thicker side for a non-BA, gets better as it warms. Easy 5/5."
4182,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.93,"The best Belgian Beer ever. It passes all the tests: looks, fragrance, mouthfeel, taste, after-taste. I mean this is the epitome of craft beer, or beer science. This is the holy grail. And I have tasted Pliny the Younger, Stone Enjoy By, Trappist Rocheforte, Westleverten. Please do yourself a favor and drink this chilled. Your perception of Beer will change. Pure Beer bliss."
4183,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.68,L: pours a gorgeous vibrant orange.
4184,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.48,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a pleasant bourbon and coffee blend. Taste is also a pleasant mild blend of bourbon and coffee.
4185,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.71,"blend 2 poured from a 375mL bottle into perennial wine glass. pours a cloudy light orange. white head that disappears quickly and leaves nice lacing. smell is fruit forward along with some oak and a bit of that side project sour / funk smell. taste is exquisite. not at all over-the-top sour like la fosse or fuzzy. full mouthfeel, a little dry. overall, a wonderful entry in the side project fruited 375 series that’s alluded me due to its infrequent release."
4186,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.47,"Parking lot share with George...pours a cloudy golden orange color. Nice and hazy! Aroma of pine, subtle citrus are abundant. Taste is citrus up front with mid sip malt and finishes piney. Feel is relatively viscous for a DIPA. I love this! Overall, an excellent west coast DIPA. Very smooth for 9%!"
4187,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.75,"2018 vintage - drank on 7/13/2019. Definitely bourbon to the taste; plenty of anise, very complex. Thanks to jhavs! 2019 vintage - drank on 7/13/2019. Counterintuitively, this is smoother and has more pronounced chocolate. I prefer it to 2019. Awesome. Thank you to jhavs again!"
4188,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.03,"750ml bottle at share. pale golden with small ring of head. Stone fruit, peaches in the aroma, light savory notes. Lots more dessert elements in the taste, cinnamon, peaches, pie crust."
4189,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.12,"Sweet, tropical hoppy, and earthy/grassy nose on this one! Taste follows with a grassy and earthy, melon hoppy, subdued bitter finish. Feels great for a single...grassy notes are dominant here. Good, but a little unbalanced with the earthy bitterness."
4190,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.84,"I’ve wanted this one for a while and finally get the chance to sip on it on a snowy MI Sunday afternoon, before the NFL conference championships get rolling. Beautiful mocha head sits atop viscous jet black, and smells of cinnamon, chocolate and slight smoky pepper. I absolutely love Mexican mocha/mole beers like this and holy cow does this one not disappoint!! Cinnamon and chocolate lead the way and the cinnamon doesn’t overwhelm in the least. Perfect. Tastes somewhat like a chocolate-covered graham cracker. The pepper is slight, and I don’t pick up much heat, but I’m weird in that I like a nice lingering burn in the throat.  This absolutely was worth the wait. Just wish I had easier access to more..."
4191,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.19,2020 brew poured Jan 2021 into own brewery goblet. Jet black with insignificant head and no effervesence.
4192,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.86,"2021 vintage: Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Look- Black, medium brown frothy head, average head retention and lacing. Smell- Cocoa, bourbon, oak, coffee. Taste- Bourbon, coffee, slight cherry, slightly sweet in the middle and finish. Feel- Full body, smooth, average carbonation, mouth warming, mouth coating. Overall- Delightful experience."
4193,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.24,"In review is a 2012 vintage from the cellar. A - Very dark brown pour that's borderline black, thick and creamy caramel colored lacing. Thick and viscous on the sides of the glass with lots of legs. S - Nose is dominated by chocolate and cocoa with a slight hint of dark fruit. T - Chocolate and cocoa all throughout with some slight dark fruit on the very back end. Big chocolate roast presence and a lingering bittersweet chocolate roast finish. M - Full bodied, lip smacking sticky, and velvety texture. semi-dry on the back of the tongue. O - This bottle held up incredibly well for being six years old."
4194,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.5,"Tap @ Moor, Bristol, Zwanze Day 2018 - Pours hazy orange with a small white foamy head. Aroma - Sour, unripe fruits - apricot, peach notes, woody feel. Taste - Tart, fruits - apricot, grassy notes, dry sour finish. Drinks really well with a nice sour fruit balance."
4195,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,5.0,"Reviews are subjective, and based on opinion. But in this case there's no reason to get ticky tacky – this beer is a 5/5. It's not a 4.5/5, or a 4.7/5, or a 4.9/5, it's a 5/5.  I'm no beer expert, but I do know happiness when I feel it.  Of all of the things I love about KBS, happiness is the thing I notice the most. KBS excels in nearly every conceivable metric from a stout lovers' perspective, and while I don't advocate for using alcohol to influence your emotions on a regular basis, Founders KBS truly has made me happy every. single. time. I have consumed it. Every bottle – at least once, causes me to stop and appreciate how good it really is.  If you live in the midwest United States, and have this available to you on a regular basis, take a moment to appreciate that some of the best stouts of all time are available to you at a moments notice, and go purchase some immediately."
4196,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,3.62,"Fresh batch (couldn't read date, but was just distro'ed)  Pours a pale straw with haze"
4197,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.42,"Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip L: Inky black pour with thick creamy brown head. Great retention and lacing.  S: Rich and sweet. Roasted grains. Chocolate and espresso. T.F: Sweet up front. Gentle... milk chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla, roast, and toasted sugars. Mild acidity somewhat balances the lactose but this one is definitely sweet. Medium bodied... super creamy mouthfeel and sticky on the tongue. Complex roast, cocoa, and coffee com through again at the finish. O: An elite milk stout. One of the best.... and a delicious winter's dessert."
4198,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,5.0,"I have to say I was blown away by the flavors in this. Deep dark fudge bourbon goodness. It’s a showcase of what the barrel alone can bring to the party. And what a party it is. Thick. Velvet smooth, vanilla, chocolate swirl. Wonderful."
4199,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.04,"Had on tap at the Whetstone Station, Brattleboro L — Quite deep black for a porter. Tiny tan head that quickly dissipates to nothing. Just a bit of spotty glass lacing	"
4200,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.84,"Canned 3/20, could only imagine how if was fresher. Poured into a snifter. Color is a very cloudy gold with healthy foam and some seriously big time lacing. Smell is citrusy hops with a mildly bitter undertone. Taste is bold juicy, tangy, citrusy hops with no bitterness. It's a super smooth clean drinking beer with minimal alcohol presence for a 10% abv. Just an amazing beer."
4201,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.55,Pours hazy orange yellow out of the bottle. This is the BIO (organic version). A friend brought back from Belgium. 
4202,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.47,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is big, bold coconut right at the forefront. Vanilla bean quickly follows coconut. What happens next is a mixture of gift shop fudge, toffee and coffee and hearty stout malts, with notes of toffee, molasses, caramel, coffee and roasty, toasty, caramely malts charging through. There is a very light whiskey heat on the edge, but it melds into the background well. Flavor profile continues to push the coconut heavy narrative, with vanilla bean coming on second. Between the two, the onset is very sugary. The remainder of the flavor profile works its way back towards balanced by order of notes of toffee, caramel, molasses, coffee, and roasty, toasty malts. Whiskey starts to come on at the end to boil away some of the sugar. Whiskey melds in well, never coming off as hot or out of place. Mouth feel is thick with a grainy velvety texture that feels decadent each and every sip. Overall, boisterous with a lot going on, with coconut and vanilla bean at the helm.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 22oz bottle."
4203,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.52,"2017 bottle L - teku pour. Thin out if the bottle. Dark cola brown in the teku. Nice bubbly offwhite one finger head. Thick sticky lacyling. S - literally made me cackle with mind blowing sensory overload. Like the decadent black tuesday with sweet nutty Nutella and vanilla whipped throughout. Fuck. T - it tastes like black tuesday + hazlenuts... I'd say they did it right. All the dark fruit and deep carmelized sugars of its base brother + dessert like nuttiness.  F - highly carbonated, quite fizzyy. Sweet up front, finishes more dry. Although roughly the same abv as BT this variant tastes significantly hotter. O - stellar shit. I still think BT is my favorite of the weekdays (still have CR to try) but this is right there neck to neck with it."
4204,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.29,"A - Pours a lightly hazed gold with a one finger creamy white head. Nice amount of soapy lacing. S - Aroma is orange, grapefruit and caramel malts. T - The taste is orange, mango, guava, grapefruit, honey, caramel malts and piney malts. M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a crisp dry finish. O - Really solid traditional DIPA."
4205,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.49,Shared 2017 canister. 
4206,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.56,"Fabulous Barleywine. The bourbon is really pronounced and at the same time incredibly smooth. Big bourbon on the nose, with hints of molasses caramel and nuts on the palate. Mouthfeel is rich. Must have if you're a Barleywine person."
4207,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.65,"Drank from a 500 ml (1 pt .9 fl. oz) bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA"
4208,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.75,"Tasted from bottle. Pours a dark ruby brown. Caramel and molasses on aroma. Sticky thick mouthfeel. Flavors of caramel, brown sugar, dates, raisins, butterscotch. Incredible English barleywine."
4209,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,5.0,"From a growler filled at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, poured immediately into a tulip glass. Look-"
4210,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.46,"Pours out dark brown. Some light penetration. Not completely opaque. Half a finger of head that fades quickly. Smell is huge and delicate at the same time. Bourbon, brown sugar, banana, bready malt, cinnamon, raisin, toffee, a tiny whiff of the soy sauce character that appears when you mix strong malt and barrel aging. Some savory nuttiness on the fade out. These all mix so well, without a strong presence of booze.  Taste is everything that the nose is. Drinking this I could guess why they called it Stickee Monkee. It's like a Sticky Pecan Bun and Monkey Bread all at the same time. The cinnamon, brown sugar, and nuttiness matched with the sweet glazed flavor of banana and raisin packed baked bread. All balanced on a razor's edge.  Fine bubbles create a very smooth mouthfeel. But the consistency is a little on the thin side.  I can see why a lot of people rave over this beer. Compared to Sucaba and Parabola this beer holds a smooth delicate quality over those two. Parabola is aggressive and strong, not to be taken lightly. Sucaba has robust and complex flavors that could be dissected for hours. Stickee Monkee says forget all of that. It doesn't assault your senses, but rather lures you in. And if you follow where it takes you, you will be rewarded."

4212,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.61,"2019 vintage. Appearance is standard imperial stout. Dark brown/black body, tan head that doesn't dissipate right away. Thick. Sticks to the glass. Smells like maple and chocolate. There's coffee in there somewhere, but the maple overpowers the nose. Taste follows nose, but with coffee. Sweet maple mostly, coffee as well but not as prominent. Body/feel is fantastic, sticks around well after swallowing. Overall, I'd never turn this beer down. It isn't something to drink everyday, but it's a delicious treat for every now and again!"
4213,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.47,"From a bottle to a glass L: looks an amazing dark brown with a 1 inch caramel colored head which turns into great lacing almost immediately S: strong coffee aromas with sweet caramel undertones. This beer doesn't make you search for the smells T: as advertised, this beer is bitter from the coffee and sweet from the caramel. If you have ever tasted a riesen candy, it tastes identical to that. Somewhat bitter, but the sweetness lingers on your pallet. F: it has the feel.of an 8.3% beer and I could only have 1 or 2 O: a super tasty beer, but be careful...it'll sneak up on you. Overall, a great stout"
4214,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.5,"Poured a deep red fruit punch color with no head. Aroma is very sweet and juicy with heavy notes of tart cherries. Even picking up the sweet maraschino cherries from the jar. Not much barrel character though. Then at first sip, it starts dry but as it warms up, it immediately showcase the sweet, juicy tart cherries. Very fruity, like sweetened cherry juice added. The sour is is not too harsh, allowing the sweet malt to carry through, making the beer almost drink like candy. There is heavy carbonation that oddly seems to reduce at room temp. Overall, a very approachable sour that doesn’t fall short on the added cherries!"
4215,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.75,"Special release beer from HH that stands out among their impeccable lineup of strong Double and Triple NEIPAs. Insanely well masked alcohol at double digit ABV and intense complex bouquet of tropical tasting notes. Worth the hype, but need to drink fresh."
4216,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.96,"L- Almost identical to Founder's other brews, KBS and KBS Espresso only with visible bubbles in the stout"
4217,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.39,"As a New Englander who has been to Vermont several times...I can't help but make the comparison (which I feel is apt) to Hill Farmstead's lovely array of farmhouse ales. Simultaneously simple yet complex - Bernice comes through across all four sensory components with high marks. She pours slightly cloudy, yellow liquid that sits beneath a cap of white foam. Light, but lively, effervescence brings the beer to life. Aroma is citrus, hay and light funk. Balanced harmony with each playing to the others' strengths. Restrained but remarkable. Taste is citrus - apricot, lemon and grapes - followed by a tart and funky kiss. Fruity and earthy yeast-notes throughout.  Tart, refreshing, appropriately acidic and lightly funky. Delicious."
4218,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.41,Canned on 7/02/21 and enjoyed in a 16oz Founders snifter on 8/27/21.
4219,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.24,"10oz draft pour at the Three Floyds Taproom, poured into a snifter glass, enjoyed on 6.6.19, reviewed from tasting notes. The beer pours a orange and amber color, golden hues when hit by the light and a firm finger of white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a few spots of soapy lacing. The aroma is very good, super resinous, lots of citrus peel, lightly floral, more on the dank side of things with a strong sticky sweet malt backbone, assertive and boozy. The flavors are great, bitter and resinous pine, dank floral and grassy qualities, lots of citrus peel that offers some tropical fruits but ultimately more bitterness and a heart malt backbone, strong caramel and amber malts with some softer cereal grains and a warm booze character. The mouthfeel is good, sticky, coating, medium bodied with a good liveliness to it and finishes with a big dry kick and a warm boozy bite. Verdict: A very good west coast IPA from Boneyard. Classic in style, bold, brash, just a massive IPA, certainly boozy but with an oddly nice balance. West Coast through and through, just a massive IPA."

4221,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.39,"i am surprised to learn this is the same base beer as fuzzy, which to me wasnt anywhere near this sour, this beer seems way more acidic to me, but maybe thats the impact of the different fruits on it or of its relative maturity, i really dont know. either way, this is up there with the very best beers i have had from side project to date. pale hazy lambic looking beer, with a fizzy white head that dissipates fast. the aroma is the best part for me, woody bretty funk with citrusy bacterial tang over a pale wheaty base, it is lambic at its core it seems, but the fruit is so vibrant here, soft super ripe apricots, their absolute essence, intense and amazingly enticing. sometimes apricots and peaches can be a little samey in beers, depending on how they are used, but there is no mistaking these apricots! so true to the real fruit, in its best form. the flavor is like that too, with a lot of the sourness and wild yeast flavor (and wood) on the front end, and all the fruit showing up later on. i like the progression of flavors moving this way, the fruit lingers long in the finish, but the beer is very dry. its a step more sour than it needs to be i think, it sort of hurts the teeth like that, has an overdeveloped bacterial sting, and sits litle vinegary in the belly. still nice bretty notes about, as fruity as the apricots themselves. great carbonation and a very light body. a very special beer, and perhaps as good an apricot wild beer as has been made in the states... edit: just had a blend three from awhile ago now, and it was exceedingly sour, way past the point where i would want to drink even this little bottle by myself, its got a nail polish remover thing going on, and really is overly intense in that regard. i like the apricot still, and i like the flavor overall, lemony and natural, the fruit has held up well. unfortunately, this is another beer from these guys that is just way too sour at this point, they have all been trending in that direction, but its too much now. i liked it much better when it was fresh."
4222,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.47,2019 vintage L -- Black with a small khaki-hued head produced with moderate pour. Minimal retention and some lacing
4223,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.74,"I'm a huge fan of Trillium's higher gravity DIPAs and wasn't sure what to expect with a Pale Ale DDH, but I am very impressed. Great nose and look, very juicy in flavor and scent. The mouth feel is very light compared to their larger ABV offerings, but it bursts with flavor through to the end of the glass. A great beer at an attractive price point!"
4224,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.57,"Poured into teku glass via bottle Color is deep brown with mocha foam Smell is copious amounts of cinnamon, coffee and maple syrup Taste is a huge blast of cinnamon up front followed by the bitter roasty coffee and ending with the sweetness of the maple syrup"
4225,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.49,"2018 version. Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Thanks bro for shipping to me from Tampa.  Dark brown with a nice creamy tan head. Some sticky lacing clings to the glass. Strong smell of toffee, maple, burnt caramel. Lighter smell of coffee, vanilla and smoke. My mouth is watering. Taste mimics the nose. Prominent maple/ toffee followed by coffee and smoke. Sweet but not overly so. Very complex and easy drinking.  Mouthfeel is medium with awesome carbonation. It's not thick but at 6.4%, it drinks bigger than it is.  Well made and delicious. I had no problem navigating through the whole bottle while watching an hour long tv show. Smell is amazing and the taste is not far behind. Get this one if you can. Highly recommended."
4226,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.5,"A 750ml bottle at Nüetnigenough. 2013 sticker, bottled on 27th April 2015. Poured into a Cantillon tasting glass. Appearance: It poured a clear golden colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly and left some sparse lacing. Aroma: Apple, floral, lemon, hay, grass, barnyard with a touch of light funk. Taste: Quite similar to the aromas with apple, lemon, grass, hay, floral, sour, light vinegar and funk. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with high to moderate carbonation. Overall: A great gueuze. Loving the Lou Pepe varieties from Cantillon. A refreshing spritzy gueuze that is very easy to drink."
4227,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.28,"L: Poured from a bottle to a snifter glass. Had a bright, cherry red (duh) color and a hazy consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy / fizzy, off white head that quickly dissipated. Not much lacing.  S: A very nice aroma of cherries, yeast, citrus fruit, an earthy quality, and some other berries. T: Tasted of a hint of citrus fruit (lemon, orange, fleetingly), light raspberry notes (always nice), a ton of cherries (the dominant force, of course), a little yeast and a light earthiness. This is a tart, sweet, and surprisingly subtle flavor. It's not nearly as tart / sour as some wild ales, but it definitely has some force behind it. Tasty. F: An average amount of carbonation with a lively finish. Medium-bodied. O: An incredibly enjoyable beer. Drinkable."
4228,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.83,"L: Bright honey, apricot hues that are warmly greeted by a thin white head"
4229,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.44,"Unbelievably huge thanks to Anthony for this massive want of mine. Very excited.  500ml bottle - b6 (Feb. '19) poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F.  Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen.  Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake.  Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish.  Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry.  Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class."
4230,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.69,"I don't see how a wild can get any better than this! Pour is nectarine orange and opaque, with a fizzy short lasting head, but a bountiful ring of nectarine pulp decorating the rim of the glass all the way around that's there to stay. Nose is definately nectarine with some peach and star fruit, and taste is all nectarine. Mouthfeel is softly carbonately and tart on the finish. This thing is so good. Nice job de Garde!"
4231,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.61,"Pours a fairly hazy yellow-light orange. Wonderful passionfruit and orange hop flavors on the nose. The palate follows through with plenty of citrus and tropical hop flavors. A very refined, well-crafted beer where everything just works."
4232,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.18,"Poured a copper-tinted reddish body with fizzy carbonation but no head or lace. The aroma is sour/tart and chock full of cranberries and cherries along with some razzies and oak. Excellent balance between tart cherries, sour/sharp cranberries, some raspberry sweetness and an oaky smoothness with no booze and a filling body."
4233,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.6,"Pours an entitely hazed orange yellow with a huge, spongy and stable head. Bursts of passion fruit, ripe pineapples and fresh cut limes, establishing an exotic fruitiness from first glance. Has a white bread dough undertone adding to the hop inspired nose, revealing additional mango, tangerine and white wine grapes.  Has a soft, smooth mouthfeel to it with a fitting, complimenting carbonation. This has a lighter to medium body with a nice, refreshing effervescence during its finish. Tastes of ripe mango, luscious peaches and bitter limes, accompanied by an ice bonbon freshness and a noble hop dryness. The beer then develops an intriguing old cheese, ripe oranges interplay with a resinous peak to it, gently balanced by flowery limes and breadcrust malts. Finishes dry and bitter with a vivid fruit basket, lighter and a bit more crisp, creating a great complexity on its way out.  This is quite unusual for a hazy ipa, making excessivly use of the great Nelson hop, which works marvelously well together with Citra. It‘s creating an unforseen depth which not solely relies on fruit forward flavors, but introducing a cheesy, resinous complexity, even showing off a lighter note of sweet malts. Everything in this comes together in perfect harmony, making you wish for this to last on your tongue in perpetuity."
4234,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,3.91,"Bottle at share. Cloudy white wine looking pour, a few bubbles. Aroma and taste are straight up white grapes. Sharp tartness, sweet. reminds me of Welch's white grape juice, but with a pucker."
4235,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.45,"2018 bottle poured into a snifter. Opaque dark brown color with a modest but persistent tan head. Rich bourbon, maple, and chocolate on the nose. Smelled decadent, and the taste was more so. Thick but not overly sweet. A rich serving of barrel, vanilla, chocolate, and enough maple to punctuate it, but not dominate. Warm but not overly boozy on the finish. Worthy of its reputation."
4236,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.47,"Sweet, thick, black stout. Smell is filled with bourbon, molasses, chocolate, coffee and some alcohol. That's sweet with toasted oak, dark chocolate, molasses, vanilla, coffee and bourbon. Very great beer."
4237,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,3.79,"2017 Green Wax  L: Look is of regular dark lord, dark, with a slight khaki minimal head that quickly dissipated.  S: Again, same as regular dl. Where is the barrel? Dark fruit, sugary and sweet.  T: It was like drinking regular dark lord. There was a very faint barrel presence, but it tasted like normal dl. Overly sweet, sugary and dark fruit.  F: Medimum body, wich was about the best attribute the beer had going for itself.  O: The 17 vintage does not live up to past representations of the beer. Lacks barrel and would seek out others before this one. Wish I would have traded this one away."
4238,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,5.0,"Maman 2018 Pours a truly oily, coal black color with a fluffy, beige head, receeding to a smaller ring of lacing. Smells of profound bitter chocolate, bakers chocolate, campfire and a gentle, yet profound bourbon aroma. Relatively straight forward on the nose, yet equally intriguing as for its complex bourbon and chocolate interplay. Drinks surprisingly easy, thick with a fuller body, its booze being perfectly soaked up by the luscious chocolate flavor profile. This features almost a flat level of carbonation, while the beer‘s mouthfeel is that that thick, that it benefits tremendously from the lack of potentially mineralic effervescence, highlighting its multi layered chocolate decadence. Tastes of rich milk chocolate, soothed by layers of whipped cream and oaky, slighty warming bourbon barrel. Warms up even more with a rustic barrel presence, soothed by the incredibly smooth and silk mouthfeel, accompanied by bitter chocolate and slightly spicy licorice. Finishes a little sweeter, reminiscend of a rock sugar cocoa blend, tied together by tobacco and even more whipped cream, more licorice and a little bit of charred malts, topped off by a long lasting, spicy bourbon aftertaste. This is astonishtingly complex while the beers drinks incredibly easy at the same time. Also this offers the most incredible mouthfeel, smooth and soft, caressing the tongue in the most pleasant way, while handling the 13 abv playfully. On the one hand this is a pretty straight forward chocolate imperial stout, on the other hand this opens up the palate to a plethora of finely nuanced flavors, resulting in a truly complex tasting beer. What a treat, this is a clear winner due to its emphasized world class mouthfeel, allowing the flavors to shine like in no other beer."
4239,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.56,"Had this on 2021-03-18 near Pittsburgh, PA from a 16oz canned on 2021-03-09 A - Murky straw-gold with a 2-finger pillowy-white head that sticks around leaving excellent lace. S - Like being in an orange grove with wet earth right before it's time to harvest. Really nice. T - A bounty of layered flavors. Orange, cracker, herbal, earthy, pine , honey and slightly dank. As the honey sweetness dissipates, the pine and orange baby aspirin bitterness comes in. M - Medium body and carbonation. LIghtly resinous and then very dry. O - World class. I've had plenty of NEIPAs and it isn't a style that I seek out, but this one tastes as much like a dry West Coast IPA as a NEIPA; somewhat similar to Heady Topper."
4240,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.35,"Picked up cans fresh from the taproom, packaged 2/19/20 (just over a week old). Looks opaque, milky yellow with a frothy white head. "
4241,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.6,"After 8 years of hunting this beer, I finally got to experience it via bottle! Thank you RR for bottling this for us east coasters! Pours a clear effervescent body, a nice frothy head that leaves excellent retention and lacing. Nice looking beer.  Aromas are west-coast forward, pine and resinous, dank hops, minimal alcohol. On the tongue is easy, flavorful, crisp, piney, grapefruit, citrus, all the good west coast characteristics while being incredibly balanced. Crisp mouthfeel, medium body.  Worth the hype! A true west coast classic. I'd drink a lot of this if I had access to it."
4242,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.4,"Pours black with a finger of caramel-colored foam. Head retention is poor. Aroma is maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, oak, and roasty and toasty malts. Very deep aroma with a springy sweetness. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty and caramely malts and medium-roast coffee, chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, toffee and caramel. A touch of bourbon and its heat and woody oak balances out the sweetness a little. It's sweet, but not overly sweet. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a very smooth and lightly creamy texture. It's thickness and consistency is medium-thick. Overall, maple syrup and coffee is huge and pairs well with bourbon. Heat is minimal, especially when considering the 11% ABV.  Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 22oz bottle."
4243,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.85,"2008 vintage served at Ma Che Siete Venuti a Fà in Rome. This is almost a religious experience being able to finally try Kaggen. Pours an intense dark hue with a two inch brown head and good lacing. Immediately get a big whiff of chocolate, vanilla and oak. Very aromatically pleasing. The taste follows the nose with roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. Just a wonderfully smooth integration of all the elements as you sip on this and it feels as great in the mouth as going down. The worst part about this beer is that it comes to an end after 25cl. An absolute classic brew that I am grateful to have tried."
4244,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.65,"Scored a bomber at Total wine in Royal Palm , FLA Black liquid crowned by a two finger creamy brown foam cap, quickly recedes , brown ring, few lacings Aroma is maple, bourbon, sweet, roasted malts, tobacco, slight smokiness Nice maple bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts taste Smooth, alcohol is well hidden , slight char bitterness lingers , medium sudsing  Great beer, repeatable"
4245,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.59,"12oz can labeled 2019 poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 10.3% ABV. The beer pours dense oily black with strong mocha head on hard pour. The head recedes to a half inch cap and leaves some lacing. The aroma is immediately noticeable after the pour with elements of chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon. The taste is semisweet caramel and roasted malt with coffee, vanilla, chocolate, oak and bourbon all popping through mid palate before a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full to medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. No sign of the ABV in the taste or aroma. Very balanced and not cloying, yet luxuriously rich. Overall, outstanding. Thank you @russpowell!"

4247,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.53,"had about 8oz in a park, this review might not be accurate."
4248,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.75,Poured from a cracked bottle (damaged during shipping) into a styrofoam cup in the parking ramp over my work lunch hour. After I opened the stained shipping box to find that the bottle still had about 6 ounces in it I decided I just had to try this. Glad I did. Amazing beer loaded with chocolate. Creamy and smooth. If not for the acquisition cost I'd go after another of these.
4249,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.25,"Batch 3 (2018), poured into an Alesmith snifter. Pours a medium dark espresso. Nose is mostly maple, coffee, and oak, with some butterscotch and caramel. Palate is chocolate fudge, maple, coffee, with oak and butterscotch notes. Disappointingly, the chocolate and maple dominates the barrel character, so it’s not as complex as one might hope. Still a good brew, but it's not in the upper tier of the category."
4250,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.5,Nice take on a favorite. Can’t go wrong with King Sue. Hazy and hoppy.  Maybe a little more grapefruit than the original. Easy to drink.
4251,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.35,"375ml undated bottle from the most recent release. Pours hazy copper with a half inch head of white with a vigorous pour. Minimal retention or lacing. Surprisingly low carbonation for the style. Light notes of cider vinegar, grape must, wine barrel, and wet hay in the nose. Light bodied with a slickish, thinnish mouthfeel. Vineous and tart on the palate with undertones of Burgundy, citrus, and apples. Finishes fairly dry with some lingering tannins, red fruit, and grapeskins. Nice beer but proper carbonation for the style would really help the aromatics and mouthfeel. Not really getting a ""juicy"" impression either."
4252,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.8,"Great look. Head goes away somewhat quickly but otherwise a nice dark look. Smell is unbelievable - vanilla bourbon is clear and strong with the stout smell to round it out. Taste is also excellently complex, with smoky vanilla bourbon and a more traditional stout at the front. Feels fantastic with low carbonation and a long cholacte-adjacent aftertaste. Superior Brewmanship."
4253,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,3.51,"16oz can poured into a snifter. A: Dark brown, nearly black. Huge brown head is comprised of large bubbles and sticks around for a while. It’s rather cola-like in appearance, but for the head’s staying power. S: Cola, fudge sauce, dark maple syrup, faint coffee acidity, woody and nutty, mild roast. Pretty straightforward and surprisingly subdued.  T: Plenty of dark maple syrup up front. Sweet cola, blackstrap molasses, mild roast. Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Nutty coffee struggles to pull through, but eventually succeeds for only a fleeting second. Tight stewed prune dark fruit notes. Decidedly sweet throughout. There’s some slight acidity and roast, but not enough to fully balance. Maple syrup all over the long and sweet finish. M: There’s a bit of a creamy and fluffy texture here, but ultimately the residual sweetness dominates with a syrupy and coating feel. It’s downright sticky. Carbonation is ample but soft.  O: Pretty much all of Tree House’s stouts and porters trend well into the sweet side of the spectrum. Some find a way to strike a balance and keep the sweetness in check just enough, and some end up fairly cloying. This one is unfortunately in the latter camp. It’s just too sweet and sticky. Play up the smokey/roasty/coffee flavors more and they might have a more drinkable end product here. As it stands this was a tough 16oz to finish."
4254,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,5.0,Wow! Having at a share right after I had Damon from Hill Farmstead and I think I like this better. Very marshmallows mouthfeel. Pours so dark with a great head. Delicious!
4255,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.33,"L - 3-finger dense, bright white head atop a milky yellow body. S - strong grapefruit, pineapple, orange.  T - lots of pineapple and grapefruit. Clean middle. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Low booziness. F - medium body and carb. O - super tropical and refreshing."

4257,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.72,"Had a 4oz pour at a bottleshare. Look wasn't anything crazy but the smell was so complex showcasing barrel,funk, and loads of peaches in perfect balance. The taste was both jammy and some dryness in the back. The feel was medium and effervescent. Overall a great BA fruited wild ale that i hope i can get my own bottle to share with the wife."
4258,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.46,"From a bottle, pours as an opaque deep brown with a two-finger dense khaki-colored head. Aromas of sweet-malt like molasses, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, toasted/burnt bread. Taste is very malt-forward (so rich coffee roasted barley and cocoa flavors - but also - an oppressive sugar load). Nicely, this brew, clocking in at 12.3% alcohol, manages to NOT taste ""boozy"" (the totally sugar masking that). Mouth-feel is creamy and full. Overall, this (for me) is a one-and-done beer; nice for once a week, but not as a regular go-to."
4259,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.6,Oh hell this is one glorious beer which delivers on all levels. Spot on chewy mouth feel and the vanilla helps round out the finish. Nose hides the alcohol well and vanilla is the predominant note although the taste is full
4260,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.48,"From bottle. Near black. Dark head dissipated to slicks. Smell is elegant. Good, clean malts. Surprised this isn't BA. Has a rich caramel and vanilla element. Sweet and smooth. HF feel never disappoints. Great beer."
4261,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.0,"750ml bottle at share. Pale golden/pink, bubbly head. Aroma is stone fruity, peaches, light vanilla. taste brings a little citrus, but mostly the peaches, and a trace of vanilla."
4262,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,3.81,I prefer the double-dry hopped (as do most). I think this one has gone downhill a bit in recent years which leads to my rating. I love TG but this one is missing something for me to be this high on the list.
4263,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.5,"750ml bottle at share. Ruby colored pour, head is a light pink. Raspberrries. Period. Huge berry aroma and taste, normal lambic funk. Slight barrel eleemnts. Great stuff."
4264,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.04,good peach sour. long finish. ren's bottle. spider lace. not overwhelming sour. very fruity. a delight. great balancing. A bit of orange fruit colour.
4265,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.93,"Zenne batch 2 poured into a Torst glass. Golden orange in color. Not much of a head. Aromas of oak and sherry release from the glass. Picking a little citrus as well. Upon first sip, I’m speechless. So complex yet perfectly balanced. Oak, sherry and subtle nuances of funk and citrus. This is so easy to drink. Perfectly carbed and each sip is a treat. This is the best lambic I’ve ever tasted hands down. Amazing brew!"
4266,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.87,Probably right up there in my all time favorite beers. Friend brought some to me after a trip to Maine. Crisp blend of hops and fruity flavor that is slightly bitter but still very approachable.
4267,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.31,"this thing is a beast, even more packed with all of these awesome flavors than the maple bacon is, but without the unifying and mellowing barrel elements of the morning wood. big thanks to my homie for bringing this one over for maple beer night, i had not ever seen it before, but have loved its two sister beers! its as thick and dense looking as it seems like it should be, near black but a high luster and some nice thick foamy tan head. it smells more like coffee than anything else, seemingly higher in the proportionality than in the maple bacon, a little less smoke and greasiness and all too, and still with a high maple sweetness element. there is a lot of nuance here too though like black pepper and fresh tobacco and molasses. its as complex in the flavor too, but we are all sort of stunned at how this isnt super insanely sweet. i mean its still way more sugary than you could reasonably drink a whole bomber of, but this is not over the top at all, despite the maple flavor still being really potent in here. nice almost burnt dark malt complexion to even it out, and all the coffee really helps. i didnt catch a bottle date, but the coffee tastes pretty fresh in here to me, and its intensity cuts some of the weight of the body and the sweetness, i like its contribution a lot. the bacon part of this is a little underwhelming, less obvious in the mix than in the base beer, light campfire smoke is all, this isnt meaty or anything to me. a really intense brew, but as good as any of the wildly flavored stouts these guys do. i dont think it needs the barrel. i enjoyed this edition a lot and it was a great end to our epic maple beer night!"
4268,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.18,"Popped this bottle at an epic Omaha, Nebraska bottle share. Poured into a teku. I felt this was a little over hyped. Drinkability was nice for a 21%er... Better than Black Tuesday. Mouthfeel was lacking a bit. Not worth going out of your way for imo."
4269,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.55,L: Black as pitch brew. No light passes even at the fringes of my Firestone Teku.
4270,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.74,"750ml bottle. Batch 1. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass on 5/10/2015. Appearance is pitch black. Perfectly contrasts with the Side Project lightbulb logo. Beautiful. Two finger brown head with appropriate retention time; disappears into a very thin collar, no film. No lacing.  Smells of tart cherries up front, fresh out of the fridge. It doesn't smell as sour as I was expecting it to be after one year in the bottle. Moderately acidic but not vinegary or lactic. After a few minutes, thick chocolate fudge comes out; literally like chocolate fondue. The cherries are still strong at this point, making for a nice chocolate covered cherry aroma. Oak, a bit of vanilla. The whiskey starts coming out more as it warms, as well. Smoky, sweet, robust whiskey; a nice complement, never quite emerging to the fore. Overall, to sum up the full extent of the aroma in one sentence- tart cherries covered in dark chocolate with a bit of vanilla essence and oak; mellow whiskey in the background. Fair amount of acidity, but not particularly lactic. Flavour is equally complex. Initially, tart cherries, dark chocolate. So like in the nose, chocolate covered cherries. Not particularly sweet. Small amounts of vanilla are present, as is a moderate vinegary acidity. As it warms up, the oak and tannins seem to combine with the acidity to give a vinous flavour, like a Syrah; in my mind, it seems to impart a lot of red wine notes into the flavour; I suspect this is due to the combination of the oak tannins and the acidity. Whiskey is there, underneath all of this. No heat, but a subtle char is noticeable towards the end. A very complex beer that seems to evolve with minute changes in temperature, finally reaching its peak at room temperature. Even more cherries come out at the end. It's really a fascinating drinking experience. The body is rich and substantial, which you'd think would be strange for an AWA, but it's substantial without being dry or creamy. Smooth with good carbonation. Different flavours follow each other in waves as they roll over your tongue, leaving a pleasantly tart, oaky and mildly sticky aftertaste without any kind of heat. Overall, this is one of the more unique beers I've had the pleasure of drinking over the last 3 years. When I think about American Wild Ales and how they compare to their old world counterparts, I tend to find that most heralded examples of Wild Ales seem to be lacking in complexity by being so boldly acidic. Cory King has somehow taken the genre to another level by creating a beer that is bold in every way with plenty of acidity yet nuanced with a great array of different flavours that make each sip a new experience in of itself. --------------------------------- 750ml bottle of Batch 2. Served in a wine glass. Pours a dark black body with a hint of brown depending on the lighting. One finger tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Not altogether too different from the original batch. Smells of dark chocolate, cherries, oak, vinegar, fudge. The level of acidity you can smell and taste is remarkably similar to one-year old Batch 1 as above, which surprised me. Flavour is very similar; chocolate fudge and chocolate covered cherries, oak, vinegar. The cherries aren't as prominent as expected. The flavours pop nicely, with a nice tart 8/10 acidity that is quite sour but not bracingly so. No off flavours. As the beer warms, it brings out a little more of the chocolate and less of the cherries; it evolves quite a bit just like its predecessor did. Delicious. Mouthfeel is noticeably thinner than the original batch, I felt. There is still a fair amount of body, but perhaps I am comparing everything to Maman which I had the same day. Good carbonation, with a nice residual, slightly fizzy, chocolate fudge and acidity on the backend. Overall, it's not quite Batch 1 as far as body goes, but the flavour remains excellent and one of the more unique beers I've had."
4271,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.58,"Pours a dark reddish brown. If you pour hard you get a runaway fluffy head. A careful slow pour works better. Smells of yeast, bread , dark fruit and alcohol. Tastes of malt, yeast , raisins, plums and booze. This brew has a surprisingly light body and mouthfeel given its strength. This excellent sipper earns its ""World Class"" label fairly!"

4273,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.46,"Pours a beautiful glowing copper, clear and clean. The aroma isn’t as big and vibrant as I might expect, but more subdued and muted. It’s bursting with flavor, all that citra goodness, with just enough heft and body on the back. I thought it was fantastic."

4276,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.25,"Rating 2011 bottle aged 6 years. Very nice old ale. Moderately sweet, nice silky mouthfeel, just a touch if heat. Had a slightly Black licorice taste to it which was slightly off putting to me which kept me from rating it higher. Nice beer overall though; glad to finally try this."

4278,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,3.99,"Parabajava 2016 has, quite sadly, fallen off very badly. Friends and I opened a 2016 side by side with a Parabola 2018... and, surprisingly, the Parabola was the superior of the two. The Parabajava had very little coffee left to brag of, unfortunately - mostly just a lingering acidic taste with a strange umami and vegetal taste. I was tremendously disappointed, after having traded for this bottle. I'm still a very big fan of Firestone Walker beers and do not blame them for a moment. Some beers age well, and others do not. I surely hope that we see a fresh release of this beer some time in the near future for a more favorable review. Fingers crossed."
4279,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.88,"Cannot believe I have not rated this before. While not available here what I have is courtesy of @vabeerguy & @DoctorZombies. This has to be one of my top all time beers, as close to perfect as it gets. I could give it straight 5's but nothing is perfect."
4280,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.99,"Remember that Guitar Hero commercial from way back when with Heidi Klum wearing nothing but a white button up shirt and socks, jamming out like nobody's watching to Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" holding a Guitar Hero controller? Well that was pretty much me after taking one sip of BA Sump. I don't know if it's because I hadn't had beer in a while, or because this particular drinking session happened after three-four weeks worth of very stressful life events, but for some reason I felt a sudden rush of incredible euphoria the exact moment the precious black liquid passed between my lips and my neurotransmitters started firing back signals trying to decode the wonderment beckoning my palatal and olfactory senses -- I guess this is why I'm still obsessed with a hobby that's detrimental to both my health and bank account; which gifts me with nothing but splitting headaches and cottonmouth in the mornings while stealing my gains at the gym. In all sincerity, (regular) Sump is quite possibly the most coffee-forward beer I've ever tried. When I say that it's coffee-forward, I don't mean the kind that your secretary serves you in a white styrofoam cup, lukewarm with creamer and two spoons of sugar. I mean the straight-up bold illustrious flavors that emanate out of fresh roasted beans that may or may not have been burnt beyond the sixth layer of hell because you get your coffee at Starbucks. I'd argue that the coffeeness in Sump's coffee is more coffee than most coffee in a way a rose is a rose is a rose is not a rose, but I'm probably getting ahead of myself at this point so I'll stop. The aroma coming out of the bottle is very much similar to its non-BA kin; so much coffee that you don't quite know whether you want to try and heat it up and drink it black, or put it in a cheap reusable plastic cup with ice, sugar, and saturated fats and serve it with a dollop of whipped cream on top. After some time and temperature, however, the commanding sweetness shares its spot on the podium with a light hint of chocolate, and sweet cream cluing you in that other elements may be at play. I haven't had a beer that was this straightforward since Weyerbacher's Sunday Morning Stout. In fact, for those of you that have tried Sunday Morning and are somewhat familiar with CrossFit: Sunday Morning is to Annie Þórisdóttir what BA Sump is to Katrin Davíðsdóttir. For those of you that don't have a clue what that means, they're both world class beers that I'd drink again without batting an eye, but the latter edges out the former as a more robust all-round mesh of bourbon and coffee flavors.  In plain speak, I have yet to try a beer that comes close to the perfect marriage of coffee and rye whiskey that I've witnessed in BA Sump. Neither flavor eclipses the other, while neither is expressed at less than 100% of its expressable potential -- hell you might as well throw a scalding cup of coffee and a glass of whiskey in my face simultaneously and I'd get all the same sensations, albeit without the masterful blending and delicious flavors."
4281,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.3,"16oz can dated 3/7/19. Pours cloudy yellow with an inch of white fluff. Nice retention and plenty of tattered lacework. Peach, pineapple, and grapefruit in the nose. Medium bodied with a creamy, soft mouthfeel. Pithy citrus with zero malt and a minimal bitterness on the palate. Unripe peach with grapefruit. Finishes very dry and a bit chalky.  Tasty stuff but I wouldn't wait in line for it."
4282,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.44,"Matt, you're a saint. Thank you again for these ones.  Pint can - dated 08/05/20 - poured into a teku at 38°F. Pours an unbelievably turbid banana cream yellow - topped woth two fingers of creamy white head with fair retention, leaving a sheet of lace as it recedes.  Nose: Identifiable Tree House profile, with soft, pale, oaty malt, that signature house yeast note, and all of Green's Galaxy influence. Peach ring candies, candied papaya, ripe apricot, white guava, papaya, a hint of honeydew, a touch of pineapple, which lends a fruity brightness, and just a whisper of that super late-hopped peppery note in the background.  Palate: The beer greets the palate with pale, oat-driven malt which lends just a moderate touch of sweetness. Tons of Galaxy right off the bat, with more peach, nectarine and papaya, and what I'm guessing may be Amarillo, which provides brighter tropical notes of guava, pineapple, and a nice candied orange note. The pineapple aspect builds and provides this nice juicy acidity to counteract the malt and dank Galaxy, and then that super leafy hop cone Galaxy note of Very Green comes in, bringing it back to pithy, resinous hop territory, with a lovely drying, digging, slightly bitter finish with fresh grass, leafy hops, resin, citrus pith, and a slightly herbal note.  Mouthfeel/Body: Like many of the upper echelon of Tree House IPAs, this beer is straight up fluffy, soft, and velvety plush. What makes this even better, is that the soft creamy feel doesn't come at the expense of drinkability. It's soft, but it isn't thick or heavy. It's actually super crisp, and doesn't fight back whatsoever. Effervescence is a touch on the lower side, but there's enough to give the lift it needs. Starts soft, juicy in the middle, and finishes dry and resinous. Great progression. Overall: This is a proper home run from Tree House. Falling somewhere between Green and Very Green. It retains the signature Green genetics, with a lovely fruity spin, and added drinkability. In my honest opinion, this is a superior IPA to Green, falling just short of the magic of Very Green. An absolute must try."
4283,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,Found this beer in Brooklyn and had a 8/25/20 production date.  Pours hazy yellow with just the right head. Smell is subdued but the first sip is chock full of citrus and a bit of bitterness which departs quickly. Each sip gets better and the mouthfeel is quite something. Makes you want to return for another sip to experience it's nuances. Great take on Citra hops and have one more to try this weekend.
4284,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.43,"L: A glass of murky orange juice with a finger of ivory foam settling down to a wisp and a ring, an leaving thin broken lines of lace behind. S: Tropical and citrus fruits, and ringing out above these is a sour grapefruit. The aroma is slightly soapy and the strong wet stone notes fade with the drinking. T: Follows the nose with a prominent orange citrus, earthy tones, malt, stone, and minor hints of soap and bubblegum. F: Smooth medium body, starts quite malty, but this seems to die off rather quickly. O: A bit overrated IMO. This is a rather good beer, but neither as tropically fruity nor as green as I’d hoped for."
4285,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.42,"Bottle @ La Palma Sour Fest 2015. Hazy orange colored beer with a small white head. Holy smokes is this funky.

Pretty citrusy and zesty as well. A winner, as usual."

Where is the coconut? Well, I'll be honest, the one whale stout with coconut, BCBS Prop. '13, I did not get to try. Coffee on the back end. Alcohol is cloyed, but whoa, this could be served between two! Border pastry stout? mmm...I would have desired a light carbonation."
4290,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.25,"Poured very dark, impervious to light. Big maple aroma. Flavor is sweet, loads of maple, some chocolate, light coffee flavor on the finish. Creamy and fairly full bodied. Overall a good desert imperial stout.  1/22/20"

4299,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.09,"Hazy orange with four fingers of long-lasting yellowed, antique white head. Heavy webbed lacing. Green onion, pine, weed and orange citrus in the nose.  These elements continue to the taste where they’re joined by strong bitterness, as well as a solid malt backbone and some light nuttiness. There’s a hint of tropical fruit behind everything in both the aroma and taste, too, but it’s just about buried.  Full bodied, while maintained a soft, pillowy feel. The pine resin just sticks to the back of your mouth in this one. I’m not a fan of the nutty element, but love everything else about this beer."

Medium to full bodied for the style, well carbonated, creamy mouth feel, mildly bitter finish."
4302,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.08,"Bourbon Barrel Black Maple pours a very deep brown and sports a light brown head of foam. The head dissipates fairly quickly. The beer smells quite good - it's certainly sweet, per the nose, but also has a bit of booziness.  While cold, the beer has a slightly dry mouth feel. The barrel is definitely present. It is, per the smell, very sweet. The maple somehow fails to be all that present in the taste. As the beer warms, it just gets sweeter. It has a nice bit of heat to it, but the alcohol isn't present in the taste. As with CBS - I'd expected more of this beer. I like maple, in general and as an adjunct, so the last few maple beers have let me down a bit. Great Notion's Double Stack has been the only one to really impress me thus far. Wish it was easier to get!"
4303,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.47,"Jet black body topped with an immensely dense and creamy light tan head. Rich dark malt aroma; loads of mild chocolate and cocoa; charred grain. The flavor mirrors the aroma only amplified; heavy milk chocolate and decadently savory cocoa sweetness; bitterness is there but buried deeply within the malt sweetness. Heavy body; rich and creamy; sludgy; mainly sweet mouthfeel but offset with some charred grain dryness. What a treat to enjoy a classic styled dark ale from a brewery known more for New England IPAs. This beer hits all the marks for the style. Its rich, sticky and decadent. A fantastic stout!"
4304,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.74,"Pitch black body, oily brown legs. The vanilla is absolutely decadent on the nose and palate, with the coconut being mild but mixing things up a bit.

4305,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.25,"2016 vintage. Black pour with a filmy beige head. Coffee leads the aroma, persitent but not overwhelming. Taste starts sweet, then the bitter coffee comes in. Barrel aging is evident at the finish, both with woody notes and hints of bourbon. Latent heat. 3 years on, still great."
4306,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.82,"Dark but vibrant chestnut brown, filling to 8 ball black, with a moderate tan foam fizzling out to a short ridged collar. First impression is really caramel forward, like salted dark caramel ice cream, very close to mimicking a local favorite from Jeni's, which has a delectably charred brown sugar and dulce de leche character to it. The body is smooth and viscous. There's a little toasty nut and a semi-bitter barrel char, but this is mostly in the English vein, being sweeter and more luxurious. A solid whiskey booze comes out at subsequent sips, while a soft but crackly fizz leads into a semi-dry swallow that's also semi-sticky on the lips. There are hints of dark fruits, but they're not so dark as prune--maybe a little more figgy with red grape, or even aspects of red wine or port. Toffee, nougat and candied nut aromas develop as it warms, adding layers of decadent complexity to this wonderful experience. At the same time, contrasting milk chocolate and black pepper also develop, moreso on the palate. For my money, this OG barleywine whale is still hitting on all cylinders."
4307,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.31,"Blend #4. A: Pours a murky, opaque, very dark brown with a smattering of foam which dissipates immediately. No lacing or retention. S: Candied dark fruit (plum, blackcurrant, grape), mild oak, vanilla, and cocoa, a bit of bourbon. T: Luscious dark fruit, moderate dark chocolate and bourbon, a bit of vanilla bean. Finishes with mild tannins that offset nicely the moderate sweetness/fruitiness.  M: Medium-full body with medium-light carbonation. Very mild alcohol warmth.  O: Overall, the aroma and flavors are fairly muted and—while solid—are nothing spectacular. The fruit character and mild sweetness are great, though."
4308,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.86,"2020 Release Appearance: Very dark brown with a modest sized dark beige head which faded fairly quickly. Nice looking Imperial Stout. Smell: Prominent Bourbon, cinnamon, coconut, brown sugar, and modest coffee aromas. The beer has a nice nose. Taste: The taste is what this beer is all about. The palate feature modest bourbon, cinnamon, coconut toffee/brown sugar, and dries out in the finish somewhat with some tannic oak notes. The taste profile is nicely balanced with the individual elements complementing each other very nicely. The beer has a mild alcohol presence for the listed 13.54% ABV. I seriously don't know what I would change here except a tad bit more coffee but if it affected the balance that would not be good. Mouth-feel: Full bodied with the carbonation is at a modest level that works very well resulting in a thick and nice mouthfeel in this beer. Overall: A very impressive beer. The taste profile is nicely balanced and cohesive with all the adjunct complementing each other very nicely. The only adjunct listed that I feel is underrepresented is the coffee but who really cares when it tastes this good. Beers like this are great inspirations to keep working on my home-brewing."

Big time fruit... baking cherry, raspberry, and cranberry. Some fruit sweetness to go with the tartness... oak and a bit of funk. Modest acidity... with some apple cider vinegar and tannins. Medium bodied... nice carbonation. More fruit and cherry to finish. O: Absolutely outstanding. Wish I had a case of this... and it made for a great 'end of the week' treat. Super complex and delicious and worthy of the high rating."

Once it warms, you get chocolate, little coffee presence but that's okay. It's good as it get but im not sure how will this age but hopefully you get to try this once, it's very worthwhile, cheers"
4313,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.14,"I've had it a billion times but I've never reviewed it and now that BA has nerfed everyone's karma I guess I have to. I guess being a member for 14 years and going to a dozen fests isn't enough. FBD was that friendly transitional beer between WCIPA and NEIPA for thousands of us and it's held up over the years. Still has that slightly ""unfinished"" ""it's brew day and I'm grabbing growlers"" feel to it, but not in a negative way."

4315,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.59,"This one is a throwback to the good old days of pine flavored IPA's. Pine and resin are the main aromas followed by citrus, and tropical hops in the foreground. Candy malt backbone to support the beer. Slight astringency. Strong bitterness that last for a while. Despite it's strength and bitterness I still find it very drinkable and the malts do a good job of supporting the more powerful flavors. Very good."

Aroma is sweet creamy coffee. Flavor is sweet creamy coffee, heavy on the cream. Extremely thick and viscous, amazing mouthfeel. Overall, this is truly an exceptional beer. 5/28/21 "
4319,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.35,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2017 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warmed, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal/roast/char bitterness, and bourbon/oak/pepper/cinnamon spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, dark/brown bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, leather, tobacco, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak/spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1% and pepper heat; with minimal barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial spiced stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/spicy/drying finish. Amazingly rich malt complexity, perfectly balanced spices, and bourbon barrel presence/integration. Not overwhelming on any aspect. A bit more soft and mellowed out on spice after the barrel aging. A highly enjoyable offering as expected. Liked it just a bit more than the base beer."
4320,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.48,"My youngest daughter gave me this for Christmas and had been bugging me to not wait too long to drink it (little does she know what's in my cellar). So I was waiting for the weather to cool down and today is it. 2019 poured into a DFH tulip. Brownish black body with a nice creamy head of tight bubbles with good retention. Smell is cinnamon upfront with not much coffee and deep roasty malts. Taste is big cinnamon with a bit of coffee and chocolate. Nicely complex. Can taste a bit of a booze burn when it warms but the balance on this is good enough that I'm not kicking myself for not aging this longer; at least not too much. Mouthfeel is beautifully creamy and that's what really sets this off. Usually with a big dark bomb like this I'm all about it being chewy but creamy really works. Just a fantastic experience. Thank you, Jenny Wren."
4321,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.68,"Big thanks to my best friend Jon Passow from A Starter and a Chaser podcast for sharing a bottle of this with me. Getting to try this certainly is a big beer milestone for me. Poured into a goblet glass, this beer pours a dark ruby color with some bright ruby/amber highlights when held up to the light. Has a just slightly off-white/tan head that's about half an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with a film layer of surface foam. Aromas of toasted, bready, caramel malts followed by dried fig, plum, yeasty esters, a hint of cocoa, a bit of leather, and hint of sweet , Red Delicious apple. Tastewise, the flavor profile is very similar, with the aforementioned toasted, caramel, bready malts along with plums, figs and just a hint of Red Delicious apple. This is followed by some Belgian Candy sugars along with a bit of yeastiness and just a hint of cocoa and leather here too. The flavor profile does change and get a bit more complex as the beer sits and warms up. Just an absolutely fantastic flavor profile. Has a smooth, fairly frothy, slightly creamy, also still somewhat crisp, medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish, and all the flavors stack around on the inside of my mouth on my palate for awhile after each sip. WOW! This is just a really excellent beer, and certainly the best beer of this style I've ever had. Eric"
4322,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.51,"Black in color with no penetration to light. The aroma is of cinnamon, chocolate fudge, vanilla, and whiskey. I’m tasting dark chocolate brownies, cinnamon, vanilla, and whiskey. The mouth is lusciously smooth and insanely drinkable for 13%."
4323,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,3.39,"Pours a bright, sunny yellow color, clouded, with a smaller white head, which disappears soon. The nose is defined by rubbery funk, mushrooms and lots of young peaches. Funk and fruits collide in a very gentle way, creating an intriguing complexity with peaches being the most prominent ingredient.  Has a sparkly effervescence, together with a mineralic quality, while providing a very refreshing, easy drinking, yet very acidic body.  Tastes of lime zest, cucumber water, old herbs, minerals and wet basement. Crisp and refreshing on the tongue, leaving the heavy mushroom funk from the nose behind, which gets replaced by unripe peaches. Peaches are definitely recognizable on the palate, while they are less well pronounced compared with the beer's aromas. They go hand in hand with a tongue bumbing tartness, while a fruity peach pulp note is able to cut through. The beer finishes calm and clean, with an everlasting sourness among an aqueous, mineral blend.  This is solid, well balanced and perfect for a warm summer day. Its tartness is pushing it though, reminding me of a classical AWA, hindering the beer from unfolding subtle notes."
4324,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,3.9,"2013 vintage; drank 11/20/14 @ California Split.  Murky tangerine color.  Minimal white head; minimal lace.  Tart apple nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  VERY tart apple flavor; one-note & way too sour for me, but bold & memorable."
4325,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.04,"2/8/21 - Opaque coffee, tan head, not big, recedes to a cap; An intriguing aroma, rich, sweet; Mouthfeel: smooth, mild carbonation; Rich robust flavor, alcohol; I think I prefer Founder's Breakfast Stout. I guess I need to do a taste test."
4326,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.39,"On tap at Lulu's in Allston, MA. Looks like a well-made NEIPA in the glass with a lovely stiff-peak eggwhite head that retains surprisingly well for the style. Aromas scream passion fruit, mango, and guava. Just a hint of pale malt character coming through. The passion fruit is strong in the flavors, too. Perhaps a hair on the tart side, had a bit of an apple cider vinegar character. Refreshing and quite drinkable. I definitely have my qualms with beers that are so heavily fruited they just take like unsweetened fruit spritzers, but I have to respect this one for how damn far they took it. This seems to be a slightly different recipe, the ABV is now 7%. 88/100"
4327,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.4,"Very balanced and drinkable. Not notable for a unique flavor, but a solid pale ale that I enjoy every time. Can't hold up to IPAs and DIPAs unless you're looking for something lighther."
4328,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.52,"Batch from June of 2017. Pours a dark rich red/purple with some carbonation. Smell is sweet pungent raspberry and earthy. Taste is tart, very refreshing, unabashedly raspberry. Dances the line between a fruity juice and a sour beer. Smooth and easy to drink. Really enjoyed it."
4329,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.24,2017 Vintage
4330,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.58,"Batch 2 (2016). A: Pours a deep amber with some brown highlights. A ring of off white head dissipates quickly. No lacing.  S: Plum, cherry, and raisin in the forefront with light toffee, chocolate, and sherry. A whisp of oak and bourbon are fairly well integrated, and a bit of alcohol peaks through.  T: Follows the nose with fruit-forward flavor (plum, raisin, cherry), very light toffee and barrel presence (a little too light). A medium sweetness lingers on the finish, maybe a bit sweeter than ideal but not terribly out of place for the style.  M: Full bodied, thick, with medium-light carbonation. Very mild alcohol heat, it’s surprising how easy this drinks given the ABV. O: A delicious treat. The barrel and caramel flavors take a back seat to the fruit, which is fine but I wish they were a little more prominent."
4331,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.79,"Def lived up to the Hype, exactly as I expected. Super smooth n drinkable. Lottsa flavor and extremely well balanced. Was worth the effort to get. I hope they bottle it every year."
4332,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.14,"05/2016 - The nose is super hot, with some dark chocolate, a crap ton of bourbon, and some vanilla; the palate is super boozy, with more bourbon, chocolate, and roast than the original; the finish is way too thin to make this super good. It's fun to try, but one and done for me."
4333,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.95,"For an IPA the smell and taste cannot get any better. A lot of Treehouse beers fade into memory as tasting a lot alike, great stuff but not individually memorable. However, Haze is such a unique standout. The ability to make hops taste both of peach and hops is amazing. By far my favorite Treehouse beer."
4334,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.05,"Look: This pours black with almost no carbonation. A thin tan bit if head dissipates quickly. Smell: Smells boozy with some chocolate, no much else. Taste: I get the strong booze backing a bitter dark chocolate, followed by slight vanilla. Where's the coconut? Feel: Like a standard Prairie, good viscosity the coats the tongue. But the booze overpowering the adjuncts gives it a quick finish that doesn't linger.  Compared to most Prairie Dawgs, this one lands at about a 4 because of the imbalance of booze/adjuncts and the lacking sweetness. (I love 90% dark chocolate so have no problem with bitter). It just doesn't go well here."
4335,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.2,"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Tree House snifter glass; canned on 11/20/20, code I'M FEELING HOTS HOTS,HOTS."
4336,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.47,Had on site at HF 8/18/2017. Decadent and smooth with just a hint of barrel (wish there was a little more). Extremely rich mouthfeel. So glad I was finally able to try this one. Definitely worth seeking out.
4337,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.78,Pours a light yellow with a one inch white almost champagne like head. Smells of lemon predominantly. Exquisitely light tart with lemon oakiness and light character from the wine barrel. Probably the best saison I have ever had.
4338,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.62,"Dark with a rich creamy tan head. Smells of coffee, smoke, maple and chocolate. Tastes follow the smell. Really sweet and a lot of coffee with the smokiness. Finishes with s char bitterness. Delicious beer."
4339,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.49,"Two day old growlette poured into a tulip glass.  L: Pours murky white golden with less than 1 finger of quickly dissipating white head that left minimal spotted lacing. S: Great nose, very tropical. Plenty of orange and mango, more subtle notes of passionfruit, pineapple and papaya.  T: Follows the nose to a large degree, but with more citrus prominence. Finishes with moderate bitterness and acidity, bitterness clears quickly while the acidity lingers. I liked that it wasn't crazy sweet juice. F: Medium bodied with medium-high carbonation, lively on the tongue with some burn from the carbonation and acidity, slick on the swallow.  O: Loved the nose and taste, didn't feel this hit the normal creamy mouthfeel of a Trillium NEIPA. Liked the bitterness element, and would gladly repeat if given the opportunity."
4340,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.79,This was a complete shocker to me. It's been the first bottle logic beer I've traded back. The thickness is really a turning point I think BL will continue with. No other BL beers to this date have produced this. For the longest time in CA after trading for East Coast beers I wondered why west coast stouts were so much thinner and finally I found something that reminded me of The Answer's Cinammon Papa Boi but bourbon barrel aged. Beyond the thickness I'll admit I have 2 bottles and the first had more Cinammon than the second albeit not overwhelming. It being siagon and not straight cassia bark perhaps made it more exotic. The coffee profile was unreal. Just so decadent overall. A real shocker didnt know BL could do this.
4341,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.75,"Pours a hazy bright orange color with a thick, soapy white head and sticky lacing. The smell explodes with orange from several feet away. There's also strong grapefruit, underripe mango, and a hint of pineapple. The taste is orange, orange zest, grapefruit, a hint of floral, and a strong bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is velvet smooth, medium/low carbonation, and medium/thick body. Overall, this is really enjoyable, very well done, and a really big beer."
4342,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.31,"Pours a viscous motor oil with no lacing. Nose is cherry, chocolate, balsamic vinegar up front followed by warmth of vanilla from the bourbon. Taste follows the nose well blended of cherry, balsamic, followed by vanilla and chocolate and finishes with a nice acidity and barrel. Feel is viscous (milk) for a wild/sour with minimal carb to clean the pallet. Overall, this is a great beer for a dark sour and all the flavors blend well, the"
4343,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.44,Pours a dark chocolate color. Aroma is mellow barrel with a touch of Carmel vanilla boozines. Flavor follows the nose. Nice chocolate with some char and a good Carmel vanilla bourbon flavor. A little thin but overall fantastic.
4344,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,1.36,"It tastes like beer mixed with copious amounts of honey. A friend of mine drove all the way to Boston, snagged a bunch of Trillium beer, brought them back to CT, and a sampling we did do. I wish Cutting Tiles wasn't the first one I tried. It reminded me of drinking Dundee's Honey Brown Lager back in high school. I was tempted to ""accidentally"" spill my glass off his deck to avoid further punishment, but there were kids underneath playing laser tag, and I was afraid of spilling it on them. Imagine having to rescue them from a bee attack or a bear attack if they were laced in Cutting Tiles. I thoroughly enjoyed the other varieties, but the 4.5 point World Class reviews for this beer are completely misleading. I think the beer is just riding the coattails of Trillium's other quality recipes. I desperately want to blind taste test some users on this site. This beer is terrible. Save yourself the drive, buy a double Mosaic IPA that somehow tastes like a pilsner, and stir in about a half a cup of honey and there you go, Cutting Tiles. Also, if you like tea and honey, try tea and Cutting Tiles. Oh, and I heard they're partnering with General Mills to make Cutting Tiles Nut Cheerios. Honey Boo-Boo is changing her name to Cutting Tiles Boo-Boo."
4345,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.65,"Great beer with a stellar coffee profile. Look and mouthfeel leave a bit to be desired, but the beer makes up for it with a coffee-forward nose and flavor that is superior to the majority of beers in this style. The barrel comes through as well."
4346,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.05,eyes...
4347,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,3.83,"Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2018 vintage. A -Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice oily black hue with a thick mocha head that fades to leave a creamy blanket and light legs. S - Aromas of sweeter malts, super dark roast, nice fudgy chocolate but the barrel isn't super pretend. T - Taste is similar to the nose with rather sweeter malts. Roasted malts and charred oak, almost briney. The finish is super unpleasant, like campfire minus the smoke with a little soy sauce. M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, alcohol hidden but the finish is rubbish. O - Overall this was a very underwhelming beer. It's decent enough but the finish is super unpleasant. Serving Type: can"
4348,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.48,"2020 vintage (green wax); consumed on 10/27/20 Pours an inky, jet-black body trailed in turn by a cascading, rocky, deep mocha foam; great head retention withers steadily to a foggy sliver of cap, a massive, creamy collar, and walls of lacing clinging briefly to the glass. Aroma begins with subtle dark fruits alongside a building barrel presence, invoking details of rich caramel, light oak, and a subtle vanilla; a depth surges in waves over the middle, bringing a healthy combo of fresh cacao nibs and milk chocolate alternating prominence; raisin, a minor (though brilliantly leveled) ethanol, brown sugar, and dark cherry esters accent the back end of the bouquet as chocolate pudding closes and lingers through the nose. Taste opens with splintery oak carrying the weight of dark malts, which calmly evolves to more toasted notes of caramel, brown sugar, lush bakers chocolate, and a fluffy, pipe tobacco-imbued roast; cherry 'pops' against decadent, oaky vanilla and a soft nuttiness over the mid-palate and forms a vanilla frosting character on back end, where dusty tones of hot chocolate leave the final impression. Mouthfeel offers a near-comprehensive full body, showing a chewy texture balanced against a low-moderate, pillowy carbonation; a slick, malty grit eases through the mid-palate with an evenly dispersed ethanol warmth lurking beneath and a splintery dryness prickle developing through an oily back end; an impactful rounding of robust, malt roast assures a totality to the finish/swallow. A graceful, classically-styled barrel-aged stout, layering waves of chocolate and an intrinsic whiskey undertone atop the ideal body, plush as it embraces the subtleties of a mild-moderate boozy heat. The barrel itself is sweet, but sees the malt profile flourish with near-perfect integration, coming to form one of the more exhaustively pleasing samples of an unadjuncted barrel-aged beer one is likely to come across."
4349,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.37,Look - Just fantastic thick hazy slightly tannish orange with a creamy white head that last with great skimming and lacing
4350,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.78,"Tasted from can. Thick and chewy. Sticky goodness. Lots of bourbon, caramel and molasses on aroma and taste. Some dark fruits, raisins, dates, brown sugar and maple along with the caramel molasses on taste. Incredible English barleywine."

Not overly sweet, enjoying this around the campfire and I couldn’t think of a more perfect beer for the occasion. Easily a top 100 beer"
4353,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.23,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours jet black with minimal head. Nose is bursting with notes. Cinnamon, coconut, very dark chocolate, bourbon, black licorice, burnt toffee, blackberries, and honey. I'm not getting much coffee on the nose. The nose, to me, is not overly complex. That said, I don't think it needs to be. The taste is really nice. Tons of cinnamon and coconut - probably the most dominant flavors. The bourbon is there, but not really dominant. The cinnamon is very strong. It tastes as described. The coffee is there, but I don't get a heavy hit of it. the mouthfeel is crazy - this, to me, is where this beer really stands out. Super thick and creamy. Almost pours as a syrup. Overall, this is a great beer, but definitely not something I would buy again for the price."
4354,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,3.6,"Kids! Always bring back Trillium when you visit Boston! Like you didn’t know that. 16 oz. can dated 10/4/18. The pour is thick, phlegm-like yellow that smells like grapefruit perfume cut with pine. Not bad.  Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point leans hard enough into grapefruit it might fall out of the car. Grapefruit for kilometers, kiwi, spring florals, touch of mint, with a nice bitter finish. Dry. Easy enough to drink, which might be its calling card.  I can’t speak for the masses (but I will anyways), but this appears to be a classic case of “this is Trillllllium!”-itis. A good, solid beer, but nothing to rise above many others, especially with all the genuinely excellent beers in their portfolio."
4355,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.58,"Bottle, 2019 release:"
4356,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.18,"2019 version on draft at Cigar City. Poured a black body with minimal khaki head and this tiny khaki lace ring that stuck around. The aroma comes across as spicy, the cinnamon and chilies grabbing the nose, with minor chocolate sweetness underneath the spice. Smooth, silky, has some sticky sweetness despite how easy it is to drink. Chili and cinnamon balance with chocolate and vanilla, just enough booze for a complementary finish, and even mild notes of dark fruits like figs (not so much plum). Just a bit of everything in this beer and it is flavorful and so easy to drink."
4357,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.45,"Mostly clear chestnut brown with dark tinting, no head save a thin off-white ring. Lovely and expressive red wine barrel with oak, brett, lacto, dried cherry, currant, and sour plum. Taste really does stand out, was skeptical given the hype and specifically the age of the hype, but the red wine makes this sour, playing with the oak, fruits including the addition of green apple and date, flowers, funk, brett, and lacto really well. Almost has a wine pouched cherry aftertaste with oak. Starts wet and vinous, but slowly and steadily makes its way to a drier and wood tannin laden finish, with green sour and funky textures in between, with all three phases melding into one another, best aspect of the beer. Stands the test of time, well done!"
4358,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.44,"Well this was one expensive four-pack, six bucks higher than the pseudo-sue. I had no idea it would be one of the top IPAs, I just like the fossil Sue. So I spent money I didn't have, and here we are.  And I think... Well damn, it's pretty friggin' good. They weren't screwing around here. Oily, resinous hops abound. Thick and chewey, like a meal of hops. Lingering dry bitterness in the throat.  Kinda makes you feel like a giant, non-avian therapod with a hankering for lawyers."
4359,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.41,"Poured into a snifter. Very hazy bright yellow color with a modest white head. Big tropical, grassy, and earthy aroma. Taste followed: pineapple, berries, mango, grass, and dank flavors. Smooth, full-bodied, and soft bitterness. One of my favorite TIPAs."
4360,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.75,"I had been wanting to try this one for a very long time and it didn't disappoint at all. So much apricot, but not too sweet and very drinkable. This one lived up to the hype."

Pitch black beer with a three finger high, mocca-colored head that leaves lacing on the glass.  Nose: Wow! Bourbon, vanilla, coffee, fudge, chocolate, maple syrup, a hint of cinnamon, grain, marshmallows and sugar. "
4362,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.75,"Multiple pours via tap DLD Pours pitch black with mocha colored head that dissipates quickly. Thick, sticky, stains the glass gold with a swirl. Nose is fantastic. Huge cinnamon (much bigger cinnamon presence than 2017), sweet brown sugar, spices, oak, vanilla, peppery notes. Taste is big cinnamon up front. Spiciness comes through, and sweetness on the back end. Chocolately. Feel is typical dark lord, viscous, thick, syrupy. Overall, incredible. Easily tops last year. Cinnamon toast with chocolate milk."

4364,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.88,"03/2015 - This is absolutely incredible - the nose is big bourbon, dark chocolate, roast, and some vanilla, too; the mouthfeel is velvety, luscious, and full on whiskey, yet there isn't any ethanol; the finish slightly sweet, yet the roast and barrel linger in a wonderful union that lasts and lasts."
4365,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.76,"2017 Vintage, poured into a tulip. Velvety coffee balanced well with chocolate notes and roasted malts. Super thick mouthfeel, which makes this one elite."
4366,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,5.0,Excellent execution of the Mayan mocha style. The rye barrel spice marries wonderfully with the adjunct profile the abraxas provides. Absolutely unique and a legendary beer amongst the pastry scene. All hail the king.
4367,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.85,"An outstanding beer among world class IPAs that TH is putting out. Full juice box smell and taste but I think some of their others have the mouthfeel that sets TH apart from just about every other brewery. That said, do not pass up the opportunity to sample this. Glad to see it warranted their full can label, similar to Julius, Green, etc... an indicator this will be in their regular rotation."
4368,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.67,"375ml bottle, Batch 5, dated March 18, 2015, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. The beer pours a bright golden color, hazy and cloudy with a finger of white, soapy head that has good retention and yields plenty of lacing. The aroma is excellent, great funk, nice and bright, soft oak, light vinous acidity, floral with a touch of sweet pale dough and some berry fruit. The flavors are excellent, beautifully balanced and layered, lovely funk, softly tart citrus, berry fruit, bright white wine grape, lightly acidic with an incredible floral bouquet, soft chewy oak plays with the pale doughy malt, a touch of spice and soft pitted stone fruits. The mouthfeel is excellent, coating and creamy, medium body that is so gentle and soft with the easiest of finishes that is lightly tart. Verdict: An incredible saison from Hill Farmstead, beautifully balanced, bright and delicate, just an exceptional beer. It’s soft and approachable and effortlessly complex."
4369,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.37,2015 vintage
4370,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.71,"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a semi-hazy almost burnt orange color with a thin wisp of a white head that quickly dissipated. Light bubbles of broken head float around the top. Light wispy lacing. The smell takes in sweet danky onion sliding on into through resinous pine and then a light grapefruit underneath. The taste had a full bittersweet flavor revolving around the resinous piney part. Dry resinous aftertaste leads into a dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body. ABV, whoah, where did that go? Its not really there, well hidden. Overall, wow, just wow, just an absolutely stellar job by HF. I’d love to have this again."
4371,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.48,From Labor Day weekend notes:
4372,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,3.98,Canned fall 2016; drank 10/15/16 @ the Palace.  Opaque orange juice appearance.  HUGE white head; frothy lace.  Orange citrus & grapefruit notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Fresh orange citrus flavor up front; mild grapefruit bite on the finish.  Very fruit forward; simple but effective.
4373,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.06,"Canned 20 days ago. L — Bright golden orange body with quite a bit of noticeable hop particulate in suspension. Huge, 4-finger solid white head produced with moderate pour. Looks like this thing is carbonated up the wazoo, has that Alchemist look to it	"
4374,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,3.9,Tan head. Caramel brown color. Lots of oak and wood. Brown sugar and toffee. Cherries and raisins. Some bourbon and vanilla. Has an odd strawberry flavor to it. Medium bodied. Very interesting bwine. Very unique.
4375,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.55,"wow! thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing this rare gem, its always a pleasure to get to share these with close friends. this might represent the final evolution of the apricot wild ale, and after being only lukewarm on the west ashley (in regards to all the hype), this one really takes it to the next level. twice the apricots and twice the time in barrels! the pour is hazy short of rusted orange, pale and soft looking, no visible particulate in here, but still sort of raw looking. nearly a full inch of airy white head lingers. the aroma here is near perfection, about is forward as apricots have ever been, including allagash, cascade, crooked stave, and yes, cantillon too. its juicy and bright, sweet enough, even fuzz on the outside just a little bit. oddly nutty like the pits but that could be a handover from the wood. the fruit is pulpy and ripe and dominant, but there is a great mixed culture sourness backing it up, cutting the sweet, and highlighting some of the wheaty grain base and oak treatments, all well integrated and powerful, but also quite mellow and approachable as they go. the flavor is still really ripe apricots and interesting funk and sour combined. the fruit is incredible here, maybe a step short of its explosive aroma, but really pungent and to the point. it tastes like a fresh apricot in the peak of the season, as true to the fruit as any of the beers out there. its quite sour too, a lot of lactic acidity, ahead of the wild funk aspects, and well ahead of the oak. it gets even more sour as it warms, which it does in this instance because i cant put my glass down to stop smelling it! a bottle of this might be a lot as a solo mission, so i was really glad to be sharing it. i could see the acidity getting overwhelming. its like too much of a good thing, a third of a bottle was exactly perfect. probably the best expression of apricots i have seen in a beer, and the white wine notes from the wood and the yeasts are a great compliment to the fruit. easily the best of the beers i have had from these guys, and probably the new benchmark in the style. unlike the west ashley, this is entirely worth all of the high praise it gets! a memorable experience."
4376,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.9,"Served at 4°C. Brown dark amber, slightly opaque, brownish foam immediately disappearing, highly carbonated."
4377,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.29,"On-tap at Chupacabra in Mesa, AZ: Pours golden with a white head. White lacing sticks. The smell is of huge tropical and citrus notes with some tangerine and pine that is musty in a good way. The taste is of tropical and citric fruits, tangerine and a touch of pine. Some solvent alcohol, but overall the alcohol is well-integrated. Nice bitter bite in the finish. Smooth - not too hot despite some noticeable alcohol (as expected for abv level). A very enjoyable hop-forward imperial IPA!"
4378,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.56,"Appearance: With a nice hearty, vigorous pour, the beer produced about a 2.5 finger of soft, white foamy head. About half of the foam laced the glass after about a minute or two of sitting. Aroma: It smells of wine barrel, oak, tart cherry and other fruity aromas. Taste: On the first sip, I pick up some tart funk, some straw, some wine barrel. At the very end of the sip, there is a really subtle, slight bitter finish. It is really refreshing and enjoyable. Mouthfeel: It seems to carry a lower carb feel to it, but it works for me Overall: This lived up to the hype for me. It was a really good, enjoyable beer for me. I like what the wine barrels did to the overall taste of the beer. Thanks to jhavs for making this one happen."
4379,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.84,"From a 16oz can dated 12/16/20 into a pint glass. Can message: ""Double tha Juice"" Pours an opaque yellowish, light brownish orange with about two fingers of thick white head. Amazing lacing and retention. This beer is thick and viscous looking. Smells of mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit, oranges and a bit of floral and earthy notes. Taste picks up where the nose left off. There is a strong bitter piney back end to the sip. The beer feels thick but soft. Unbelievably drinkable. Strong bitter aftertaste. Low carbonation. This was a gift from a friend. Can't believe he gave this to me. Probably the best beer I've had from Tree House."
4380,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.81,"Not at all for the faint of heart, this massive barleywine of ale is a testament to what ale can be and not of what anyone prescribes what it should be. High succulent charms the senses with slow-sipping rewards, patience is rewarded while basking in the indulgence of what's best about cognac, bourbon and oak. Double oaked A Deal With The Devil pours with a highly viscous weight while glossing the glass with such brandy legging and sugary weight. Tawny mahogany in color, the beer's appearance gives way to breath taking aromas of brown sugar, toffee, molasses, chocolate, wine and a cognac and sherry glazed boozy spice. The combination of bourbon and cognac carries the full force of blackstrap molasses, sorghum, brown sugar and the unexplainable savory taste of extended aged sherry. The beer explodes on the middle palate as the booze-soaken fruits of fig, date, raisin, red grape, plum, blackberry and prune all represent the macerated character of the most savory fruit tar to exist. Oxidation notes nearly extend past port and sherry and into the world of teriyaki and soy sauce with a kiss of fudge. Playfully tangy, the sweet and heat of the late palate, balances with a lavish malty rich taste and a spicy, sassy finish. Full, chewy and pleasantly cloying, the most supple of sips quickly reach across the palate and saturate the tastebuds completely with the sweetness of butter rum, butter pecan and an elegant richness that satisfies the sweet tooth and the need for all-things-savory all at once. Its forever long finish closes with an afterglow of seared sweetness, fortified wines and lavish malt richness."
4381,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.25,"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle into a stemmed wine glass. Purchased in Attleboro MA. Pours a muddy hazy brown body with an off white head that reduces to a single layer with some spotty lacing. Aromas are lactic with dark fruits with some oak. Taste is pretty sour with cherries and dark fruits, lactic sourness, slightly acetic, sherry, definitely sweet, plums, brown sugar. Finish is tannic. Medium body with medium low carbonation."
4382,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,5.0,Had this on draft on site at De Garde.
4383,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.22,"B2 shared on 8-19-18(Fermier Day). Pours on the lighter shade of ruby(it was the lightest shade compared with Quetsche, Kriek, and Bluet). Nice raspberry funk on the nose. An initial raspberry flavor hits the palate, but for some strange reason quickly fades as my acidic ""woo"" reaction kicks in. I've read so many reviews here with the same ""jam/jammy"" comments, and I was very disappointed when I finally got to try this coveted brew, because those 2 words are far from the truth. Jam is sweet, something you put on bread(or crackers if you really want to be Mr. Fancy Pants). This beer is strongly acidic, dare I say overly so."
4384,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.59,"Sweet pineapple, tropical hoppy, and piney dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a juicy and soft tropical hoppy bitterness...some dank bitter notes come out and linger a while on the finish. Well-balanced! Really good!"
4385,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.8,This is like Nelson on crack. So delicious. Barely noticeable ABV. One Alpine beer you know you're getting from their production and not Green Flash. Must try. Another winner from Alpine.
4386,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.5,"Pour is jet black, thick tan head. Aromas are led by the barrel, but the dark chocolate aromas are present, as is the honey. The taste has the dark chocolate evolving to a rich cocoa flavor, which may be the combination of the dark chocolate flavors and the honey. Whatever it is, I absolutely LOVE it. There's also a boozy burn present, but it's well onto the back of the palate, and isn't overwhelming in any way. I wish I'd purchased three bombers of this, because it is exceptionally well executed."
4387,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,"2020 Bottle. Absolutely bonkers Maple Syrup on the nose. Coffee opens up after a minute, but this beer straight up nails the syrup-soaked French Toast profile. Hate the small-format bottles.. wanted more!"
4388,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,"I tried this alongside my previous favorite beer - the Evil Twin Aún Más A Jesús. This was clearly better. Unfortunately, I tasted close to 20 other top rated beers that day, and I didn't take any notes for a thorough review. But I know my scoring is accurate, as this and the Aún Más A Jesús were the first two beers I tasted that night. To me, this is the best of the best."
4389,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.5,"Poured from a bottle (2017 vintage) into a small tasting glass L: pours a nice very dark black brown with a moderate tan khaki head. Fades after a minute or so, leaves a nice ring of foam around the edge when it does S: nice and inviting nose, full without coming across heavy or sweet. Great chocolate aroma to open, solid roast coffee comes through as well. There’s a bit of cinnamon spice coming through as well, adds some nice complexity but doesn’t become a dominant note. A bit more cinnamon as it’s warmed, along with a small bit of abv heat T: follows the nose well, a great dark chocolate note with dark roast coffee notes shining as well. That cinnamon comes through to add some nice depth, but again more playing a supporting role than really acting as a main flavor. This was as it was cold from the fridge - as it’s warmed that cinnamon comes through more, still not aggressive but a nice addition to the chocolate. Medium-long finish, with a nice bitter coffee/dark chocolate coming through. Abv works very well, provides that warming character without coming across hot F: medium body, medium carbonation, would have liked it a bit thicker but not sure if that’s me thinking stout vs. winter warmer (what is the appropriate body for the style?) O: a really nice winter warmer (not that I’ve had many in the style). Solid nose, great flavor - some age in the bottle has muted the adjuncts but I’d say they still come through well"
4390,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,3.73,"16oz can - Double Dry Hopped version Pours a small finger of white head into my willi becher glass, a little soapy looking, dissipates quickly. Good initial lacing. Body looks like orange juice. Meh, looks ok I guess. Nose is pretty juicy, loaded with grapefruit, some mango. Dank, piney hops linger underneath the fruit. Small amount of creamy wheat present as well.  Pretty nice job of staying balanced between traditional hop aromas, and fruit. Not an “American pale ale” by any means, as their website says, regardless, smells pretty good. Flavor is good, but doesn’t quite have that crisp refreshing punch I’m looking for. A little under carbonated, and while the hops are there, they don’t help make up for the lack of carbonation with any real mouthfeel contributions – drinks like juice. As for actual flavors, mostly those dank piney hops come through. Grapefruit is a secondary flavor, mango is not really present. I’m glad the hearty hop notes are the ones that are shining, yet it is still missing something - perhaps a little watery in some areas. At times, it’s hard to differentiate between poor mouthfeel, and flavor. Definitely not a sweet NE style, which again, is good. Tastes good, but has its issues. Not much else to say about mouthfeel that hasn’t already been said, under carbonated, a little watery, bitterness does not linger, not too sweet. Overall sub par. The drinkability is very high, it’s not a perfect beer, but it’s very tasty and unoffensive. Appearance turned out decent I guess. Lacing was patchy to say the least, but better than nothing. Overall it’s a tasty brew that hits home with the right flavors, but it is a little derailed by a low carbonation and watery taste/feel."
4391,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.42,"L - 1-finger dense, creamy offwhite cap of a head atop a gorgeous, orange juice body. S - grapefruit, pineapple, herb. T - incredible grapefruit flavors. Juicy flesh, bitter rind, with a touch of balancing dankness. Clean middle, with a dry finish. Moderate bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness. F - medium-full body with slightly below average carb. O - she’s a beaut, Clark. A beaut."
4392,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.2,Pours clear copper orange. Smallish white head. 
4393,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.15,"On tap at Weldwerks. Coconut and boozy barrel aroma. Flavor is extremely sweet, mild coconut and nice booze. This is some heavy stuff but it was one of the better noches I have tasted."
4394,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.52,"330cl brown bottle poured into a chalice.  Four finger dense foam thick taupe foam cap. Excellent retention. After five minutes settles to a dense foam layer with lacings and mountains over a dark cola like appearance  Aroma is as malty, brown bread , raisin, fig, whiff of spice  Taste is malty, brown bread, fig, raisin  Mouthfeel has big sudsing, fizzy, lighter mouthfeel , rich, creamy , sudsy . Hint of Alcohol with no burn  Good beer"
4395,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.43,"On-tap at Hops Hill, Brooklyn, NY A: The beer is very hazy to cloudy dark yellowish white in color. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that left lots of thick lacing down the sides of the glass and a thin webbing of bubbles on the surface."
4396,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.63,"05/2015 - An absolutely incredible, juicy, fruity, dank, spritzy, delicious Fort Point variation. It's a bit danker, bolder, yet juicier version of its younger brother."
4397,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.54,Super sweet..rum is prominent in the taste and nose..get a little bit of chocolate on the back end..but the rum flavor is king here..alcohol is well hidden on this beast of a stout
4398,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.51,"L: Chalky-opaque cantaloupe/grapefruit juice hued brew with two fingers of beige froth of average retention and a nice web of lace on the glass. S: Definitely more green than Green! Mild tropical fruits and melon punctuated by peppercorn, chives, and even a slight smoke. T: The palate follows the nose with some dank and wet wool notes. F: A nice bold mouthful. Smooth. A bit on the chewy side of filling. O: This one was a nice surprise, like the can notes though, I wouldn’t want to drink many in a season. It’s a lot to take on."
4399,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.92,"smells like a 2012 stout recipe. a tad perfume-y. reminds me of the Eclipse series.... really well done. sometimes it's hard to realize something that comes close to flawless unless we have the accompanying hype, but this is very good. also makes we want to go back and find those Eclipse bottles...."
4400,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,3.57,"Thanks to Pinz412 for this one, from a box in NBS BIF #13. 16oz can (dated 2/11/21) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a clean, clear, bright copper color with an inch of white head that had good retention and very light lacing. Bright, citrusy hops topped caramel malts in the nose. Very similar on the tongue, with a very nice bitterness to keep the tastebuds awake. The body was medium-full, a bit coarse across the palate, and had a dry finish. Drinkability was good, easy to see this being in rotation if it were local. Overall, a very nice brew. Certainly worth your time if you see it."
4401,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.38,"Had it at the Fat Heads in Pittsburgh. Met up with a cousin and his wife that I haven’t seen in 20 years, had a great time.  Started the evening with this beer, was happy to see it on the tap list. Served in a snifter. Clear golden yellow color with excellent head and lacing. Pine smell and taste. Strong citrus and vanilla. Classic imperial IPA! Happy to get it on tap! Had a wonderful time at the tap house!"
4402,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.5,"CBS is dark brown, essentially black. Shiny, completely opaque, and viscous. Huge khaki colored head forms with an aggressive pour. Once formed, the head slowly begins to collapse until a thin layer of foam remains on top of the beer. Lots of tan lacing remains on the glass.  CBS has notes of coffee, roasted malts, a touch of pine, with notes of oak, bourbon, smoke and a sweet tantalizing hint of maple coming through. Balanced is what comes mind to describe this aroma. CBS has some nice roasted malts up front, bourbon, oak, a touch of pine and lots of coffee come through up front. At some point, the palate suddenly picks up this subtle, but noticeable sweet maple note. The bourbon comes through on the back end with some heat. Again, the coffee, the maple, the base stout and the barrel aging is all present, all noticeable, but no one component dominates the flavor profile.  CBS is medium to full bodied. Really smooth with moderate carbonation. Somewhat drier on the finish. CBS is a beer that is remarkably good, but I think that these days it does not get the credit or accolades that it once did in large part due to what I think its is greatest ""virtue"" - balance. Its got barrel aging, coffee, maple, but it lets each component shine without outshining any of the others."
4403,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.03,"Pours a grainy golden. There's a dank note that you may smell in some parts of the city where youths are skipping class to take part in other, once questionable, but not decriminalized in some states behavior. It smells like week and there is definitely a note of it in flavor too. There's a quiet peppery bitterness on the finish. Overall, it's well-made, just not even my favorite beer involving Nelson from Hill."
4404,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.6,Very thankful for a good friend that went to the Abraxas release this year and then shared each of the variants at bottle shares. I love the regular Abraxas. But the coffee variant adds an awesome layer to an already great beer.
4405,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.21,"Reviewed on 4/29/16, from notes L - Pours oily black no head."
4406,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.7,"Tasted from bottle. 17 version. Black with minimal beige head. Aroma is a little smokey, roasted, bourbon, cured meats, bourbon. Flavors of bourbon, toffee, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, slight chili. Complex and delicious."
4407,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.82,Jan 2021 New Years Day
4408,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.5,"750ml bottle, first blend from the Casey side of the collaboration. Served in a stemmed glass. Pours a beautiful, hazy medium yellow body, one finger white head, great retention. Pretty much identical to Side Project's version. Smell is dripping with peach juice. It's more aggressive on the nose. But also more aggressive is the lactic acidity, which is a bit surprising as typically it is the Side Project that tends to have a reputation for being more acidic. A bit of cheese, fair bit of oak, mild dusty funk, but the nose is driven by peaches, and there are peaches for days! Flavour is a bit more skewed in favor of the acidity. Heavy lactic acidity with a touch of lemon seems to be the main theme here. Same big peach flavour, but it is slightly overshadowed. Dusty funk, oak rounds things out. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, but as said before, it is pretty heavy on the lactic acidity. I don't mind it certainly, but I am wishing it was dialed back a bit so I could get even more of the peach on the background of oak and dust. That being said, I enjoyed this one a bit more than the Side Project version. Everything about SP's version that was so well done has been amplified up to a 11. So I guess it depends on what you are looking for and what your preferences are."
4409,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.86,"Canned 4/18/21. Poured at 54°. Three fingers of rocky white foam with a creamy dome; some clarity under a long lasting cap; opaque medium amber color; heavy ring and heavy lace sheets the glass from first to last sip. Orange, lemon, pineapple, mango fruit punch nose. Taste follows nose with passion fruit and guava; bitter lemon rind; firm semi sweet malt base; finish is a melange of tropical fruit. Juicy yet soft creamy feel; medium body; no astringency; no warmth from 8.2% abv; light carbonation. Overall, great balance of citrus and tropical fruit flavors, bitter hops and sweetness from the malt; so easy on the palate I could happily drink another; one of the best DIPAs I’ve had; delicious!"
4410,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.74,"Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. 2017 edition L: Inky black pour... comes out like oil with 2 fingers of foamy tannish head. Modest lacint. S: Rich and roasty... cinnamon and spice, cocoa, and espresso. T.F: Just like it smells... rich with burned sugars and roast. Some sweetness up front... strong spice flavors, with cinnamon and vanilla... the chilis are also there giving some smokiness in the background. Strong cocoa... lighter coffee. Complex and lush with a ton going on. Creamy and thick bodied... warming, and it gets better as it warms. O: An elite stout... a big huge beer... great to relax with for an evening. Worthy of the hype."
4411,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,3.93,"2019 vintage. Released about nine months ago.  A: Pours jet black with a thick cap of dark brown, large bubbled head. Dissipates quickly, leaving a thin ring. So-so retention and no lacing. S: Ground cinnamon dominates, with an undertone of blackened roast, dark roast coffee, light oak, dark chocolate bar, and a bit of black licorice, whiskey, plum, sherry-like oxidation, and vanilla.  T: Cloyingly sweet. Again, ground cinnamon is overwhelming, alongside a little black licorice, plum, dark melted chocolate, whiskey, and a bit of oak on a long, sweet, cinnamon-y, slightly hot finish.  M: Medium-full body, a bit chewy, medium-light carbonation. Medium-light alcohol warmth with a slight burn.  O: What a mess. The cinnamon addition and barrel don’t save a base beer that is utterly hopeless. The cinnamon is dialed up too much and dominates the aroma and flavor. The barrel character is nearly non-existent. The sweetness is overwhelming."
4412,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.42,"01/2016 - incredible peach aromas, plus white wine, oakiness coming through; acidic as all hell on the palate and finish; slightly sweet, peachy keen, and barnyard on the palate, too; flavorful, spritzy finish."
4413,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.63,"330 ml bottle poured into a goblet A- A reddish dark brown with a three finger light tan head. S- Figs, dark fruits, caramel, candied sugar, touch of bananas, a little earthy. T- Dark fruits, figs, earthy, some caramel, candied sugar, earthy, hints of bananas. M- Smooth, light to medium body, dry. O- An excellent and extremely well balanced Dubbel."
4414,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.5,"Bourbon and fudge. Simple, well crafted and delicious. Founders does it again. I get some toasted coconut on the finish as well leaving me wanting a mounds bar. Definitely worthy of the price of admission."
4415,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.5,"Pours a hazy orange color with a think off-white head that sticks around forever and leaves thick lacing. The smell is dominated by hoppy orange and orange zest. The taste is slightly bitter orange, orange peel, with a bitter, slightly malty finish that lingers. The mouthfeel is medium body and carbonation and a bit oily. Overall, this is really, really good. Probably better than the double."
4416,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.63,"Hazy yellowish-orange with a big foamy head. Aroma is lemon, grass, pine, blueberry. Taste is citrusy, especially lemon with a strong bitterness. Also blueberry flavor from the Mosiac hops. Juicier and fruitier than Heady Topper, which is more piney and astringent."
4417,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.16,"Pours foggy golden orange that drops to a murky transparency when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. Head is near null with only a bit of fizz rising to the top and disappearing - akin to a glass of Champagne. Aroma is dry green grapes, tart green apple and lemon zest in a white wine, champagne-esque display. Light sour twist to it. Flavor profile continues the tart green apple and dry green grape story-line. Interwoven are notes of lemon zest, cellar stone, grapefruit and peach. Finish is lightly sour, with light-bodied, citrus sugary notes lingering long after the finish. Mouth feel is characterized by a moderately soft effervescence that only opens up after the initial sharp, energized effervescence decays. It has a medium, middle of the road, consistency. Overall, very unique. Lightbodied sourness mingles with dry green grapes and tart green apple to form a beer styled after champagne and white wine. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 375mL bottle."
4418,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.58,"Sweet, white wine grape, tropical hoppy, and orange citrus aromatics on this one! Taste follows exactly! This is very well-balanced between the different hop profiles...finishes with a nice orange/grapefruit citrus bitterness. This has really good depth and a juicy mouthfeel. This is great!"
4419,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.22,"A gift from a friend. 2 days old. The nose brings grassy hops, pineapple, and melon without screaming 'citrus' like most. The taste is intense. Nothing short of an explosion of hops and citrus flavor. Every kind of hops quality is present here. Herbal, citrusy, bitter, grassy. It's all here. It's like being punched in the tongue. The bitter aftertaste weighs a bit heavy for me. Pineapple, guava, and other fruits are contributors, but not the stars. Feel is nice and smooth with medium carbonation. It doesn't feel heavy or have noticeable alcohol heat.  Stamped on the bottom is: ""Cully eat's pizza with utensils"". 'Eat's'? Seriously? I would expect as much from a band that can't even spell greern."
4420,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.38,"2015 Vintage, poured into a tulip. Mellow barrel, chocolate, vanilla and almond. A little thin and on the sweet side but still very enjoyable and a considerable step up from the base beer."
4421,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.52,"Canned 8/11/21 ""Be good to each other"" stamped on the bottom of the can. Some words to live by these days Here it is, the final (?) evolution of Tree House's Haze series, at least at the time being. I've been outspoken in the past about thinking that Haze is one of their lower tier beers, though still quite good in the field of below average, fruit bomb NEIPAS. Very Hazy was a marked improvement over the original, so I'm hoping to keep the upward trend going with this one. Let's see just how hazy it is Pours a hazy radiant gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing It is certainly like a fruit cocktail in the nose, evocative of a scorpion bowl at an Asian restaurant. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, dank mango, pineapple juice, maraschino cherry, peppery hops, a touch of spruce, and bready malt to round it out This hits a different region of the TH IPA game, falling more into the earthy and malty category rather than aggressively fruity, and it works out quite nice for this one. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting fresh cut grass, pineapple juice, orange pith, and doughy malt. The swallow brings notes of pithy grapefruit, doughy malt, juicy peach, juniper berry, peppery hops, and a creeping long finish of bananas foster to bring it back around to the sweet aroma A medium full body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy and thick beer. Finishes off dry with an herbal character that nearly takes over This is one hell of a unique one for Tree House, and it is very good. Easily one of my favorite beers from them thus far, such a huge improvement over Haze, one which I was not expecting"
4422,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.68,"Assassin 2020 Split with jrc1093, who I owe my soul to for such a generous act. Thank you beyond words for sharing this with me.  2020 Vintage (green wax) - poured into a stemless glass at about 50°F. Wax was somewhat of a project, but it wasn't me opening it, and I'm prreettty sure I could have done it quicker. Just sayin'. Pours an oily jet black with absolutely zero light penetration - even on the pour. Two fingers of very dark brown head build up - coarse, with each individual bubble visible, and with very impressive retention. Clings to the glass. Visible effervescence can be seen feeding the collar, which is nuts.  Nose: Balanced roast that somehow conveys more caramel, toffee, and brown sugar than chocolate sets the foundation, with zero ash or char. There's some very restrained dark fruit - mostly dried cherry, and it's quite tucked in. There's a hint of vanilla frosting, as well as some raw brownie batter. Tons of oak and bourbon quickly become the star of the show, with warm, saturated bourbon, lending classic caramel, brown sugar, and barrel spice notes. The oak is splintery, woody, and prominent - like sticking your head in a fresh barrel. A round nuttiness encompasses everything. Ethanol becomes very apparent as it opens up, but integrates well. A really stunning aroma. Palate: Assassin opens up with an explosion of chocolate cake batter, hot chocolate, splintery bourbon-soaked oak, soft caramel, English toffee, and brown sugar. Very sweet, rich, and decadent, but never becoming cloying or saccharine, as the barrel constantly grounds it. The malts here still shy away from acrid or charry roast, contributing very little coffee, dark chocolate, or bitterness, and instead, milky, creamy, sweet chocolate, and a whisper of Cavendish pipe tobacco. There is an underlying note of vanilla frosting, and malted milk balls, framed by a constant round nutty element, like praline pecans and hazelnut butter. The chocolatey sweetness begins to subside, as a full-on punch of splintery, dry, toasted oak lends a nice woodiness, with dusty, mature bourbon sweeping in to provide a drying balance. The finish lingers with oak, caramel, toffee, and tobacco, rather than roast or ash. Surprisingly easy to drink. Mouthfeel/Body: Everything you've heard about Toppling Goliath stouts applies here. It's almost hard to believe. As soon as Assassin passes your lips, it fills your mouth with rich, oily, slick, viscous liquid, reminiscent of motor oil, but with an added fluffy softness from the fine effervescence. Chewy, decadent, and luscious, yet never actually sticky, fudgey, or overbearing - with that splintery oak perfectly drying it out and letting it lift off the palate with no lingering sweetness. Definitely coats the lips though. Warming, but never hot or burning, and somehow, is actually easy to drink. Overall: I'm not one to cave into hype, and I'll admit when something is overrated. Assassin delivers almost everything you could possibly want from an un-adjuncted barrel-aged imperial stout. Densely saturated with sweet, decadent milk chocolate, caramel, and vanilla, with a bold bourbon presence, heavy oak for balance, sweet, nutty malts, and a texture that is almost hard to believe, all while keeping balanced, drinkable, and still very much an imperial stout. No beer is worth hundreds of dollars, but value aside, it's difficult not to fall in love with this one. I'm grateful for the experience."
4423,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.0,"Side Project continues to make desirable and drinkable stuff! This one is no exception and drinks wonderfully, yet it is not the ""best of the best."" I fear that hype gives it the 100 point score. It is excellent and very worthy of high scores - just not that high."
4424,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.68,"Had this on tap at Henry's Taproom in Saratoga, ny on 2/21/20. As soon as I saw this on the chalkboard there was no other choice. This brewery carries the weight of Ages of brewing quality. Not my first draught of this however, already being in Burlington numerous times. That being said, this is an amazingly subtle NEIPA with so much complexity that you could write an essay on this elixir if you didn't devolve into a blabbering idiot after 3 or 4 of this. My friend met me for 1 beer and it turned into 3 each! THIS IS A MUST-HAVE BEER! The experience of drinking this will make you wax poetic about the ingrained vermont qualities of superior IPA's. Do find this and do enjoy it but please....give your keys to the bartender and Uber home."
4425,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,5.0,"12 oz can, born on 12/23/20, poured into a CBC pint glass at 42 degrees F:"
4426,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.75,Can dated 3/20/17. This is the third can consumed and a revisit on 6/23/17! Whoa this got better with over 3 months of age on it. From the pop of the can fruit juices hit the nose! Slight sediment when poured and a noce white head leaving spotted lacing. The taste is straight hop juice and 0 bitterness. The feel is full with a slight alcohol burn in the back but that's expected for a 10% abv. Overall it was awesome and my last can so hopefully they do this again.
4427,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.37,"Poured from the bottle into a teku glass. B #510 February 5th 2018. Fleeting and sudsy tan head, that dissolves pretty quickly, to barely a thin collar. Interesting body color though. Opaque and dark but has this giant amount of purple to it somehow. This is an interesting aroma. Wine like fruit flavors mixing in with an interesting cocoa bent. Rich dusting cocoa powder, almost husky and carob thick ripping on the nose. Not sweet at all, but not much barrrel hinting character on this. Impressive but not sure the angle this is going. So down the hatch and what do we get? Big richness. Light bodied but with excellent silky quality and maybe a touch of cutting fizz, filling with rich flavors. Light warm touches of raspberry and cherry like kirsch heat, mixing with a dark decadent cocoa powder that blankets and even neutralizes the sweetness so perfectly. Rich dusting finish on the aftertaste, while large, doesn't come off as a hot boozy mess. I am literally feeling fine powder on my lips and tongue with this brew. Impressive and punchy. Goes aggressive but with some control, but not without some sacrifices. Impressive stuff."
4428,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.34,"12oz bottle. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It smelled of coconut, roasted coffee and caramel. Strong coconut flavor with a mild coffee, chocolate and caramel finish."
4429,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.84,"2021 bottle poured cellar temp to a coffee mug. Hey, that was the right move because this is a great cup of coffee. No head, but some islands swirling around. Nose is amazing roasty coffee and charred oak barrel. First sips are wonderful gustatory representation of the olfactory sensation. Coffee flavor is dense, heavy, dirty in a good way. The bourbon barrel adds a nice cut to the coffee, along with a bit of vanilla sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and full, perfect for the way this tastes. Alcohol has a little bite, but it’s still very crushable for a big beer. I had to drive 3 hours each way to get some Jackie O’s BA beers, but it was well worth the effort."
4430,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.0,"2015 vintage; drank 8/12/16 @ the Yarchives.  Brown/black appearance.  Minimal dark tan head; minimal lace.  Vanilla, milk chocolate, coconut & oak notes in the nose.  Medium thick mouthfeel.  Coconut, oak & milk chocolate flavors up front; vanilla notes on the finish. No booze heat.  Sweet but not cloying; an enjoyable dessert treat."
4431,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.58,**
4432,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.5,"Just a classic top end New England IPA. Hazy grapefruit color, juicy as hell with both citrus and a variety of fruit flavors. So juicy, I was thinking there was fruit pulp in the glass."
4433,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.47,Not always the biggest fan of triples but this is so good . Smell is little hop burn and booze but it is balanced out by the taste some dank notes and good bitterns malt stays I the background
4434,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.82,Pour a nice smooth dark color smells of huge maple drinks a little thin but great flavor bacon kicks in on the finish great beer 2nd year for me awesome
4435,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.27,"Another big thanks to rudzud. Pretty Much no head, well light bubbles, little lacing, very hazy candy orange color. Nose big stone fruit, peach apricot like, big apricot, little tart but nice juicy fruit, little tangy acidic. Taste brings more tangy fruit, big apricot this time, stone fruit all over, with fair acidity, little tangy, light salty, savory especially, juicy tart fruit, faint candy fruit. Finish fair bitterness mango skin like, tart acidity, and plenty of apricot stone fruit. Mouth is med bod lighter carb. Overall ok, pretty nice characters, not phenomenal but def enjoyable."
4436,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.45,This lives up to it's reputation ... Nose hits you square in the face .. nice lacing ... Hidden ABV... full bodied and yummy taste ... Bravo to this C Bus brewer
4437,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,5.0,This is my only perfect score.
4438,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.45,"Incredibly sweet, a straight up dessert beer for sure. It had delicious, intense coconut dominating the overall flavor profile. Mouthfeel was excellent, no complains at all. Only good in small quantities though, due to the cloying sweetness."
4439,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.38,"Surprisingly one of the better triple ipas out there. Not overly bitter and weedy/dank.  Some nice tropical and citrus/juice notes. Very big ipa. Pretty juicy. For the style, this is solid."
4440,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.63,Can courtesy of yllib. 
4441,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.34,"Had this alongside an O'so Arbre Qui Donne (which, just as personal preference, I liked slightly better). Hazy orange-yellow color with very little head. Aroma was very funky, with the apricot complementing nicely. The taste was tart and crisp, with the best way I can describe it as 'funky fresh.' The apricots were there, but the funky and tart, slightly puckering mouthfeel that finished not as dry as expected are what make the beer special."
4442,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.29,"Moderately hazy golden orange body. Not a particularly long lasting or fluffy head despite the robust effervescence. Huge aromatics -- akin to Cantillon Fou Foune -- of overripe peach, apricot, fruit leather, tropical fruits, acidic lacto character, some barrel. Flavors are hugely tart, perhaps a bit heavy-handed, with a crisp and refreshing body. Definitely a sharing beer, I split a 750ml between 7 people and felt that I had just enough and any more would have been overwhelming. A solid wild for sure, but lacking the subtle funky complexity of, say, a good Belgian lambic or a Hill Farmstead barrel aged mixed fermentation ale.  86/100"
4443,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.47,"Poured into a teku glass via can dated 4/10/2019 color is a cola brown with light tan foam smell is Maple, baker's chocolate and coffee taste is a nice amount of Maple up front mixed in with some milk chocolate, vanilla and bitter coffee to round it out medium carbonation mouthfeel is pretty thick and creamy for a milk stout after HOTS this is my favorite of the TH milk stouts I've had"
4444,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.7,"I just had the 2017 Black Note Stout and it was great. It's hard to get where I live so I was happy to finally get my hands on it. What a wonderful stout, full bodied and flavorful and yet smooth and easy drinking. It is truly delicious. Look: dark brown / black with a half inch creamy mocca colored head Aroma: chocolate and some bourbon. Taste: Roasted malts, chocolate, moderate bourbon to round it off. Body/Overall: full body, creamy, silky, smooth"
4445,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.5,"Pours a medium golden color, very hazy. Ample foamy white head. Dank hoppy aroma, guava and mango. Balanced hop flavor, dank with gentle bitterness that fades. Citrusy with mango and tropical fruit flavors. Creamy texture, fairly thick and viscous. Overall a fantastic DIPA. 4/27/21"
4446,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.49,"Picked it up on pearl street in Boulder..The thing has about as black and pours like 10-30w. The smell is nice and boozy - alcohol and whisky. The taste goes where you expect, to the malty, roast, hoppy, bourbon booze place. It works. You can tell it's huge - nothing is hidden. An excellent bourbon barrel stout . .."
4447,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.44,"Wow, this is a fantastic beer! Thanks to my wonderful wife for putting this in our anniversary mixed 6 pack. Dark as the deepest corner of the universe, a head that could support the lunar lander, lacing like a Calder, and then you get to smell it, and ultimately put it in your mouth. Bourbon, coffee, chocolate, but not too much of any of the main characters. Beyond the tastes in the foreground are little subtleties rounding out the cast. Fantastic."
4448,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.89,Thick Diabetes in a bottle. The Coconut and vanilla come through perfectly. It almost like drinking your favorite cake. One of the best overall beers Ive had.
4449,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,4.49,"16oz can served in a chalice. Dated 04/29/20. Look- Dark opaque coffee/almost black color, solid brown head that quickly recedes to a light ring of foam, light spotty lacing. No carbonation streaming after it settles.  Smell- The aroma is killer. Fresh ground coffee, maple syrup and chocolate, dark bready malt, burnt sugar/caramel, dark fruits (raisins and figs), vanilla and slight licorice.  Taste- Rich roasted bready malt, sweet chocolate and maple syrup, coffee, burnt sugar/caramel and vanilla. Light coffee like bitterness that doesn't linger on the finish.  Feel- Medium bodied with a smooth, creamy texture. Really well balanced. Very light carbonation on the tongue.  O- Completely sublime and delicious, probably better served on a cold fall day than in the middle of June, but it's doing the job just fine."
4450,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.77,"Appearance: Opaque golden orange in color, with a tall dense cloudy white head. Lovely lacing on the glass after a few sips.  Aroma: Ripe ripe ripe orange, hops, lemon.  Flavor: Fruity ripe orange surprise basically... Ripe orange, cream, fresh hops, greeeen grass. It has so much flavor popping out of it for a 6.8% IPA.  Palate/Finish: Creamy, carbonation, very very smooth and fluffy. Finishes with ripe bitter orange.  Overall: Damn I wish this was in grocery stores! At the same time I guess I don't... it's extremely well-made, but more-so it's a signature of true craft. Great job Tree House."
4451,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.31,"375 bottle shared by Dan (@1up), thanks! Not much head. Sweet flavor, but not a thick mouthfeel. Not a ton of barrel either. Good but not world class."
4452,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.51,"Pours a thick, oily black with low, chocolate colored foam. Smell is sweet and rich with notes of chocolate, molasses, coffee, cinnamon and some bourbon and rye. Taste is boozy and powerful with huge notes of coffee, chocolate, golden syrup and bourbon, backed by minor notes of cinnamon, muscovado sugar and some sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy and well carbonated. Overall, a monster of a stout, huge in every way."
4453,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.77,"2018 Bottle (Orange Wax) A really fantastic, in-your-face whiskey barrel stout. Lots of stewed fruits cut through a whiskey potency that finishes dangerously smooth. Very impressed. Had heard some possible bottle variance, but this one was holding up exceptionally well."
4454,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.48,"Essentially no head production on the pour, although there is the slightest amount of build up - perhaps 1/16"" at best - as the carbonation rises to the surface. Deep, purplish-brown body. Incredibly boozy on the nose; tons of liquor, in particular bourbon and apple brandy, but also a port/sherry-like mild oxidation. Loads of dark fruit, nearly juicy in their expression, including dates and prunes, along with raisins and red grapes. Waves of brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, molasses, and licorice. Incredibly potent on the palate, a melange of dark fruit, bread, bourbon, oak, molasses, smoke, and oxidation. Without question a sipping beer; not something you can really dig into quickly. It doesn't just reward patience; it demands it. Thick and syrupy. Undeniably boozy, but not hot or painful. Very little carbonation."
4455,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.49,"16oz can dated 6/17/17. Pours cloudy gold with a short-lived head and minimal retention. Aromatics are hugely tropical and dank. Pineapple, mango, candied grapefruit, white grapes, and weed. Medium bodied with a tacky, soft, resinous mouthfeel. Ripe tropical fruit abounds on the palate. Lush with mango, peach, pineapple, and pine. Hints of blossom honey and a mild warmth hint at the heft of the brew. Subdued malt and fairly dry for the style. Finishes with a slight sweetness and a sustaining tropical note. Great beer, a bonanza of tropical citrus."
4456,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.72,"12 oz bottle, born on 3/6/20, poured into a snifter:"
4457,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.44,"2017 bottle courtesy of @FlintB back in NBS BIF #007. Side by side with a 2013 bottle of the basic Expedition. Pour is immediately evident that there's some differences. Dark brown head gathers and sits in a cloudbank across the middle (compared to a pale desaturated brown for the basic). A gentle swirl brings all the fuzzy mocha brown head back to coat the top. Thick obsidian body absorbs all light coming it's direction.  Nose is more mellow than I'd expected. Some light spice and faint cocoa, and a fair amount of molasses and some roast. Doesn't smell like alcohol per se, but as I withdraw I can feel the evaporating ether withering in my nostril. Taste is smoothe chocolate and coffee and toffee and some wood and is just really rich and delicious.  Holy shit this may be the smoothest most velvety perfectly soft and viscous drink I've ever imbibed. And while it doesn't taste low-ABV by any means, the 12.8 is dangerously easy to forget about. This may be the best mouthfeel I've ever encountered in a beer.  Man, thanks Brian for sending this my direction. I will now be forever on the lookout for this in addition to the basic Expedition from these guys."
4458,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.49,"Bottled 10/30/13. Nice dark pour, not too viscous but nearly black in color. Not too much head or lacing, but the color and appearance looks great. Predominantly dark fruit and chocolate on the nose. Very, very mild oxidation, but that’s just me being picky. Hints of dark, roasty coffee on the back end. Damn, this has held up incredibly well. Boozy, charred oak, bourbon flavors make way for a perfectly balanced base of roasty coffee with hints of dark fruit and chocolate flavors.  Smooth mouthfeel, warming and boozy but a good weight to it. Bourbon and roast linger."
4459,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.86,"Pours a rich golden color with a bright effervescent head that recedes quickly. Smell is lemon, citrus, stone fruit, funk, yogurt. Taste is essentially like a light white sparkling wine with tart yogurt intermixed. Lots of white grape, peach, apple, pear with a creamy yogurty sourness. Really tastes like a fruit on the bottom yogurt cup. The mouthful is rich and creamy while the carbonation keeps it light. Outstanding beer. My biggest issue with Fuzzy is that the subtle sweetness of the white peaches were drowned out by the intense yogurty sourness. Blueberry Flanders had a nice balanced refreshing tartness but the blueberry flavor was a bit disappointing. This is a much better balance for my taste than both, a best of both worlds. Probably my favorite SP so far. Get it today!"
4460,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.36,"BISSELL BROTHERS SWISH DIPA 4/23/19 Canned 3/7/19. A month and a half old. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House stemmed tulip. a; Opaque gold with a finger thick white head which receded to thin head and spotty lacing. s: Intense citrus/pine resin. t; Follows the nose with some dankness, moderate hop bitterness and curiously strong initial throat burn for an 8% ABV brew. Later grapefruit notes become prominent. m; Medium, good body and carbonation tingle. o; A powerful-tasting DIPA which nonetheless remains light enough to be fairly easy drinking."
4461,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.6,"2019 release given to me by my West Coast daughter as a Christmas present with orders not to wait too long to crack it open. Poured into a DFH tulip from a pint and 6 ounce bottle. Inky dark brown body with a hefty dark tan head. Head eventually fades to nothing but this is a sipper to savor so time constraints are lblown away. Smell is of coconut with lots of dark boozy malty fruits. Taste is just a carnival of competing flavors all of which are pleasant. Alcohol, while obviously present, is well balanced and not overpowering. Mouthfeel is fine for a strong ale like this. I'm definitely a fan and then some."
4462,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.81,"Very pretty pour: thick, black, and fizzy, with a retentive chocolate brown head. Smells like chocolate vanilla cake, but somehow without any ersatz or cloying nodes. Lots of brewers have recently resorted to gimmickery to make their beers taste like pastries--pouring frosting and moon pies into the mash, etc. This is old fashioned coffee stout sweetness, and it's done to a motherfucking t. Tastes very nearly as good as it smells. Chocolate and vanilla up front, moving into more of a traditional dry coffee stout in the middle with bittersour barley balancing out the sweeter flavors, and the finish is a wonderful combination of mocha, vanilla, and barley.  Overall this is a world-class beer that's absolutely worth seeking it. If the body were just a wee bit thicker I would have considered it perfect. But that's just me. A score of 5 for Double Shot is fully warranted."
4463,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,3.87,Nose is grassy/sweet with a hint or orange. Not a punch in the face of hops or fruit. Taste is very smooth. More citrus fruit with a slight bitter hop finish.
4464,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,3.52,"Shared bottle, RBNAG 2011. Barrel aged 6 months, with currants added. Reddish brown colour. Intense farmhouse aroma, sour fruit, oak and spices. Sour flavour, good but not impressive."
4465,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.75,2016 version poured from a 22oz. bottle. Yet another FW beer I love. The coffee is not strong which I prefer. The barrel provides just the right amount of sweetness. Medium low carbonation. Thick.
4466,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.4,"On a sad note, this is my last Treehouse brew left in the fridge. I nursed this bomber all by myself. From the bottle, it pours a viscous and motor oil looking dark liquid. The color is nearly pitch black. Surprisingly, a finger length tan mocha head belatedly billows up to the surface. It shows decent retention and rings of lacing. As the name would suggest the nose is dominated by notes of coffee and espresso. In addition, there are notes of dark chocolate, toasted and nutty malts, caramel, brown sugar and dark fruit. The hops aromas have a subtle earthy and woodsy quality to them. Full bodied with a smooth and mouth coating viscous feel. The carbonation is gentle and mellow. The flavors are rich and complex yet not too cloyingly sweet or boozy. Decadent flavors of milk chocolate fudge, caramel and brown sugar are balanced by bittersweet notes of dark chocolate and roasted malts. There are jammy flavors of dark fruit and bright notes of cherry. Surprisingly, the coffee flavor is not as prominent as in the aroma, although it is felt more in the finish. The bitterness is relatively tame as it is provided by gentle notes of woodsy hops and light notes of espresso. The finish is long and creamy with moderately toasty notes.  This is a nice dessert beer that really hit the spot. I would have liked a bit more coffee flavor, however, my sense of taste might have been a little off tonight. It’s also very drinkable despite the ABV."
4467,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.31,"CANNED ON 10/25/19 Hazy Arnold Palmer with 2-finger off-white foamy head with solid lacing.  Big pineapple and guava aroma, lighter orange and lime Delicious flavorful but highly drinkable with pineapple, grapefruit, and guava with light orange and lime flavors. Mild bitterness with floral esters.  Soft feel with a fairly crisp, dry feel.  A stellar APA - one of the best I've had in years. Seek it out."
4468,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.37,"A: Med gold with a touch of pastel that lightens it to maybe a dull yolk color. Evenly distributed 1F of white head with 2-3 min of retention before fading into faint wisps. S: Didn't brighten up the room on first crack of the can, but bringing in the nose to take a sip...yeah, it's definitely a brash, citra forward aroma. Sweet citrus, Buddha's Hand, sweet and earthy lychee, custard apple, mango, floral orange blossom honey.  M: It's soft and med body, but not Dream thick. A superfine carbonation keeps it smooth--not crisp--and keeps it fairly drinkable for the ABV.  T: Starts with copious amount of melon and mango lassi accompanied by a fruity caramel leading into pineapple jolly ranchers; fresh cut grass x key lime pie jelly beans. Sweetness subsides a bit for some dry tangerine San Pellegrino and ruby grapefruit GuS drinks to set in, which are both pithy while carrying a semblance or sweetness. Finishes with a floral bitterness accompanied by notes of black cherry. O: In a crowded market of citra IPAs this one indeed stands out. Fruitier and sweeter on the nose than on the palate, it does help the bitterness slide down. Only once did I get a minimal medicinal, Vitamin C tablet-type vibe."
4469,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.17,"16oz. can into Night Shift stemware. Shared with schen9303.  Nose is citrus, honey and cane sugar. Almost zesty. Solid if simple and a touch muted. Beer opens accented clementine and orange. Starfruit, cane sugar and some pineapple in the middle and end. Simple but delicious. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Prickly on the palate and bright and accented going down. Clean aftertaste. Super drinkable. I don't know if this beer is perfect but it's certainly very well made. Awsome representation of the style."
4470,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.44,"16 oz can poured into a snifter. Pours an opaque, oily black. Aroma and flavor are bitter coffee, dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, and sweet vanilla. Very drinkable despite how sweet and thick it comes across."
4471,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,3.5,"750 ml corked and capped bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5%. Made with 300 g of raspberries per liter beer. Clear signal red colour, moderate pink head. Intense aroma of raspberries (no surprise). The flavour is very sour with notes of lemons and raspberries, fairly dry and crisp."
4472,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.32,"Sweet pineapple, bready/biscuity, and tropical hoppy nose on this one! Taste follows with a soft and juicy, slightly malty, tropical hoppy bitter finish. This has really nice depth and mouthfeel for a single! This is good!"
4473,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.58,"L: Crystal clear light Amber with a thin head, very little retention, and no lacing. S: Light aroma, notes of white wine, oak, peach, pear and subtle biscuit malt. T: Intense, tart, and juicy notes of grape, peach, pear, and grapeskin. Subtle oak and bisciut malt as well as some funk. F: Medium light body, gentle carb, dry finish. Overall: A delicious farmhouse ale, very complex fruity flavors balanced against Earthy, oaky funk. Highly recommend."
4474,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.41,"2018 bomber, and I'm very excited to be able to try this one. Pours black and moderately thick but not syrupy, with very little head that eventually burbles up from below. The nose is a bit subdued, with cacao nibs, vanilla, red wine tannins, and malt balls, plus a tiny hint of black cherry and plum on occasion. Big bourbon notes on the tongue that amplify the aromas and provide some spice. Punching above its weight class at 10% abv. A nice, moderately full mouthfeel and boozy finish.  I will definitely try to get another bottle of this to put away and age. I love it."
4475,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.26,"2009 bottle thanks to BuckeyeBoy. Still, flat black pour.Aroma is cherries, chocolate. Taste offers brown sugar notes, raisins. Sticky and sweet. And still good after 11 years."
4476,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.23,"Not quite as tart as expected. Bottle says 6.2 ABV so perhaps the recipie changed. Definite oakiness, well defined raspberry with the mustiness of red wine. Not really the sour I’m looking for unfortunately."
4477,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.67,Look - Fantastic slight whittish yellow thick color with a nice white head and sticky lacing
4478,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.41,"Semi-clear mahogany to prune juice dark brown with faint purple hues and a short fuzzy tan head that quickly dies to a used motor oil looking surface. There might be some tiny chunks of barrel char towards the bottom of the pour, but they are minimal. Viscous, almost syrupy, yet silky smooth, Anabasis b3 kicks off with dark fruit and Reisen before a sudden, surprisingly woody barrel presence. It's a little splintery at first, and quite mature, before developing some notes of decadence with time, such as nutty nougat, maple, and hints of caramel apple. Quite delicious, but maybe a little too woody, so I have a few other preferred favorites in this category. Frankly, I'm still surprised by the lofty pedestals that barleywines like this are placed while breweries like Cigar City just casually put out bangers on the regular that are AT LEAST just as good. --- Sharing a b5 bottle with friends mid-May 2021, I'm finding it to be surprisingly chocolatey. While there's a ton of bourbon barrel on back end, it's simultaneously less woody overall, allowing room for the darker malts to really edge this ever closer to stout territory. The charred oak adds classic nougat impressions, but also some unexpected marzipan qualities. It's overall less astringent and hoppy than I remember b3, and as such, I'm enjoying it even more, even if it is drifting further away from American, or even English #life. As such, I'm hesitant to alter my already fairly high score."
4479,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.5,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Perennial stemmed wine glass. Thanks Brian for sharing this long-time want.  On the nose I get a lot of vanilla, chocolate, fresh coffee beans, and surprisingly a bit of maple. Smells like an awesome breakfast stout.  Bold, dark chocolate notes, chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla-maple coffee, cocoa and bourbon on the follow through. The aftertaste is charred with dark roast coffee flavors lingering for a while. Mouthfeel is good with a medium-heavy body and low carbonation.  Sump is one of my favorite coffee stouts, so it was to be expected that I’d really enjoy BA sump, which I did. World-class beer!"
4480,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.65,"Canned on 05/06/19 and picked up at the Fort Point/Seaport brewery. Nose and flavor are inviting and delicious, with lots of those Mosaic qualities. Pine, pungent citrus fruit like mango, and fresh spring grassy goodness. Soooo smooth and creamy in the finish and feel. One of the finest examples of a properly-hopped APA with everything you look for in the style and in a craft beer in general. One of those beers you could drink every day without complaints."
4481,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.84,"Serving: 16 oz. can poured into a Goose Island pint glass. Canned on 11/27/19 (""I TAKE MY ESPRESSO VERY VERY SERIOUSLY"" edition), making this just over 3 months old at this point. A: Really hard not to mistake this for a BA beer. Pitch black, gorgeous mocha head. Decent amount of lacing up the glass. Literally almost pours out like motor oil, and I mean it. S: Nice fresh coffee up front, little bit of cocoa and vanilla too.  T: Way sweeter than I was expecting, but I'm okay with that. Coffee is not a huge player here, but mixes nice with heavy fudge, chocolate, coconut and molasses flavors.  M: Here's where it's hit out of the park. This may be the best mouthfeel I've had on any stout, let alone beer. It is so unbelievably chewy and rich. The flavors just linger for days. Truly, truly special. O: My introduction to dark beers by Tree House, and I am not disappointed. Holy smokes. The mouthfeel on this is world class. It's not a coffee-forward coffee beer, and that's okay. It just shows how complex it is with all the other flavors going on. BA tells me this is the #1 non-BA regular stout in the world. And while that's not a huge and coveted style, I don't see anything near it in this class. Beautifully done. Recommendation: Yes."
4482,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.73,"Big upgrade over original Dorothy in my opinion. The wine barrel add so much complexity, and this was perfectly carbonated as well. Not a lot of bells and whistles with adjuncts and or fruit being added, just a beautiful barrel-aged Saison."
4483,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.65,"Hazy light amber in the glass with an off-white head that leaves good lacing. Smells dank and resinous with candied pineapple and orange zest. Taste follows and is more citrus forward. Juicy, crisp, and clean. Was fantastic on a hot day like today. Great offering from Tree House. Glad I have more of this in the fridge."
4484,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.6,"500mL June 2017 bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead balloon glass. Thanks Ryan for sharing this with me. Pours a deep brown body, once it’s in the glass it’s opaque and black, thick. Small brown head reduces fairly quickly.  Aromas are sweet and fudgy, cocoa and dark fruit, biscotti, vanilla, and subtle maple. On the tongue it’s quite sweet but not cloying or “pastry”-like, more malty that sugary with rich chocolate fudge, vanilla-maple liquor, bourbon, dark fruits, molasses and roasty coffee on the follow through. Maple shows up as it warms up. The finish is roasty as well, bittersweet chocolate / charred malt sticks on the tongue for a bit. Mouthfeel is rich and thick with low carbonation. Definitely a sipper.  A fantastically crafted beer. More complex than similar stouts. The barrel works wonders here."
4485,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.86,"Pours amazingly turbid and hazy, looks like it is glowing! Yellow/orange in color, huge foamy head lasts a long time, fading slowly. Sweet hops citrus aroma, I get lemon, orange, grapefruit, light pine. Amazing hop flavor, mixes dankness and citrusy hop flavors with a touch of pine perfectly. Has a great citrus hop punch with a delicate touch of bitterness that allows wave after wave of hop flavor. Excellent carbonation. Overall an amazing IPA, definitely in my top 5 IPA’s. 4/16/21"
4486,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.41,"Huge thanks to Steve for this one. This has been on my radar for quite some time.  750ml bottle (vintage??) Poured into a classic tulip. Refrigerated for 5 days - allowed to warm up for 10 minutes.  Pours a brilliant honey straw golden colour, topped with a quick-to-dissipate finger of off white head. Excellent unfiltered clarity, and plenty of visible effervescence rising up to creating a sparkling top. Minimal lacing after swirling.  Nose: Rustic saison grains, likely a good amount of wheat. Crackery. Plenty of classic saison yeast aromas of wet hay, peppery spice, green apple, a faint hint of bubblegum, a whisper of clove, some woody spices, fresh cut grass, wet wool, petrichor, some delicate farmy funk, a hint of leather, and a wonderfully restrained acidity lending a big shroud of lemon. A beautiful saison aroma.  Palate: Bernice greets the palate with what is likely the most balanced acidity I've ever encountered. This is not a ""Midwest saison"" that makes you pucker up from top to bottom. A gentle tartness akin to unripe berries starts things off, while this delicate grainy sweetness follows. Beneath this sweet-tart balance are notes of lemon, apple, Bartlett pear, fresh grass, white grape, unripe berry, starfruit, fresh nectarine, white plum, a hint of phenolic black peppercorn, and dried orange peel. There is quite a bit of dusty brett, lending some light funk, wet wood, a gentle earthiness, fermenting stone fruit, and a gentle peach pit bitterness. There are subtle grassy floral notes from some very restrained hopping, which is greatly appreciated. The finish puts particular emphasis on these grassy floral notes, along with some dusty brett funk, and a gentle black pepper bite. The ale finishes beautifully dry, with zero lingering tartness, and a gentle, clean aftertaste of cracker saison grains, with the faintest whisper of tannic fruit pits.  Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-light bodied. Crisp, refreshing, and ultra snappy with the malt providing just enough body to provide a subtle softness. Effervescence is lively and fine, without being scratchy or seltzery. Gentle acidity upfront providing a balanced tartness, concluding with just the perfect degree of tannic dryness. Highly attenuated.  Overall: This is maybe the perfect all-around saison. It is absolutely authentic and beautifully classic in nature, with the most balanced amount of acidity you could possibly get in an ale like this. Not puckering, but enough to just nudge this into sour ale territory. This is everything you could ask for in a saison. Authenticity, perfect grain balance, gentle tartness, excellent yeast complexity, Belgian influence, crisp, refreshing body... It's wonderful. You won't find the complexity of the heavy hitter sours in this, but if it's the perfect saison you're looking for, Bernice will take you there. Privileged to be able to drink this."
4487,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.35,"Great Berliner, see little wrong with this one except it there is not much beer. It is a little tart but fruit takes over everything which for some people is a great thing. I wish there was a little bit more beer then a mango smoothy. Still crazy nose and great flavor though."
4488,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,1.75,The worst tasting beer I have ever had. A mix between cheap whisky and vomit. 6 hours after drinking one I can still taste it. The absolute worst tasting anything I've ever had. This is trash
4489,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.15,"2017 vintage (blend 5). A: Pours a very light straw color with a thin ring of very fine, bright white head. Nicely effervescent. Good retention for the minimal head that’s there. Decent good clarity. S: Hay, honey, apricot, light barnyard funk. Delicate. T: A bracing rush of moderate apricot, honey, grainy wheat, grass, and light mineraliness which imparts an interesting dimension. The moderate tartness fades fairly quickly on the finish which saves this from being too sour and helps quaffability.  M: Medium body and medium-high carbonation. Very mild creaminess.  O: Tasty, refreshing sour beer without a lot of complexity or depth. It’s hard to say that additional time would help: presumably, any additional development of the brett would be offset by fading of the fruit."
4490,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,3.58,"16 oz. can. Hazy orange. Smells of tropical fruit, acid fruit, booze. Tastes the same. Tropical fruit, light passion fruit, some chewy pine, which is surprising. Medium body. Good, but tastes like every other hazy IPA."
4491,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,3.85,"L: Very frothy. Amber. Clear. S: You can smell it from across the room.  T: Big hop flavor that doesn't pull any punches. Swiming in hops, may take your palate a moment to adjust. It makes Lake Erie Monster look like Lake Erie Gecko. This beer will slap your ass and call you Sally. F: It's heavy whatever it is. My favorite part is how resiny it is. O: Sometimes one will have a craving for super hoppy IPA, and Hop Juju will satisfy. The only problem is the availability sucks. In my store, I promote Fatheads like I do Great Lakes, and I have for years, and I'm lucky if I get two cases a year."
4492,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.88,"Look: dark, almost black ,small tan head with good lacing "
4493,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.25,Good stout - a little bitter for my liking but still very decent. I thought the taste was very decent but the after was not phenominal. Definitelty solid and good.
4494,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.25,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/24/17 with ""HOW ABOUT NO"" written below that. It's easy to see how this would be Trillium's flagship offering as this was quite heavy, dank, and tasty at the same time, while being a good example of what an American Pale Ale should be. Even though this can was two years old, it aged well and had very little sediment in it, as the flavors held up quite well over time! This had a nice pour to it as the liquid was a quietly radiant apricot with a fair head topping it off. A thin ring of lacing was left around the top of my pint glass as the faint collar was the best residue that I could find. A few soapy sections remained as I worked my way through this but it was disappointing for something that was quite enjoyable. Lots of bright stone fruit, peach, wheat, and white grape could be found in the varied nose as the taste had quite a range of flavors to it as well. Light wood, citrus pith, and a subtle earthiness could be found on the palate as this warmed up as I enjoyed the nuances of this beer. Moderately slick and lightly carbonated, this felt like Hawaiian Punch in the aftertaste as the tropical and juicy notes lingered on my tongue once the liquid fully went down... Not a lot of booze to this as this truly was an American Pale Ale and not an IPA that went by another name. Balanced in body, there was little sediment in the liquid or at the bottom of my pint glass once I finished this off. Certainly enjoyable, this wasn't a standout beer but had enough going for it that the hype wasn't entirely unjustified. Fans of Trillium would be wise to see this out although it's certainly not a hop bomb or full of dankness. Instead, this was a beer that anyone could easily embrace, since there was enough to like about it from the get-go!"
4495,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.35,"Was lucky enough to obtain this via a trade recently as this was one of the few popular offerings from Tree House that I had never reviewed on here before. Love the Haze and this was on par with it, although I thought it was a bit overrated. Needless to say, that's only because of the insanely high standards that this brewery has set as it wasn't because this was a letdown in any way, shape, or form! Of course, this had a dank golden hue to it with a nice head topping it off as it had the look of any typical juice bomb from New England. A little bit of dark sediment settled at the bottom but it wasn't noticeable as I swirled this as the liquid was nearly uniform in hue. Lovely lacing down the side of my pint glass as the rings were deep and well-defined along the top half of my pint glass, with thicker sections of rings below that. Lots of melon, honeydew, and tangerine juice in the nose as the taste was just as exotic and juicy on the palate. A bit of grapefruit tang and dank hops emerged as this fully warmed up as the malt was quite basic and recessed at the same time. Some hefty pine and tropical fruit rind emerged in the aftertaste but overall, this went down easily as everything melded well together. Hard to detect the alcohol here but it was present enough as I warmed up nicely once I finished this off. Canned on 12/19 with ""YES INDEED"" written above it, this was a solid beer but a bit too green, dank, and overripe for me to rate any higher on here. It's easy to see why this is so highly-regarded on here and any fan of Tree House would be wise to seek this out. I certainly wouldn't mind giving this another go-around!"
4496,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.22,"750ml bottle into tulip. Bottled 3/2/16. A: Pours a deep dark brown, near black, with raisin color highlights. A finger or two of ruddy brown head foamed up after the pour and quickly fizzed away into a faint bubbly collar. No lace."
4497,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.37,"Not a big sour person, but there beer was very enjoyable. Great hazy orange color and look. Flavor was smooth with more funk than sour for me. Could actually enjoy this very often. 2016 vintage"
4498,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.75,The regular Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze is rock solid. This is definitely a notch above when trying them side by side.  2012 375 ml bottle. Everything is heightened with this vs the regular Oude Geuze. Brighter smell and flavor. Awesome Geuze.
4499,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.42,"Shared by ygtbsm94 at the Sour & Wild Ale Tasting on April 14, 2012. Thanks a lot Brad. Served side by side with an unlabeled bottle of Cable Car Kriek, apparently more tart than the labeled / distributed version. Served in my Lost Abbey teku glass.  After the beer gushed everywhere, it appears a beautiful ruby hue with a soft, pink head. Bonus points for the pretty appearance, deductions for the carbonation issues so commonly associated with The Lost Abbey. Beautiful aroma. Tart cherries and distinctive Lost Abbey funk.  Not especially tart, but a delicate balance of sweet cherry and tart, funky wild ale. Again, very well done. Light on the palate. Moderate carbonation on the tongue. Overall, this was quite good. Aside from the gushing, I have no complaints. I'm grateful for the opportunity to try this rare delicacy, not to mention two versions side by side!"
4500,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.69,"2012 or 2013 vintage....12oz bottle  L: pours light brown color, syrup look with no head on the pour."
4501,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.55,"Got curbside service last week, Freekin’ Covid. Sucks being 100 feet away from tap room and not getting in! Oh well, got to be happy it’s even doing curbside. I just wanted to try this when I was looking at potential beers and am super happy I did. I really like sours and while this isn’t a sour the Juicy was, for me, close. But this didn’t overwhelm me with tart at all. Just a great blend and very easy going down. I know it’s not a sour but if it was it would be my favorite of all that I have had. Pours a light color, slight head, not much lacing, lingered nicely in my mouth and I could smell it just when I opened it before I poured it. Wonderful beer. Kind of wish I had purchased a couple more than just my two. Would have loved it in a 750 ml bottle though. Just not enough of it."
4502,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.66,"Pours mahogany with a 2 inch tan head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end. Hazy. Aroma is chocolate, herbal, caramel, toffee, dry fruits, cloves, estery. Taste is toffee, caramel, dark fruits, wheat, Belgian yeast, candy sugar. Full bodied, lively carbonation. Sweet finish. Wow! I just love these Belgian Trappist ales."
4503,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.6,Had on tap at Hollingshead Deli during latest Orange County CA “Beer Safari”. 
4504,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.6,"Good God. I'm not even a big sour drinker but every time I put Cascade in my face I'm filled with joy. Had this minutes before A Cantillon Kriek. No contest, this wins."
4505,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.5,"Complex and lovely. A top tier lambic. Try it if you get the opportunity. At a fair price, I would drink this as often as I could. Framboos and Hommage are a touch better, but this is in the conversation"
4506,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.34,2016 bottling.
4507,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.97,"A: Beer pours a very black body. Very little head or lacing, as common with Prairie stouts. Head color looked almost like a Cherry Coke. Very dark red colored head. Look was very typical for a Prairie stout.  S: Large amounts of rum at first pour. As the beer warmed some of the rum aromas gave way to some sweeter smells. Vanilla, chocolate, and coconut become more noticeable as the beer got closer to room temperature.  T: Very nice balance of rum flavors mixed with multiple layers of dessert like tastes. Similar to the nose, the beer is very heavy rum and molasses in the beginning before somewhat dissapearing to give way to sweeter flavors. Nice amount of vanilla and chocolate mixed with some coconut as the beer gets warmer.  M: Thick full mouthfeel. Many sweet dessert like beers become too cloying here but Prairie did this one right with the addition of rum. Very full flavored and warming. The ABV is obvious while drinking and afterwards but somewhat subdued due to the coconut and vanilla.  O: Remarkable beer. Only negative is the lack of head or lacing. One of the best beers I have had regardless of style. So many beers in this style go overboard with sweetness but not here. Nice balance of alcohol and sweetness."
4508,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,3.24,This is straight battery acid. Batch one and batch two are just straight acid. Batch one was even more so than batch two. This is easily the worst side project beer I've had to date. This will be a preference thing though. Both of my friends liked it while I poured the rest of mine in their glasses
4509,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,5.0,This was the first beer I ever had from Hill Farmstead and boy was in memorable. What a great first trip it was and getting to enjoy this made it the best!
4510,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.45,"A spectacular stout; as the previous reviewers explain the taste follows the nose - apples, malty, boozy."
4511,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.6,"Canned 8/5/20, purchased 8/22 and drunk the next day! A really delicious NE-IPA! Light orange and hazy, with nice tight foam that is retained at a low level for the whole time it takes to drink the beer. Lovely aroma when you crack the can. The taste is outstanding - lots of fruit, a little citrus, nice dankness and a lot of taste that sticks around. Balance is the name of the game here. The mouthfeel is super-smooth and creamy without being too thick or syrupy. Overall, a really nice beer - glad I found a mix-pack that had some Gggreennn!s in it."
4512,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.33,"Bright hazy yellow with 4 fingers of rocky white head. Smells of gravel, burnt rubber, Like Great Divides Nelson. Citrus and orange Julius as well. The taste follows the nose. Slightly sweet. Smooth, juicy body with light powdery carbonation. I got this in Waynesville NC, and am enjoying it today in Summerville, SC, June 27th 2020."
4513,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.16,"Purchased at local Meijer store for about $16 for a 4 pack. Pricey, but as of this writing, it is rated 100, while my fav Dragon's Milk is 91. Wish I could do this live, but here it unfolds as it happens. Taken from frig, very small pfftt as I pop the cap. Pours into glass...very dark color...head and legs like Marilyn Monroe...nice but getting old. Aroma a bit malty, but my sniffer pretty much got snuffed decades ago. Carbonation tingles the tongue, chocolate is there but not a Willy Wonka dream. One reviewer claims it improves as it warms, so I'll try to resist guzzling for now, but it's good stuff. Definitely smoother as it warms, and more bourbon and coffee flavors. Getting frothy as I swirl it in mouth. Given it's a ""breakfast Stout"", would probably be good with pancakes. Definitely better as it heats to room temperature ( or at 12% ABV, maybe it's me). Feed the cats (they love it when I sit on the floor). Beer warms some more. Chocolate seems more pronounced now. Only a few swigs left...will be sorry to see it go.  Overall: Definitely an experience. Great brew, although questionable if it beats my fav quaff. Certainly leaves you with a buzz. A once yearly indulgence ( on my budget). Worth doing again."
4514,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.57,"Beer #250 of the BA Top 250 - Completed after 6 years and 437 different beers apart of the Top 250 Thank you @Brewzma L: Jet black, light tan head S: Apple, vanilla, peppers, cinnamon, bit of brandy T: Lots of cinnamon and apple brandy, a bit of caramel. Nice pepper back note F: This is thick and viscous O: This beer is the culmination of chasing the dynamic Top 250 through its multiple iterations. It is a nice cap to a wonderful journey."
4515,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.78,Poured from a 22oz bomber into a speiglau BA glass.  Look is a dark dark cola with red highlights and absolutely no head.  Aroma is the most chocolaty vanilla beer I've ever smelled. Lots of deep deep bourbon in the nose.  Taste is more of that rich barrel and less of the chocolate. A perfect blend of intense barleywine and bourbon barrels.  Can't believe how good this is.
4516,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.75,#4. A lot of barrel presence. I agree with others that mentioned a port like presence with a welcomed dryness and soft/medium amount of sweetness. Phenomenal stuff
4517,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.43,"Cultured monk's cassock with ruby ​​reflections, compact ocher head with good resistance. On the nose molasses, cherries in alcohol, vanilla, coconut, maple syrup, wood and bourbon. On the palate the sweet notes of brown sugar and dark jam are partly balanced by a slight hops touch on herbaceous tones."
4518,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.25,Can from Fort Point.
4519,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.36,"Pours dark yellow. Smells of hops like a typical New England IPA. Solid beer, but reminds me a lot of some of the other IPAs I've already had. I think the addition of lupulin powder adds nuance to the typical hop profile."
4520,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.69,2016 Purple Wax Bottle
4521,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.21,"Can. From Zombier. In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 5. Really strong frutality and bitterness, with some milkshake ipa reminiscences. Good but didnt live up the hype, as it is nothing that more accessible breweries cant do nor surpass"
4522,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.87,"Turbid apricot hues. Finger tall head that recedes onto an ever present ring.  Huge sweet trioical fruits, subtle undertones of grass, pine resins, and bread. The balance between the hops is amazing. My my. Mango and sharp bittering pine. The bittering just cascades away. The flavors are even more balanced than they were on the nose.  No evidence of the ABV. Smooth and full with a juicy start and a crisp finish. Low carbonation.  Signature Trillium. Nuanced and bold. A contradiction. A new favorite."
4523,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.44,"The beer pours a some what hazy gold with a thin white head that recedes immediately. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of orange, mango, guava, and passion fruit. It tastes tart, tangy, with mango, orange pulp, guava, passion fruit, and strawberry. The feel is medium is light and dry. A good sour from J Wakefield."
4524,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.54,"75cl bottle drank at the brewery in Brussels. Poured into 25cl Cantillon glass pours a brillant dark pink color, foamy white head that fades. But lively carbonation. the Raspberry flavor is nice without the over sweetness of other brewery's Fruited Lambics, this has the nice pleasant refreshing tartness that drinks well. thin bodied."
4525,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.46,"On tap at Pelican Feb. 27th 2021 in a snifter. Looks wise, the beer is solid opaque black with a light tan head and a gorgeous, albeit thin, crown. The nose is incredible, roses, tulip, floral grass and clover, married with rich oats and barley malt. The taste is mollasses forward, sour caramelized apricot and plums, rich smoked cacao and cinnamon, raspberry tartness to sharpen it, roasted raisins and soda bread, ending on a long, very drawn out vanilla blackberry sweetness that lingers strongly against the palate in the back for up to 20 minutes. The mouthfeel is, obviously, luscious, rich, oily, and silky, while finishing a touch wet. Absolutley incredible beer. Truly magic flavors, buy on sight thank me later. Impeccable dessert choice!"
4526,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.9,"Aroma dominated by chocolate, tobacco, leather, port, sherry, and bourbon, with a little bit of a smoky, amaretto twist to it that adds some additional complexity. Taste is so smooth; bourbon forward and subdued sweetness, giving it a dark chocolate and port-like characteristic. What a beauty."
4527,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.09,"Sparkling vibrant gold with a large, airy off-white foam disappearing into a shimmering, lightly bubbling surface. Aroma is a mix of white wine and slightly spicy, funky aged cheese and hay with sharply sour notes of tangerine, white grape and toasty, drying white oak. There's a bit of bread far in the background. Taste is sharply sour with a complex woodiness. White wine, green grape and toasted seed flavors mingle well with each other. A nice oaky swallow adds an odd, toasty bitterness that may be contributing a touch of wild greens. An effervescent carbonation turns into an airy froth through a smooth, medium body with a tangy, semi-dry finish. 2017 vintage"
4528,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.24,"Appearance: Pours auburn brown with a modest head; decent retention Smell: Tart blackberry, with defined lactic tones; hints of grain in the back Taste: Lactic and acetic tartness from the outset, with the blackberry tones building; the tartness builds through the middle and finish but never overwhelms Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation; modest puckering Overall: A nice sour, though it lacks some complexity"
4529,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.49,"2019 batch. Picked up 6/20/20 at Zanottos Market on Naglee, SJ, Ca."
4530,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.64,"Pours a hazy yellow with a thick white head that dissipates slowly. On the nose, orange with hints of grassy floral hop aroma. Taste follows aroma with orange and grassy hops on the front followed by some bitterness on the back. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Very smooth and easy drinking. Overall a fantastic NEIPA from Louisiana!"
4531,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.28,"Very nice APA. Slightly pinkish in color and very fruity, with melon and passionfruit standing out on the nose and palate. Nice soft texture. Delicious and quaffable, though it escapes me why this beer is rated higher than many of their other IPAs and DIPAs on this website."
4532,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.45,"Received this can as an extra back in the summer. Could have sworn I'd reviewed regular ol Vietnamese Coffee Speedway before, but upon further review I found out it was the incredibly rare draft only 'Brewers Blend' rendition I had back in 2012 and incorrectly reviewed under this regular version. Good memories for that beer thanks to JLindros! Canned on 4/25/18. Review #3500. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice black hue with a good almost two finger dense mocha head that faded slowly to leave a thin, creamy blanket. Not really any lacing though the legs are nice enough. S - Aromas of nice typical speedway stout. creamy chocolate, malts, almost caramel. The coffee is not super aggressive but a nice creamy espresso. Quite pleasant and creamy. Very Vietnamese like combined with the chocolate and creamy notes it has an almost coffee ice cream like aroma. Decent lighter roast too. T - Taste is similar to the nose. Very nice creamy chocolate and roasted malts. Big and bold. Little bit of caramel and almost caramel cream candy like. There are flashes of warmth scattered here and there. The coffee is pleasant, not overly roasted and quite harmoneous with the base beer. Very nice rich coffee without being aggressive. Stays smooth and balanced. Finish is lingering roast with just a slight, slight coffee bitterness.  M - Mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy with the alcohol hidden very well. O - Overall this was a very, very pleasant stout. The coffee is great on the taste, however, I wish it popped a bit more on the nose. Same goes for the appearance, would like to see some lacing on this.  Serving Type: Can"
4533,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.75,"Had it onsite at the brewery yesterday. Tons of honey in the smell but not much on the tongue, lots of white wine type flavors. Great beer but probably not one of my top favorites."
4534,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.98,"Notes from Oct 2018 restaurant bottle share review: Super nice clean funky barnyard oaky corky woody spice complexity, slight tangerine apricot note New full 750ml bottle review: Bottling Date 16 Nov 18, Blend no 2 - season 18|19 Pours a gorgeous hazy amber gold orange with a creamy frothy white foam head. Smells oaky and funky with woody spice, toasty hay, barnyard funk, dusty horse blanket, slight acetic vinegar, caramelized malted barley, wheat, aged floral earthy herbal hops, lemon, apricot, hints of vanilla, straw, wine barrel, some spirits, and natural farmhouse essences. Tastes puckery upfront with dashes of lemon, apricot, cider, herbal earthy floral hops, woody spice, toasty hay, oak barrel, acetic vinegar, barnyard funk, horse blanket, caramelized wheaty malt, hints of vanilla, straw, wine, spirits, finishing dry with some farmhouse notes. Feels medium-fuller bodied, creamy smooth with lively moderate carbonation. Overall a really great oude geuze cuvée."

4537,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.93,Pours a thick rich dark with a small tan thin head. Smells like chocolate and more chocolate. Got a little of the coconut but man the thickness and the chocolate cake mouthfeel were amazing. An awesome beer.
4538,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.29,"Pours golden orange with thin head, nice lacing .  Aroma is earthy dank, get little of honey as well.  Taste follows aroma closely with sweetness coming in late  Mouthfeel solid for imperial ipa.  Overall this is a very good but not great beer. I am not sure it belongs in the top 200 beers but at the same time I did enjoy this quite a bit. I live in New England and get spoiled by treehouse and trillium"
4539,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,5.0,"500ml bottled on March 28, 2018 This beer pours pitch black with a lasting dense creamy tan brown foam head. Smells like beautiful black cherry, dark chocolate, charred oak, some meaty smoke, smooth rich bourbon, caramel, vanilla, dark brown sugar, some toasty roasted malts, with mild hops to balance. Taste is off the charts with huge robust dark chocolate notes, beautiful black cherry, some meaty smoke, charred oak, smooth rich and sweet bourbon, caramel, vanilla, dark brown sugar, toasty roasted malts, with mild earthy herbal floral grassy pine. Feels super luxurious and smooth, rich and sticky, thick and viscous, medium plus bodied with low carbonation. Overall a really great and truly amazing bourbon barrel aged imperial stout that I thought would be hard to live up to it's hype and the wait in line, but it’s worth it."
4540,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.11,"Immediately upon popping open the tab on this one I can tell I'm in for something rich and delicious. A dark liquid pours forth, Nearly jet black with a tight but creamy soft looking rich brown espresso head that lingers and lingers. Beautiful sticky lacing as well. This is gorgeous.  Nose is again big. Creamy and slightly nutty with a seeming wood influence to the dark coffee and light spice notes. I'm getting a decent amount of creaminess as well as nuttiness, so could this be a stout with hazelnut or perhaps lactose? Smells more like nutty creamy (erm...) than lactose creamy, at least to start.  Oily and dry and a nice high point of carbonation that helps usher the whole thing along. What it ushers in is cocoa/bakers chocolate and some further light cream. I'm leaning milk stout here, with a nod in the dark toasty side of things. Me likes. Almost kind of a coconut husk kind of thing with the nuttiness I was noting on the nose."
4541,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.2,"Waited to tick this one for years. Delicious fruit-foward lambic. Not nearly as dry as I was expecting based on other 3f products. Pours a pinkish red with ample, stubborn head for the style. Smells of funk, leading you to expect dryness in taste. Tart but sweet fruit up front. All the berries. Funk to finish but sweetness still prevails. Would gladly drink again; although expected drier."
4542,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.43,16oz can dated 12/12/20. Pours oily black with a dense brown head that struggled to surface. Minimal retention or lacing. Chocolate fudge with espresso and brownie bits in the nose. Full bodied with a crushed velvet mouthfeel. Chocolate cake batter with espresso beans on the palate. Finishes sweet and chocolaty with a light roast and fudge bits.
4543,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,3.97,"DC Lambic & Sour Summit on 4/14/2012, many thanks to brad for acquiring both the sour and regular version. Review of regular version with parenthetical to the sour version Appearance: Major gusher, cork hit the ceiling. Pour is very hazy and murky, a bit pink (sour version not such a gusher, probably because no sugar was added to it)"
4544,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.63,"Pours black with a finger of caramel-colored foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is roasty and dark, with cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate, cocoa nibs, toffee and molasses creating the bulk of the nose. Roasty and toasty malts are supportive and abundant. Flavor profile is huge, hitting notes of cinnamon, cardoman, nutmeg, molasses, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, coffee, chocolate and cocoa nibs. Big sugary notes, but they are balanced out by roasty and toasty malts. Mouth feel is thick and full, with a modest level of graininess. Overall, deep and expressive with loads of flavor. Lovely stout! Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 750mL bottle. 10th anniversary bottle."
4545,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.75,"2019 I've had loads of Barley wines in my day and they can all be problematic; too much alcohol heat, too drying, a vague cough syrup taste; etc. They're big beers and if one aspect of them is over pronounced it can be a really hard beer to finish.  This 2019 §ucaba is nearly perfect. It's slightly sweet and subtly blends boozy vanilla and oak flavors together with a rich maltiness. There's not one flavor that really stands out it's perfectly blended.  It's one of those beers you have a tough time coming up with words for, you're too lost in the moment. The only downside is of course it's $15 plus 12 oz bottle and it goes too quickly."
4546,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.62,A: Poured into a tulip glass to a hazy bright yellow topped by a finger of dense white head which retains well and leaves excellent lacing as it recedes
4547,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.66,"Truly amazing IPA. Citrus nose, good hops, but not too bitter. to be more specific, tastes of grapefruit, tropical fruits and the smell is really divine.."
4548,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.64,"Poured into a snifter from the fridge and allowed to warm while sipping over the course of an hour or so. Appearance - Thick and black. Small amount of head dissipated quickly. Head was chestnut brown. Aroma - Rich vanilla and bourbon barrel sweetness and light coconut Taste - Big roasted dark malt tastes, vanilla all over, toasted coconut, and plenty of bourbon barrel caramelly sweetness. Smooth and not boozy for 13.5% (2020 bottling)  Feel - Medium to thick mouthfeel. Sufficient for a stout of this flavor and ABV. Not too thick or thin. Not overly carbonated. Overall - An excellent stout. Adjuncts aren't overdone or out of place. This is a very good beer."
4549,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.37,"A- 12oz can poured into a tulip glass with a lightly hazy golden body and a thick and creamy cap. The white foam peaks up at an inch high with great retention and a gorgeous consistency. Lacing starts with thick blankets around the glass and massive rings forming at each sip. S- Not the juiciest or most pungent hop aroma but still a very effective and most importantly clean one. Citra brings mango, tangerine, soft citrus, dank, floral and bubble gum/melon aromas and the grains are there just enough to provide light support. T- The Citra once again is of central importance providing a wealth of different hop flavors with medium overall strength and a nice clean balance. Opens up with mango and melon before leading into lime, grapefruit, dank, floral and herbal hops. Juicy with hints of crackery base grains. MF- The appearance sort of hinted at this but this is soft and almost luscious, kind of surprising for the style and ABV. The texture is creamy and not quite chewy but very smooth with a high level of carbonation. Ends with a clean floral bitterness. Citra is a classic and this beer delivers the goods and showcases what you can do with one good hop. Juicy mango paired with soft citrus and floral/herbal hop notes on top of an incredibly smooth mouthfeel."
4550,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,"On tap at The Veil Summer Fest. Nice orange golden hazy look with some lacing. Lots of citrus and papaya type notes in the nose, a bit zesty as well. Taste follows nose with lots of citrus flavor and a good dose of earthiness. Moderate mouthfeel due to the flaked wheat, light carbonation, construction and balance the excellence you expect from Trillium."
4551,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.68,"22oz bottle of the 2020 vintage poured into a snifter on 3/31/21. Pours little to no head. A thin cream ring lingers atop opaque black liquid with dark amber along its edges. Aromas of toasted malt, vanilla, oak, caramel, and dried cherries. Flavors are burnt marshmallow, vanilla, and dried cherries. Peaty oak and bourbon on the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a discernable alcohol burn. No effervescence. Silky. Such a strong and assertive beer. Big bourbon flavors and aromas in a smooth, silky, and boozy beer. Very special but almost unapproachable initially. Still, delicious and its own worthy occasion. Outstanding!"
4552,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.75,"For me, I have experienced all of the hoof hearted beers I have wanted to sample. This.... this is the best by far. It is absolutely delicious with every sip you take. It has only gotten better with age. I can't really describe it too much. The aroma is pineapple, mango, peach, orange. The taste is straight juice with some hop bitterness. And the alcohol is covered so well that I can't even seem to distinguish where it begins and ends. It is one of the best examples of what this brewery can do and one of the best beers I have had all year. I truly love this beer and the 16.99 I paid for the four pack (x3 because I bought 3 total 4 packs) is well worth it. I think they have finally found there stride at hoof. I had roller blabe and didn't enjoy it till I waited 5 weeks post batch. South of Eleven was excellent. I really liked Konkey Dong. And this beer... this beer is truly why I drink the style. I just absolutely love it! I hope they can brew it more then once a year, but if that is the case... I will be back next year! Great job Hoof. You have finally made me want to consistently go to every release!"
4553,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.51,"Big frothy dark tan head; good retention. Nose is full of roasted barley, dark coffee, maple syrup, and brown sugar, and accented by cinnamon. Sweet, creamy, and rich on the palate - not unlike egg nog. The coffee adds a sharp earthiness that barely manages to cut through the maple and cinnamon. Big creamy milk porter base is a lovely jumping off point for these flavors. Could use more coffee flavor, but the maple is a wonderful balance, bringing the exact right amount of sweetness, along with a woody note. Full bodied, sticky, and with a little bit of alcohol heat. I really like the way the alcohol isn't hidden hear, but it's incredibly drinkable and easy to savor. This is a wonderful beer, worthy of consideration as one of the best maple stouts/porters. The higher ABV provides more of a body than FB MBCP, while keeping it single digits makes it more approachable than many other cinnamon flavored stouts."
4554,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.42,"i have long been trying to track this one down, and i am stoked to finally have gotten the chance to enjoy it, blend three, an awfully fine example of the style, adjunct free if i understand it right, and truly wanting for nothing. it certainly is a beast of a beer, not just at this strength, but also with this amount of oak and sweetness, its a lot of everything, and its a proper sipper to say the least. deep deep caramel in color, reddish in the right light, neither murky nor clear, someplace in between, with just a short frothy khaki colored layer of foam on it from the bottle. the nose is crazy, an awful lot of bourbon and oak, i think it was heaven hill barrels they uses for this, and two years in them! heavy vanilla, wet tobacco, and english toffee abound there, some light tannins from the wood, as well as some oxidation when i taste it, something i never really mind in the style, and really is a sign of its maturity. the malt is huge, sweet like brown sugar and maple, and carrying that vanilla tune pretty nicely though the whole drink, a ton of body on it and a long linger even with the abundant alcohol at the end, its persistent. oxidation meets a robust english yeast strain too, bready and doughy even, adding a lot of depth. no hops really to speak of, although overall this somehow has some balance between all the elements at the end. whiskey for miles, boozy and sweet, dense and even chewy, but also fully wintery, warming, and satisfying. something to be shared for sure, but a prime example of the style and what extended barrel ageing looks like. impressive and worthy of being celebrated. that said, not the most interesting barleywine i have ever had, not the most dialed in i dont think either, but a special beer without a doubt!"
4555,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.52,"one of the jester king beers that i have been unable to track down until now, highly acclaimed and on my list forever, stoked to finally have sourced it. its definitely one of the best apricot wild beers in the game, so intense and so natural at the same time, in a lot of ways reminds me of when i tried cascade apricot for the first time, and just realized that there was no more true expression of apricots in beer than that, this is the same, but much less sour, and with the classic jester king funky yeast mix that makes their beers so distinctive all the time. a pulpy orange hazy look to this one, under a short but lasting white head. the nose is incredible, the best feature of this for me and where i really appreciate the apricots most, fuzzy and real, fleshy and juicy and sweet and ripe, their absolute essence. some higher level bacterial acidity evident here too, but all in service of the fruit. nice oak to the flavor, gives it a richness, and a light wine and vanilla thing in the flavor, beautiful with the pale wheat malt and the sugars in the fruit, its funky and sour and also kind of desserty, a little more left at the end of this one than in a lot of their beers, especially these small bottle fruited releases, and i love how long it lingers. more sour than others too, especially at temperature, but it all works so well together. epic expression of apricots in a really amazingly funky and mature wild beer, up there with the best of jester king, and certainly worth all the hype!"
4556,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.59,"FINALLY!!!! On tap at Kane 1/10. Allowed to warm as I could. L: Light tan head with good retention. Leaves a bit of a ring. Dark black. S: Lot going on here. Roasted malts, cinnamon, maple, coffee. Roasty and on point. T: Follows nose in waves of flavor. Cinnamon and coffee up front, then maple and roastiness come in and hang out for a while. F: Full bodied, not much carbonation. Full points for high level of difficulty in construction and balance and they pull it off wonderfully. O: So worth the wait. Hope it's not another four years before the next one."
4557,King JJJuliusss,100,IPA - New England,8.4%,4.71,"...because what really IS a 5 in an IPA 'Look' ??? but we all know the reputation. if i had any 'bucket list' beers left, this would be one of them... and here i am! but it's just another very-well done Treehouse brew... not as rich as someof the other 'standards' but very very good.... it deserves the rating i gave"
4558,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.57,"Delicious hazy goodness. Fluffy mouthfeel, strong flavors of peach, grapefruit, and pineapple. Very little bitterness. Almost like a nice sauvignon blanc in the flavor. Yumy"
4559,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.65,Acquired via trade. Whale I have been seeking for long time. Did not disappoint.  Pour is deep black with lingering alcohol legs and mocha minimal head.  I don’t get coffee aroma but this is 2016 bottle so I am not surprised. Get light bourbon and little barrel.  Taste is where this beer shines. Super smooth. Nice oily finish and coffee does come in late with nice finish. Like this better than parabola which I really enjoy.  Mouthfeel is fantastic . Not thin like I had heard. Medium body and oily finish.  I have to say this is a great beer. I have wanted this for a long time
4560,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.45,"Complex, subtle, sophisticated, beautiful. get the sour funky farmy smell upfront and at first sip, but then more complexity comes through with in the palate, a bit of the citrus flavours you get in a white wine, beautifully balanced Wanted to try this one for a while, got to have it as part of a Zwanze Day event here in Australia.  A 150ml pour from a keg shipped over from Belgium, would love to try a full bottle or two to appreciate it fully, but even among some very other nice beers, it stood out. well worth a try if you can get your hands on it."
4561,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.75,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Yellow Session. Lots of cacao, ice cream and dark malts on the aroma. Taste has sweet cacao, fudge, caramel, bourbon and toffee. Well balanced, smooth coffee finish with medium bitterness."
4562,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,3.5,"Released 12/13/19; drank 2/16/20 @ the Yarchives.  Black appearance.  A violent pour yielded a big tan head; decent lace.  Oak, cream, dark roast coffee bean, dark chocolate syrup and mild bourbon notes in the nose.  Creamy, thick mouthfeel.  Green pepper, cream, dark chocolate & dark roast coffee bean flavors up front; oak & bourbon heat notes on the finish.  Almost a parody of the coffee stout cliche's...easy pass for me moving forward."
4563,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.85,"Pours a thick pitch black. There was actually a 1 finger tan head on this beer. It didn't last too long, and there's no lacing on the glass. "

4567,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.41,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of chocolate notes with some residual sugar notes and some bourbon notes are also perceptible. Taste is a mix of chocolate notes with some bourbon notes, light vanilla with some residual sugar notes. Body is full with nice oily texture with some creamy notes, good carbonation and no real alcohol is perceptible. Greta porter with nice depth and complexity, good drinkability with just the right amount of residual sugar notes."
4568,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.5,"fresh growler drank on 8/3/2017 exploding carbonation but this is a really well done DIPA. Balanced bitterness, with complex hop flavors...ripe lemon, pineapple, grapefruit, earthy, and dank...hoping they bottle this so I can try again"

4570,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.49,"Incredible stout. I initially rated it as an imperial stout - was fooled by its depth, complexity, flavors and richness - and then when submitting realized my error and had to change accordingly. Knowing that it was actually a stout made it incredibly impressive. 1/24/20 date printed on can. Pours a thick almost sludgy very dark brown, almost black color that was incredibly opaque. Lots of fluffy tan head and some spotty lingering lacing that settled into small soapy rings. Smells amazing, deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, caramel, bread, malt, roasted nuts, brown sugar, maybe a little stone fruit. Taste follows the nose, incredible depth and balance, again reminded me of an imperial stout. Definitely not like any regular stout I've had before. Smooth, sticky, luscious mouthfeel that coated the palate, good amount of carbonation. No alcohol burn even as the beer warmed. Fantastic!"
4571,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.43,"Pour is murky, light golden yellow. huge chalk white head. Excellent lacing and retention."
4572,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.53,"16 oz can into a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy amber gold color with 2 fingers of effervescent off-white head. Decent retention. Leaves a good amount of sticky lacing before settling into a thin cap of foam. The aroma is very citrusy up front, bringing notes of grapefruit, lemon and orange juice. There's some subtle tropical notes as well, namely fresh honeydew melon. Nice amount of pine and sweet, doughy malt. The flavor follows the nose: A huge wave of grapefruit and candied orange with a surprising honeydew melon punch. The sweet, grainy malt character is very much present. There's even a very subtle note of almonds in the back. Finishes piney, grassy, earthy and bitter. Absolutely a hop grenade but extremely well-balanced. Feel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and smooth with just a hint of booze. Dry with a lingering coating of bitterness. Overall, this beer definitely lives up to the name, as well as the hype. The hops punch you in the face, but apologize afterwards with a sweet malt character. Fruity, yet earthy and bitter. The ABV is very well-hidden."
4573,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.53,"Canned 5 days ago. L — Pours that nice orange juice haze that is characteristic of Trillium. A little less milky than I was expecting. Finger of white head dissipates fairly quickly, leaving spotty lacing	"
4574,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.59,"Poured into a Teku glass. Pours midnight black and as viscous as motor oil. Minuscule dark tan head. Dark fudge and whiskey feature primarily on the nose, with some vanilla, oak, and a touch of caramel also there. Taste follows, in a sense- heavy chocolate fudge with a huge, but not overpowering, amount of whiskey. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, full bodied, with a lower carb appropriate to style. Better than the non-BA Even More Jesus IMO. An huge beer, and a good one."
4575,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.99,"2018 bottle(silver wax). The hype is real! Been wanting this for as long as I can remember. Glad I finally got a chance to try a hefty pour at a nice share. It stole the show around a bunch of BIG beers. It’s crazy how much this tastes like toasted marshmallow fluff. Zero heat, and smooth as hell."
4576,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,5.0,"Reviewing a bottle of the test batch for Cable Car Kriek from The Lost Abbey out of San Marcos, California. Major thanks to Paul and Jonathan for sharing this rare treat with me! Score: 100 The only thing I know about the bottling date of this beer is that it predates the 2011 release of Cable Car Kriek. My buddy got a Cable Car Kriek label sticker, which he put on the otherwise unmarked bottle. Served in a Cantillon stemmed balloon glass and enjoyed on 11/16/13. Review is from iPhone notes. Appearance: Pours a finger-plus of white frothy head. Color is a murky red-orange color with a bit of yellow-orange fade towards the edges of the body when held up to light. Excellent lacing and retention. 5/5 Smell: Cherry, then dank cinnamon, funk, wood, dank spice, fig, raisin, wood and lemon. Hint of tobacco and vanilla. Lots of unexpected cinnamon present in the nose, which is ridiculously complex and perfectly balanced between all the elements present. Just enough funk is present to give it an added dimension of complexity without detracting at all from the appeal of the other aromatics. 5/5 Taste: Tart cherry hits first, then cinnamon, spice, vanilla and wood. Musty funk on the midpalate, oddly reminisce of that Cantillon house character with a little bit of age. Vanilla and cherrywood finish, light lemon backbone. Dark cherry notes and a little bit of cocoa-like flavor come through too as the beer warms up. The cherry flavor persists throughout, and lingers nicely in the finish. I love how well the vanilla flavor plays with sour characters without being medicinal or coming across as being out of place. All the flavors here are so perfectly integrated. There is so much going on, and it all works. The cinnamon character is a nice unique twist, though it is less prominent on the palate than it was in the nose. 5/5 Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, spot on carbonation (rare for a Lost Abbey beer). Great mix of sweet and sour, with a dry finish. 5/5 Overall: One of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure to consume. It is complex, robust in flavor, tart, balanced and insanely drinkable. There is a reason this is one of the most sought after beers out there. I would not say it is worth the $600-800 it commands on the secondary market, but I enjoyed it more than M, which costs much more to acquire. My only quip here is that someone stole the bottle from Paul later in the evening. Seek this one out with confidence. Cost: $50 for a 750 ml bottle (good luck finding it that for that price nowadays)."
4577,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.28,"Big, beefy DIPA with a huge ABV that drinks incredibly easy. Hoppy, piney and floral aroma; taste of orange rind, mandarin orange, mango, apricot, grapefruit, tobacco and green tea. Outstanding citrus and bitter profile with a soft mouthfeel, but it's not a balanced beer - it's a big time hop-forward DIPA that comes on strong and doesn't let up. With a 10% ABV I'm not sure what else you could expect. Prepare your face. They've employed magic to make such a huge beer so palatable."

4579,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.5,"Evil Twin is a perennial goat for me when it comes to breweries (overpriced, under good), but this is an unqualified winner. Great barrel character. Seek out."
4580,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.2,This beer is smoooooth. The flavors aren't harsh but still complex. It's got citrus with hop flavor lingering. The feel is that of carbonated Sunny-D. This beer isn't one you get because you want something different. This is the beer you get when you want a NE DIPA done right. It's the best thing to come out of Iowa since Field of Dreams :p
4581,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.49,"12oz bottle, served in a stemmed glass. Pours a thick, oily dark black body, one finger white head, short retention, not much in way of lacing. Smell is sweet rum, vanilla, sugarcane, milk chocolate, a bit of sweet coconut, cocoa. It's mildly boozy, but rum is more or less always that way. Flavour is chewy milk chocolate, cocoa, a bit of sweet and oily coconut, more milk chocolate, a smooth and extended run of rum throughout, with a smooth, mild vanilla sweetness lingering on the backend. Mainly it's vanilla and rum mingling together on the backend, which is rounded out by a slight cocoa-like bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial, lower but still appropriate carbonation, mildly boozy rum on the finish. A very good barrel-aged adjunct stout that isn't quite pastry stout level but it's an excellent stout in its own right. Probably one of the few rum barrel-aged stouts that I have really enjoyed. I do agree that this one is a step up above Bourbon Paradise as the rum seems to work better with the adjuncts than the bourbon."
4582,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,3.96,"Dark brown and slightly hazy with no visible carbonation, and no head. There’s a slightly amber tinge.  It smells of black licorice, Carmel, Oakwood, brown sugar and dates.  The taste follows the nose.  Almost No carbonation.  I got this in Portland Oregon and I’m drinking it in Redding California February 16, 2020. This is the 2018 version."
4583,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.26,"Poured to a teku glass. A: The body is yellow, bright, opaque and hazy with a matte finish. The head is white but shows medium to weak retention and no lacing."
4584,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.74,"This is head and shoulders above the other Flora variants and among HF's best saisons. Had both batches at a recent tasting. Both are excellent, but batch 1 had a flavor that had burned in and integrated, and a bit more funk that put it over the top. Seek out."
4585,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.5,"Though this drinks more like a wine it still keeps a beer under structure. Tart white grapes, champagne like dryness and sweetness, earthy vinous notes and a nice apricot make this so good."
4586,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.15,"Bottle @ Presidential Suite. Thanks, Adam. Redemption from Bully Guppy. Black pour with a finger of tan foam. Tons of bourbon, maple syrup, and vanilla. Nice coffee, cocoa powder, and toffee. Some burnt sugar and a bit of licorice. Nice dark fruits, too. Flavor has plenty of sugar and malt sweetness. Lots of caramel, toffee, and maple syrup. Nice bourbon and vanilla, too. Good dark fruit character, cocoa powder, and decent coffee. Good stuff."
4587,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.84,Thanks goes out to TheMattJones88 for this brew. 16oz. Can
4588,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,Solid IPA. Colored orange with a white head. Dank aroma with great citrus smell. Medium bodied feel. Very solid taste and great overall IPA. Solid at 8%
4589,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.27,"Pours an opaque peach juice color,with an egg shell like meringue head.Smell is grassy grains,cantaloupe,clementine.Taste hops,grains,""Citra is showcased"" definite mango like profile. Feels mildly acidic,well carbonated, very well balanced,finishes semi dry albeit juicy. Overall this is a top shelf DIPA, only wish it were organic."
4590,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,5.0,"2017 vintage Smell: The Barrel is the star of the show on the nose. The whiskey that comes through is so smooth and strong it’s singes the nose hairs in the best way. There also a little bit of spice coming through as well a touch of vanilla, coconut, tobacco, oak and leather. Also there are some underlying chocolate notes. Dark chocolate, and coco powder. This beer smells like a grade A whiskey with beer attributes. This smells so strong and so damn amazing. Taste: Right upfront the beer hits with big chocolate notes. Dark chocolate brownie batter and dusty coco powder. The beer transitions to the mid palette where your hit with some dark fruit. Plum, fig, raisin as well as a touch of vanilla. The barrel starts to make an assertive presence as well. I get some whiskey leather and tobacco that carry on throughout the finish. In the finish this beer is all barrel. Whiskey, oak, coconut, leather, tobacco, maple syrup, rye spice, and a touch of dark cherry round out this beautiful beer. The whiskey and barrel notes linger in the aftertaste. Feel: Full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. The beer is smooth but drinks big. This is definitely a classic example of a sipper. Overall: This is a wonderful beer that highlights everything a whiskey barrel has to offer. If you don’t like whiskey you probably won’t enjoy this because it is the start of the show. The whiskey barrel is really smooth and present but it never gets to hot and still allows for the beer to be there in the background. Overall this is a 100/100 to me, but is it worth the high trading price tag probably not. Barrel aged sump is just as good if not better in my opinion and it goes for a lot less. Still this is an amazing beer! That is worth getting if your willing to pay the price of admission."
4591,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.5,"Had a hazy orange appearance with a pineapple aroma. Fruit forward taste, predominately grapefruit and orange. Finishes a little dry. Has some carbonation that lingers on the tongue. I really enjoyed this beer, as I do with most TG offerings. This beer had more juiciness than bitterness."
4592,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,5.0,"Batch #2 at the brewery on 3-4-17. Shared 3 ways so my wallet didn't feel the pain that much. Pours extreme dark brown with no head. This is a spectacular example of how barrel aging a barley wine can transform into a whole different brew. Sweet and succulent on the nose, with toffee and caramel notes blended with a light barrel note. Taste is off the chart. There was a grainy particulate or something that my tongue picked up that melted on the tongue and the toffee flavor that became borderline chocolate. Incredible."
4593,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.63,"This was the best beer I’ve had in a long time, the can reads that you should drink from the can so I didn’t get the colour, however the can had a good look to it, so I rated that a three and a half. The smell was pure tangerines and mango, very good smell. The taste was crisp with piney mosaic hops following the fruity taste at the beginning. It does have a little bit of a bite on the aftertaste. Rather bitter finish."
4594,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.81,2015  Enjoyed this year the most by a long shot. Most blueberry forward out of any vintage of Blåbær I have had to date. Other vintages being: '12 & '16
4595,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.44,"Look: Pitch black, with a finger of dark brown (almost reddish) head that quickly reduces to a ring. Smell: Sweet cinnamon rolls, coconut, and chocolate. It smells like a dessert. Taste: Following the nose, sweet coconut and chocolate with a hint of bitterness underneath. A little roast malt follows, but the coconut and chocolate are predominate. Mouthfeel: Decently full body, though perhaps a little thinner than it could be. Minimal carbonation. Overall: While normally barrel-aged imperial porters can be cloyingly sweet or overpowering in their bitterness, Last Buffalo is a decadent treat that's almost a privilege to drink."
4596,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.15,"Thanks to Tomme for bringing this to the Lost Abbey tasting.  Beer pours a hazy pink lemonade color with medium white head. Smell is a fantastic cherry aroma with a nice amount of sour and more funk than I expected. After the intensity of the early Veritas beers, this one is considerably more tame. It's still sour, but it's very restrained with a great sweeter cherry flavor - more like a cherry pie than a big sour cherry. Nothing about this beer particularly stands out, but it's still quite good. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer is a great tasty cherry beer, but after all of the crazy beers we've just had, it doesn't quite stand up to them."
4597,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.29,"Usually I blind-taste beers but I've read so much about this one over the years I certainly know of it's reputation. That said beyond being a monastic Quad I do not presently recall any specific points/features of this beer and have not read any reviews below (yet!)... I don't know what to expect, am I 100% honestly going to find this a 'Score:100' beer? "
4598,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.53,"Pours slick black with a thin mocha colored head settles quickly to a thin ring. Aroma - Bourbon dark fruit, chocolate and vanilla. Taste - Lots of chocolate, bourbon soaked raisins, oak and vanilla. Feel - Surprisingly smooth lots of heat and burn from the alcohol but pretty easy drinking Overall - Big boozy stout slick really tasty and easy drinking."
4599,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.67,Brown appearance with no head. Aroma is a very nice barleywine with a touch of cognac. Taste is a very smooth barleywine with a nice touch of cognac.
4600,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.31,"12 oz draft pour at Churchkey in DC Hops: Centennial, Chinook, Columbus, Simcoe, Warrior  Well here it is. A legend of Vermont craft beer. A relic. I love Edward, and this seems to be the double IPA version of that beer. I consider it part of the first wave of NE style IPAs, along with Double Sunshine and Heady Topper. Hugely influential. A little darker than most made these days and look at those old school ""C"" hops! This would have blown my mind in 2012, but now it's merely a great beer of many around these days. I prefer HF's newer offerings, to be perfectly honest. But I'm a lucky son of a bitch to have tried this."
4601,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.3,"On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma is funky and floral with unripe peach and apricot and hay notes. Taste is tart, fruity and lactic with some fruit pit bitterness."
4602,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.02,Can. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Big citrus hop aromas. Tangy citrus and stone fruit hop notes. Loads of caramel malts. Good body and mouthfeel.
4603,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,3.92,Bottle courtesy of Scottsbeer. 
4604,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.46,From can. Pours a milky orange. Very impressive head for a trip/abv. Sticky lacing stays in place well. Minimal booze in the nose. Honeydew and grapefruit rind? Great smell anyhow. Very sweet to mask abv. Noticeable carb but an overall smooth finish. Nice and sticky. Solid beer.
4605,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.53,"Gifted to me by @leperjim. Bottled 6/3. Clear dark bronze color, minimal head and lacing. Mildly dank sharp hop smell, little bit of pine. Taste is bitter and bold hops. Feel is crisp, clean, mouth watering and medium body. Excellent “old style” IPA."
4606,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.59,"Batch 3 poured from a 750mL bottle into a De Garde snifter. Thanks Ryan for sharing this bottle! Pours a hazy golden orange body with a twin finger white head that reduces slowly to leave a ring of retention and spotty lacing.  On the nose, lots of woody oak, comes through with a funky saison yeast aroma.. grassy, citrus and lactic, spices, funk, yeasty, grassy, and an almost cedar-like smell.  On the tongue is a nicely balanced tartness with tons of oaky saison notes, funky barnyard, spices, green apple, and a cedary taste come through, white wine, champagne-like but not too dry. Medium-high carbonation and easy drinking, medium-light body.  This was totally worth the hype and I'm glad I got to try it. A superbly balanced and flavorful wild."
4607,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.27,Pours a murky golden color. 3 finger slightly off white frothy head. The head retention is damn good. Some lacing on the glass. 
4608,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,3.97,"Review is based on the dregs (last in line for a pour). Pours a cloudy orange hue akin to Sunny Delight. Nose expresses citrus, rind a just a hint of the wine barrel. Taste follows nose - a little little yeasty, but to be expected considering the pour was off the bottom of the bottle. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation. All and all, quite enjoyable; however, I'd like to revisit with a proper pour."
4609,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.84,"Wow, that is a powerful smell. It's a combination of wood, cocoa, licorice and alcohol but mostly the cocoa wood. OK the wood and dark chocolate come through first and then deep pungent bitterness.  It's a full bodied stout.  There is carbonation but it barely cuts through the thickness. The alcohol is warming. It finishes dry and bitter. It's fantastic. If you want an extremely powerful stout without a hint of whiskey, this couldn't be more perfect. It gets a 5.8 out of 6 not a perfect score because it's almost overpowering but still great."
4610,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,3.95,"Sweet and sour, white wine, oak barrel nose on this one! Taste follows well with a sour and acidic chardonnay white wine finish and swallow. Decent depth and feel."
4611,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.66,"Poured out of a 500ml bottle into a Duvel tulip. It pours as a thick inky liquid that has a little trouble raising a dark brown head. The head dissipates quickly and leaves no head. The smell of this beer is stunning. The coffee and vanilla smacks you in the nose first with the malt, bourbon and a hint of maple filling out the experience. The taste is sweet with maple and vanilla merging with chocolate, coffee and bourbon. There is a bit of booze in the flavor but it seems in balance with the rest of the flavors. This is an amazing breakfast stout."
4612,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.49,"From a 16.9oz bottle dated 8/27/21 into a tulip. Pours a very hazy, nearly opaque orange with about two and a half fingers of white head. Decent retention, incredible lacing. Smells strongly of pineapple. Background citrus, pine and floral notes. Some juice in the taste-pineapple, orange but a lot of bitter piney, resiny goodness. Sticky mouthfeel. Strong bitter aftertaste. Low carbonation. Medium to full-bodied. Dang. I mean DANG! This is an awesome beer. Had it on tap before, but so much better out of the bottle. Not much bad can be said except maybe this ridiculous 16.9oz single bottle format. But, for this one, it's worth it."
4613,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.5,"As one of the top beers, this one has some high expectations to live up to. Which it pretty much does all the way. Very sweet, very aromatic, front heavy on the bourbon and barrel. Dark fruity notes along with chocolate and vanilla.  Rich and thick like diesel oil, lingering bourbon taste.  Definitely worthy of its high status."
4614,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.87,"Circumstances: Pint can poured into a clear pint glass. No worries, there's not as much head expected as if it were a NEIPA. Expectations met, little head and little glass lace. I smell hops and for a reason. They're in there. This is likely the best tasting beer I've ever had. I also don't know another beverage with this much alcohol that hides it as well. Maybe not perfect in every category, but just about the best in the ones that matter most."
4615,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.47,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip. The true motor-oil black pour. Thick and black as can be. The nose is pure chocolate fudge - in fact, it smells identical to a chocolate ganache I made last week. The palate and mouthfeel are what really propel this beer to greatness. Chocolate ganache blends perfectly with appropriately subtle barrel aging, and darker fruits start to emerge only as the beer warms. In terms of mouthfeel, this is perhaps the thickest beer I've tasted. It's an incredible tour-de-force of the style, and one that does the chocolate side of Imp Stouts in an appreciably fresh way. Excellent."
4616,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.36,"Poured from 16oz tall can into a tulip. Canned 7/1/20. Appearance: turbid medium-yellow hue with a thick finger of frothy ivory foam atop. Looks good indeed! Smell: orangey, a little piney, a little herbal, and nicely juicy. Straightforward, but enticing. Taste: lots of orange and tropical fruit notes, along with a nice piney note as well. Very juicy, but with a nicely balance bitterness. A bit on the sweet side, but still, very good indeed! Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and a nice creaminess. Overall: the flavor of this beer is great; it really appeals to me. Another top-notch beer from Tree House."
4617,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.03,**
4618,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.22,"375 mL corked and caged, bottled on 9/2/2016. My friend brought back two bottles of this from the brewery for me a few years ago. I drank one fresh and the other after cellaring for 3 years. Ruby brown color with a small off-white head. Good clarity. Aroma hits you with a strong funkiness up front and a wave of sour cherries. Taste is tart and acidic but it really mellows and smooths out as you drink your way through the beer. A little oak in the background as well. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. I remember enjoying it more fresh than aged. There is probably a sweet spot of around one year of aging for this. It isn't the most complex beer as far as flavors go, but it wouldn't be my pick to introduce someone to sour/wild ales either. Just a well-made beer with few flaws. #46 Top 250 Rated Beers"
4619,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.75,L: Pours a bright ruby red that recedes into a slight cloudy cranberry hue with a light pink foam and ample lacing 
4620,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.46,"16oz can dated 8/4/21. Pours cloudy yellow with an inch of white head. Moderate retention and lacing. Pungent earthy spruce in the nose with almost a hint of menthol. Medium bodied with a soft, tacky mouthfeel. Big piney bite on the palate with minimal malt and a firm bitterness. Finishes dry with lingering spruce juice."
4621,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.92,"Really hard to beat, quintessential IPA that merges the classic bitter west coast style with the softness of NEIPAs.  This review is based on a can purchased from the brewery 8 days ago, with a stamp from 10 days ago. Look: The looks are probably the least enchanting, but still stellar. Mild haze, but not too thick. Based on this alone, I'd assume tasty but not this tasty. Walnut wood with a bit of glow. Really nice lacing on the glass, but head disappears rather quickly. Smell: Grapefruit juice, maybe a bit of tangerine. Fuck does this shit smell dank and delish. Taste: More grapefruit, but a pine needle slipped into the juicer and contaminated the grapefruit juice in the best possible way.  Feel: Medium carb, but smooth like honey. Not smooth like the over-fluffed beers that are dominating the east coast right now, just right. Overall: Easily the best beer I've had in the last year, maybe more. The Double Fuzzy is great when you're in the market for a tad bit more gravity (and have a bit more time to recuperate the next day). If you're driving by New Haven, check to see if they've brewed it/canned it. The gent at the brewery said they brew it every month or so and usually run out of cans within a few days. Well worth the 15-20 min detour from i95 if you're passing by."
4622,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.65,"The 2014 vintage, poured on-site at the Hill Farmstead taproom.  L: Golden copal pour with medium head and lacing.  S: Virtually everything on the top half of the bottle pour is wine and barrel. The bottom half of the bottle opens up with floral notes, some honey, a little citrus, and subtle funk.  T: Wine barrels up front, followed by tart citrus flavors and some earthy/floral notes, finishing with honey and a touch of lingering bitterness F: Soft, juicy, and dry on the end.  O: I had waited over two years to try this beer, with unrealistically high expectations, so I was slightly disappointed when I finally had a pour of Ann and did not have the ""life-altering, 5-out-of-5, this is the best beer in the world"" experience.  I have had this beer three times now. Ann is a fantastic beer but not worthy of its hype. To me, it fails to break the Hill Farmstead Top Five."
4623,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,3.75,"Canned 9/21/17; drank 9/28/17 @ the Yarchives.  Opaque dull yellow/orange appearance.  A rough pour yielded a small, noisy off-white head which quickly dissipated; no lace.  Pine, fresh ganja, grapefruit & dry grass notes in the nose.  Medium thick mouthfeel.  Dry grapefruit & ganja flavors up front; dry grass & dry pine notes on the finish.  Dry, dry, dry; not really juicy at all. Drinkable, I suppose, but the worst of the fog series unquestionably."
4624,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.34,"Canned 06/22/21 Appearance - Poured a few ounces into a glass, hazy and straw in color with a white, half finger width head. Fair retention. Decent lacing, with some broken webbing, lines and small spotting. The rest of the review comes from drinking out of the can.  Smell - Really hoppy aroma. Orange, green leaf, lesser grapefruit, pine and a light bready sweetness.  Taste - Follows the nose to a tee. The fresh hop character really stands out. Orange peel, grapefruit, green leaf, lesser pine and an underlying bready malt sweetness. Not super complicated, but that hop freshness can't be understated. Aftertaste lingers with grapefruit pith and a hint of grass.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with fair carbonation. Slick, easy drinker with a clean, slighty dry finish.  Overall - It's great, but didn't quite live up to the hpe for me. Actually reminds me a lot of Heady. I'd love to try them side-by-side at some point."
4625,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.44,L: Midnight obsidian and mahogany hues with a thin sandy head
4626,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.45,It's been awhile since I experienced MBCP so was really excited to try this one. It does not disappoint. Smells like pure maple syrup with just a hint of coffee. Was worried the maple may be over powering but the balance is just about perfect. Maple is present but not too sweet. The smokey roasty quality balances it out nicely. Would definitely seek this out again.
4627,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.6,"Black color with creamy brownish head. Aroma is spicy with some liquorice and aromatic herbs. Also dark fruits and whiskey. Taste is bittersweet, roasty, chocolate forward with well integrated bourbon. Medium to full bodied with soft mouthfeel. Overall it's a really well balanced and tasty beer."
4628,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.05,"Look: Extremely dark chocolate brown, almost black. One finger of fizzy tan head with short retention. Smell: Dark chocolate, roast coffee, a little chili pepper. Taste: Milder than expected. Mocha, a tiny hint of smoky chili. No real hop presence at all, bitterness included. Mouthfeel: Syrupy, with mild carbonation. Overall: Despite the reputation of the Bomb, I found it to be very similar to numerous other imperial stouts and not really a standout offer. Their Christmas Bomb was far better."
4629,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.51,"L: Clear orange yellow with decent head on top. Modest lacing. S: Not in your face by any means, but some nice citrus, mango, pine, and herbal spiciness. Some noticeable malt character as well with some biscuity aromatics showing up. T: Firm bitterness, followed by big juicy citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Some very biscuity malt comes in to balance things out and the finish is very clean and moderately dry. Overall: A delicious DIPA with a very nice malt balance. It isn't sweet at all, and that is what makes the malt/hop interplay work so well. I highly recommend this beer."
4630,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.37,"A bit of a gusher. Pours clear, dark gold with strong effervescence and three fingers of rocky, meringue-like, yellowed head. Decent retention gives way to thick, webbed lacing. A little lemon and mixed fruit, clear wood, a hint of must and some pepper in the very enticing aroma. Sour lemon again up front in the taste. Certainly tart, but without being an enamel stripper. Balanced somewhat by the strong wood, a little funk and again just a hint of mixed fruit sweetness. Maybe a little mineral water or clay in the finish. Very soft feel. A touch more heft than expected. Soft, tickley carbonation. A beautifully crafted beer from start to finish. A little more robust than some super refined beers, while still managing to expertly balance the sourness, tartness, funk and wood. A real treat."
4631,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.43,"12 oz. , canned 5/7/20 Pours out with a light haze, typical almond amber under a moderate light khaki cap, that leaves a collar, fine bubble film and ample spotty lacing. Bright sniff of grapefruit rinds. Full flavor DIPA, loaded with more grapefruit, oranges and resiny grapefruit...delicious, complex and densely flavorful....I enjoyed every sip...go get some and enjoy."

4633,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.63,"Original review was b1....gave it a 4.45. B2 was a huge step up in mouthfeel, sweetness, and overall coconut flavor. Not sure I've ever had a stout that has the same authentic coconut flavor....floaties included."
4634,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.27,"Pours a matte, dark orange color. Completely opaque. Thick full four finger off-white head forms on the top of the beer.  Aroma has notes of orange, mango, a bit of melon, handsome light grassy hop notes.  Taste follows the nose with notes of orange, mango, dried grass, papaya and again, a bit of melon. Moderately sweet and a bit creamy. Light grassy hop bitterness on the back end that lingers into the finish.  Feel is medium bodied, smooth, creamy, with a moderately bitter finish. Moderate carbonation.  Overall a very nice IPA, well executed and flavorful."
4635,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.79,"Can thanks to Joe P. One of my final 8 Top 250 beers (list as of 7/15/2020) L: Pours beautifully with a creamy white head, beer is orangey/yellow S:Citrus, citrus and more citrus. A bit of bite on the back T: Smooth and delicious, great tropical fruit on the tongue that gently goes back to a bit of a piney back end.  M: Light upfront but pushes through to a nice presence that lasts O: Up there with OG Juice Machine as their best IPA, glad to have finally been able to try this one after searching for so long."
4636,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.4,"Poured from a bottle -dark as night with little to no head or lacing. Nose is muted roasty malt ,some sweetness and a whiff of chili. Taste follows more or less with a hint of cocoa and vanilla. Was ready to not be impressed with this but after a few sips I have seen the light -outstanding in a not so subtle way."
4637,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.78,"This beer is throwing me for a loop. Second time I am trying space trace but first time writing a review and it tastes more like FO than a chocolate coconut beer. Pours thick and dark with a good amount of carbonation for the style. Leaves a layer of foam covering the surface of the beer. You get an overwhelming vanilla note on the nose. A little bit of chocolate on the back end and a generally sweet character. Coconut doesn’t really stand out however. The taste is sweet and balanced and follows the nose with chocolate becoming more prevalent as it warms. A touch too carbonated for the style but not overtly so. Another hit from bottle logic. Nice barrel, sweet, balanced and utterly delicious."
4638,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.36,"750 ml bottle at share, courtesy of Toby. Pours out the normal, but nice retention on the head gives it a better look. Aroma is nutty, but a bit too much like flavoring and not real nuts. Still good. Lots of vanilla, chocolate, roasty notes on top of a velvety feel. Really superb, and aged well."
4639,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.53,"January 1st, 2016 - I'm feasting on the 2010 addition of this bottle, and it is a European treat, with a barnyard smell that is appealing even if it is a little feral. It has a rich, fecund, manure scent with horse blanket and soil. At last, after seeing these descriptors attached to wine and cheese and other delicacies I can see why animal poop can be something nice on a beer's bouquet. And the beer surprises again with the first taste, and an incredibly well crafted sourness, with any excessiveness acid trimmed and leaving a brilliant profile. It hints and teases at sweetness, but falls just short, instead offering tartaric tang. Brilliance in a bottle, with a side of horse."
4640,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.64,"Pours an almost entirely opaque brown with tinges of light coming through at the edges, with a big, light tan head that dissipates slowly. Aromas of dark fruits, leather, raisins, slightly dried prunes, fig, caramel, and toffee dominate. Subtle undertones of vanilla, oak, brown sugar, cocoa, and coffee follow. All the immense complexity that one would hope for in an English Barleywine is present, and then there's an extra step above in every aspect! Only a slightly over the top boozy aroma keeps this from being perfect, and even that isn't unwelcome. Truly delightful! The taste is more of the same. Deep complexity, with rich dark fruits, leather, cocoa powder, vanilla, and oak playing the most prominent roles. Toffee and molasses also are big players here, and there's a hint of coffee as well. It has a velvety mouth feel, thick, rich, and coating. It hides the booze well for being 14%, but it still lets you know it's there with a tinge of alcohol burn on the end. This is a world class English barleywine! Incredibly complex while retaining a perfect balance between the aromas and flavors. This is just wonderfully executed, and I hope to be able to drink this many more times in the future!"
4641,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.56,"I was really looking forward to this one. Pours black with a coffee-and - cream colored head. Huge Bourbon on the nose. Toffee, molasses and a little char in the taste. Been holding on to this for a while, woeth the wait."
4642,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,3.81,"What has happened to CBS? The lest few years it has worked it's way to the ""not worth the price"" category. There is no maple flavor any more, the coffee and chocolate are muted, and it's basically a good barrel aged stout."
4643,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.67,"L: Brilliant clear amber brown in color with a light lace. S: Very fragrant, powerful scents of funky sour cherries, grapes and plum.  T: Initial bright refreshing champagne-like start, it’s a split second of silence as your taste buds reset. As you wait for it, a smooth transition of flavors move towards the rear and to the sides of your tongue as your saliva glands get seduced. Flavors of sour cherries, nectarines, kumquats, apricots and plum emerge and give way to more complex flavors of oak, black pepper and tobacco as it stimulates your salivary glands, drying your mouth and making you thirst for more.  F: Medium bodied O: One of the smoothest sours I have ever tasted! People celebrate with champagne, if this bubbled like champagne, this would replace champagne. This is delish! If a sour is a sour, this is a refined sour. This is a well cellared vintage sour ready to drink at its peak!"
4644,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,5.0,"Had at a beer share with 2 good friends a few months ago. We had been trying to acquire this for a long time, we finally tracked it down and it was worth the wait!"
4645,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.41,Look: Mahogany brown with small white head. Has low carbonation.
4646,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.52,"Tasted in a Rastal Teku from a bottle on October 5, 2018. Brewed with a blend of Barrington and Mostra coffee beans. Notes of Fdark espresso, tiramisu, sweet chocolate cake and smooth vanilla. Highly recommended."
4647,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.73,"Blend 2, consumed onsite at Side Project. Juicy apricots with a touch of oak and the signature Side Project yeast/sourness. Looks and smells incredible...very nicely done!"
4648,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.42,"375 ml cork and cage bottle. Served fairly cold into pint glass. 2018/19 vintage with a best before date of late 2038. Cost was $14.25 CDN. One bought to celebrate a house close, the other for some event in the future. Listed at 7.1% ABV. Super stoked to get a couple bottles from this world famous (2nd most famous?) lambic creator. Blend 13. Appearance - Hazy rich coppery gold brew with a small half finger of white head that fizzles out in a minute or two. Even some reddish hues to this brew. Smell - Complex! Starts with hints of balsamic vinegar, but there's a woody and smoky undercurrent. Orange marmalade fits in there. There's a mustiness and something like rich leather. Some earthy barnyard funk fits in there. Other fruits, maybe apricot or peach show vaguely for an instant. A lot going on, but it's like a pleasant journey with the senses rather than an assault. As it warms... something perfumey or floral that I can't quite put my finger on. Taste - hints of vinegar again, orange marmalade with a light smoky flavor. Leather mixed in as well with some sweetness from apricots. A sprinkle of white pepper at the back end and all this wrapped around a slightly musty and earthy body. Kind of surreal with how much is going on. Overall, tart but not overpowering. Mouthfeel - Medium-light bodied, bright expressive carbonation. Booze quotient is invisible until it hits the back of the throat, then you realize there's some booze here. Light tingly sensation. Initially moist but then finishes quite dry. Overall - Wonderful brew, super duper complex. This isn't a style I have tons of experience with nor is it a favorite style, however I can certainly respect and enjoy (some of) the complexities and nuances of this brew. While Gueuzes have always been a complex style full of nuance this Cuvee blended by Armand & Gaston ramps it up to a whole new level."
4649,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.5,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Aroma is sweet, malty and sugary with dried fruit notes. Taste is sweet, boozy, sugary with intense flavors, bitter dark chocolate finish, bourbon heat and wood barrel."
4650,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.63,One of the best NE IPAs I’ve had from trillium. A real bench mark for the style. 
4651,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.64,"Batch 2 bottle. Poured from a 750mL bottle into an Anchorage Teku glass. Thanks Ray for sharing.  Pours a dark brown body with an off white two finger head that reduces rather quickly to leave a ring of retention.  Aromas are sweet and malty, molasses, cognac and toffee dominate. On the tongue its roasty and sweet, butterscotch candy and molasses, bourbon soaked vanilla beans, french vanilla, more vanilla than other barleywines I've tasted which is a nice touch. Aftertaste is toasted malt and sticky dark fruits. Mouthfeel is rich, heavy, low carbonation.  This is drinking lovely right now."
4652,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.14,Pours a hazy dirty straw color with a finger of head. The nose is citrusy. The flavor follows the nose. The bitterness on the finish is modest. There's some nice pithiness but this one is a little shy of epic.
4653,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.43,"Cable car 2014 on 180617 Pours a brighter golden-yellow color with a small, yet stable white head. Offers a mineralic apple sweetness, which gets balanced by old cheese, cellar funk and a lovely hay softness. Atop of this settles lime zest, making this quite sour on the nose, together with lots of old leather and some malt sweetened moldy woodbark. This is definitely more funky than acidic with an unforseen richness of aromas, due to the well enveaved malt sweetness, amping everything else up by a few notches. Unusually full bodied for a sour beer with lots of flavors battering down the palate at the same time, soothed by a mineralic effervescence. This brings a stony quality to the palate, making this highly refreshing, while never loosing its true goal, of creating a multi layered sourness. Yupp this is sour, not your typical AWA in-your-face acidity, but a very well nuanced, matured and balanced tartness. This comes along with blue cheese, dried mushrooms, green apple peel, tangerine pulp and a note of spiced cucumber. After this first impression, the beer settles down a little, allowing sweet wheat and a subtle note of toffee to cut through, enriching but mellowing the omnipotent sourness at the same time. There is even more funk after the swallow, now accompanied by a bright mineralic effervescence, pushing the sourness a bit more into the background, unfolding old cream cheese and dried garden herbs. Finishes almost calm, aqueous with a lingering apple-lemon tartness and soft, sunbathed wheat.  Stunning. This beer wants to get discovered slow and carefully, since it simply needs time to adjust to the offered complexity. It is a very rewarding process though, exhibiting the most perfect unfruited AWA I've had so far. The beer hits every mark you could expect from a world class sour, so sit back and enjoy the ride."
4654,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.46,"Pours a shiny pitch black color. Thick velvety dark mocha colored head dissipates slowly and only partially. A good 1/4 inch of velvety foam remains on the beer. Thick, viscous almost fudgy when poured into the glass.  Aroma has notes of dark roasted malts, tobacco ash, hints of tart raspberry giving way to a warming bourbon and oak aroma. Notes of vanilla, dark fruits and some light earthy pine hop notes.  Taste has notes of dark roasted malts, a light tart fresh raspberry flavor with some piney hoppy notes on the back end. As the beer is consumed you get the bourbon, oak, charred oak and vanilla notes coming through as they warm the palate. the barrel character here is well balanced within the beer profile overall.  Feel is thick, fudgey, and incredibly smooth. Very mild carbonation - just enough to keep it from coming across as still. Semi-dry finish.  Overall this is about as good as a fruited stout can get - absolutely lovely beer."
4655,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.21,"Strong base wood and yeast funk that allows the sweet cherry pie flavors: sweet cherry, vanilla, and acid, to brighten the finish in a rewarding way. Smell is musky funk forward with slight tart cherry, where taste is more balanced and gets the oak-funk interaction more. If you like your krieks really funky, this beer is for you!"
4656,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.85,"Look......super thick coming out of the 750 ml bottle - very dark black - 1 finger head that dissipates quickly - foam ring continues on - reddish hue in the glass - no light gets through this one Smell......rich caramel and burnt sugar - some prune and tobacco - molasses and chocolate - slight hop presence with some floral and pine  Taste......wow!!!! - super rich caramel - chocolate and coffee - burnt wood - charred grains - a bitter bite from the dark roasted items and hops - super powerful and a bit boozy - molasses and sweet syrup come in - really rich, earthy, and woodsy Feel......very thick and full bodied - lower carbonation - still active - oily and syrupy Overall......this is an amazing beer - close to the best RIS I've ever had - so rich and complex - I should always have one of these on hand for special occasions - can't go wrong with this one - Surly is becoming one of my favorite breweries in the country"
4657,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.27,"Foggy burnt red with a soft burnt white collar. Smell is a perfectly excellent expression of seedy raspberry with hints of sticky sweetness and light funkiness. Taste is a little funkier with a lightly sharp raspberry sourness accented by hints of Sweet Tarts and Spree. It's a bit less impressive on the palate than I expected, with a crisp froth and a paper dry finish."
4658,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.5,Tasted on tap at New Bohemia on 2/29/20. Not sure what year this is but had been wanting to try this one for some time and I was not disappointed. Very tasty.
4659,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.96,"L: Beautiful deep cloudy orange with 1 inch of frothy white head. Poured into a tulip glass from a growler, filled @HF the day before.  S: Tropical fruit, but very ripe tropical fruit. I smell guava and passionfruit and mango in there. Very crisp aroma.  T: A very hoppy and hazy DIPA. Mouth-wateringly good. Lots of the same flavor notes in the aroma translate to the taste - mango, ripe navel orange. Towards the end, a bit of a citrus rind and some pine. Just fantastic though - really well balanced and just so clean for a beer of 8% F: Moderate amount of carbonation, extremely luscious. Definitely made me salivate!  O: This is a really fantastic double from HF. It is one of their most common beers and although I have tried a whole variety of their offerings over the years, have never had this one. This is just spectacular - likely my favorite Pale Ale from them and is just a step above all of the other doubles in the VT area at the moment (in my opinion, at least). The aroma of this is very very pleasant and you can go through several glasses without skipping a beat. If you see it, get it!"

4661,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.6,"Enjoyed 6 days after the born on date. Color is a bright amber; opaque, but not hazy. Head fades to a thin white with some slight lacing. Smell is citrus and stone fruits with some dankness. Taste follows with the citrus being more prominent. Medium bodied and smooth across the tongue with a little bitterness that lingers. Very easy drinking for the ABV. Would seek this out again."

4663,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.63,"Amazing how much fruit goes into this beer. Tastes a bit sour, but also sweet with loads of mango, guava, and passion fruit. This was tart, but not too acidic - an amazing balance of flavors. Love the bottle art as well."
4664,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.65,**
4665,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.24,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass. Purple bowling ball (2016 bottle). A: Very dark brown, nicely opaque, with a thin tan head that fades to a ring along the sides. Low visible carbonation. S: Big bourbon up front, with less, but still big, oakiness. As the bourbon punch fades the coconut, vanilla, and chocolate malts show up. Roasted malts, cacao, mild char, and dark roasted coffee. Light tobacco as well. Definitely booze-forward, but yet still not a particularly ""alcoholic"" smell. Really nice here. T: Chocolate and bourbon, vanilla and coconut. Oak tannins and sweetness, with milk chocolate and roasted malts. Some ethanol burn, drying tobacco, and notes of caramel and milder sorghum. Then more coconut. A mild roast bitterness and milder hop bitterness near the end, but ultimately fails to even come close to balancing the sweetness – chocolate with coconut plus the vanilla swells at the end, but some bourbon sweetness ultimately wins out after the swallow. O: A nice thick body for a porter, although this seems like a “porter” in name only. The alcohol is quite prevalent, albeit very well-hidden for anything claiming to be 15%. Low carbonation sensation, but seems fitting for this beer. O: This is quite good. A nice coconut and chocolate and bourbon balance. But it's pretty sweet – and that comes from a guy in Florida used to CCB, Angry Chair, and Cycle stouts. I wish there was just a little more bitterness here – whether from the roast or hops I wouldn’t care. It’s not quite disagreeably cloying, but even splitting the bottle two ways the sweetness is just a little more than I was looking for."
4666,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.54,"Beautiful dark and thick pour, thin tan colored head settles quickly into ring around glass."
4667,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.36,"Beautiful beer. Light, tart and refreshing. Perfect beer for a hot day. Drank this while floating in my pool all afternoon! Made my float more enjoyable!"
4668,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.49,2019 Vintage. L -- Pitch black in the glass with a finger of handsome medium brown head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves a small ring of lacing. This stuff looks very thick
4669,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.99,Nice and dark. Very thick. Very good considering it has not been barrel aged. Coffee and vanilla come through great on the taste. Smell is like a tiramisu with a nice coffee smell. Mouth feel lasts after and tastes excellent.
4670,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.49,"L: Poured from a bottle to a snifter glass. Had a jet black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy, tan-colored head that quickly dissipated. Average lacing. S: A very enticing aroma of apples, wood, chocolate, roasted malt, hops, and toffee. T: Tasted of a mild amount of hops (mostly in the finish), a lot of chocolate (a big component), a bit of toffee (it hangs around the edges), some roasted malt (present throughout), and a lot of the apple brandy (and its barrel). A complex, slightly subtle, well done flavor. It's not as aggressive as Prairie's other stouts, but it's definitely tasty stuff. F: A so-so amount of carbonation with a silky smooth finish. Medium-bodied. O: A wholly enjoyable stout. Drinkable."
4671,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.29,"A lovely beer with excellent apricot notes in the nose. The taste was a little too acidic and didn't have the depth of funk and fruit I would hope for, although it was especially nice as it warmed up"

4674,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.25,Another Trillium winner. Excellent balance in all respects. This brewery does it really well and this has just about everything a drinker would want in a hazy New England IPA. Nice.
4675,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.73,"A: Pours a golden yellow-orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing S: Mostly a mix of tropical fruit and citrus, along with some earthy and piney notes T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of tropical fruit, citrus, and pine. Picks up the earthy notes and a light-moderate bitterness. Earthy notes come in as the pine takes a bit more of a hold. Finishes with lingering citrus and pine M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation O: This is probably one of the most well-rounded and easily drinkable NE-meets-west-coast DIPAs I’ve ever had. A bit more NE with the haze and juice but definitely puts out a WC vibe as well with the pine, earth, and dank. Highly recommend"
4676,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.34,"Sweet pineapple, tropical hoppy, and hint of dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a slightly malty, tropical hoppy bitterness. This might be slightly passed it's ""drink by date"", but is still drinking nice and feels good on the palate!"
4677,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.65,"Picked up fresh from the brewery in December 2019 by a wonderful brother as a Christmas gift. Giving this huge props because it’s a West Coast IPA in a sea of hazy NEIPAs. Clean, fresh, delicious....this was the point of the spear of the beer scene not too long ago."
4678,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.42,"Aroma doesn’t have too much working on it besides your typical citrus funk & dry yeast found in Berliners...taste has lots of bright guava, just the right level of tartness but just a little too much saccharine / sugar on the back palate"
4679,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.63,"It's finally about to happen... Years I've dreamed about this bottle. Years it has eluded me. Now, on my birthday evening, I'm staring face-to-face with Aaron - preparing to crack him open.  I'm ready 2015 Vintage - Bottled May, 2017 - poured into a shifter at 45°F. Pours out with a glug, glug, glug, sitting a ruddy, rusty red-brown hue - cloudy, but does let some light in. A partial loose tan head bubbles, before quickly dissipating to a thin tan collar. 4.5 Nose: As soon as the cap came off, the aroma filled the room. English barleywine to a T. Sweet malt, raisins, toffee, brown sugar, caramel, Werther's Originals, leather, varnish, maple, cherry wood, pecan, maraschino cherries, candied dates, black grape, prune, and a kiss of molasses, all wrapped up into splintery white oak, with a beautiful bourbon presence, lending vanilla, and more caramel. A whisper of roast, some musty old rackhouse, and age. Time. Maturity. 4.5 Palate: Aaron greets the palate with a big sweet hug of toffee, caramel, date, dried fig, dried cherry, raisin, vanilla, plum, pecan, and maple. Rich, decadent, and bold, yet not cloying, as a second wave with oak, bourbon, and tons of dark fruit washes in and cuts into the sweetness. The dark fruit is very prominent, lending a subtle fruity tart kiss, which is crucial to providing balance. A round, malty nuttiness follows, with pecan, walnut, and that almost fatty element to them. The woody oak presence grows, and with it, some malted milk, vanilla creme, and just a dusting of cocoa, before the bourbon finally emerges, flowing into the finish - dry now, with splintery white oak and just a shadow of barrel char.  Mouthfeel/Body: This is near-perfection. Aaron is rich, luscious, smooth, thick, and a bit viscous, yet avoids ever being syrupy, cloying, or overbearing. The oak and dark fruit brightness cut in just enough to thin it out, and the 9% ABV ensures it isn't pure glue, but worlds away from thin. Restrained, but respectable effervescence for the age, size, and style, and finishes with an incredible oaky dryness.  Overall: Aaron is the number one rated English barleywine on BeerAdvocate, and for good reason - however, this goes beyond superficial ratings. Hill Farmstead instills magic in all of their hoppy and farmhouse ales, and Aaron is no exception. It's a beer with an identity, from a brewery with an identity. I'm not sure you could brew a better English barleywine if you tried. Yes, Aaron is hard to get, but if you can get him fairly, you'll be rewarded."
4680,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.69,"Pours black with a finger and a half of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is sweet bourbon over medium-roast, medium-bodied coffee. Toffee and molasses each add a little sweetness, with hearty roasty and toasty malts forming the base. It's all led by sweet bourbon. Flavor profile is bourbon, chocolate, molasses, toffee and medium-roast coffee, with roasty and toasty malts. There is a kiss of char at the back, but otherwise, the heat from the alcohol and bourbon are low. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety texture that is broken up by a hot, grainy texture. Overall, a huge and superb stout wedded with notable bourbon and flavorful coffee.  Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 750mL bottle."
4681,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.36,"Honey/orange, with a foamy white head, and an aroma of oranges, mangos, and pineapple.

Sweet finish with lingering bitterness. m; Medium, good body and lots of carbonation tingle. o; Different and easy drinking stout, rather more porter than stout heft, peanut butter addition clashes somewhat with the base stout malt, but lets the chocolate dominate along with the peanut butter, which remains pleasantly muted but present."

4689,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.64,"2018 batch Much more drinkable right away than last year. The 2017 batch was hop burn overload. This even looks more hazy and fluffy than last year. The smell is amazing. I liken it to Perm 32. Pineapple and mango overload. It smells so incredibly juicy that it could be passed off as a smoothie in look and smell. Taste is great. A lot like 32, but with less sweetness and more hop bite. Loads of tropical fruit, as well as oranges galor. There’s definitely a bite here, but it’s not as overpowering as last year’s batch. Overall really enjoyed this. It’s not topping 32 or even Galaxy Cutting Tiles, but Trillium has been putting out amazing IPAs all year and this is no different."
4690,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.0,"Cloudy golden orange body. Sweet caramel, floral and a touch grassy. Grapefruit and citrus is fairly mild.

4693,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.33,"a classic from these guys that i am only finally getting to drink now. it may have been a game changer when it first came out, but it certainly isnt anything new anymore. this balance of heavy dry hopping over a hazy base with some substance is now everywhere, and even the hop profile itself seems somewhat classic, more northwestern than southern hemisphere, but its the degree of refinement that has me blown away, which is more manifest in the mouthfeel than anywhere else in this now famous ipa. it is both expressively carbonated and bone dry, while also being drinkable but substantial, round medium body but fast finishing, the right elements of the hops linger too, no vegetal bite or over bittered harshness. it does have some bitterness though, not all juice, and the grapefruity piney flavors, almost assuredly simcoe derived, do have some resolution, but its the between the lines nuances of pineapple, papaya, and juniper that turn me on here. so alive from the tap, almost chuggable for what it is, probably ahead of its time when it was introduced, not decidedly in the middle of whats hot, but this is a quality league or two above just about everything else, including the other ones the nerds all line up for and freak out about. from a flavor standpoint, its great but not revolutionary, but through the lens of quality, its as good as it gets!"
4694,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,5.0,I am drinking a bottle brewed in 2008 and packaged in 2010.
4695,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.67,"Citra pours a beautiful amber orange with a soapy and loose, 2-finger, light yellow head that deposits some minimal lacing. The smell is resiny and dank with citrus fruits, a hint of floral and a slight malt sweetness. The taste is initially smooth and sweet over the palette with a dank, hop bitterness from the Citra, giving off flavors of grapefruit, pineapple and a hint of zest. Truly an outstanding DIPA, comparable, maybe better than Pliny the Elder for me. Took nearly 2 years to finally find a can up my way in NoCal and this is an impressive beer!"
4696,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,3.92,Nice looking beer. Thick luscious appeal. It has citrus elements and finishes dry and more bitter than one might expect from its appearance... but i found this to be a rather nondescript ipa... (and then i see its actually a “pale ale”... maybe all pale ales are just “nondescript ipas”?) Nothing outstanding. Nothing that I’d really think twice about. I was shocked to see the score of 99. My can was a month old so Im going to attribute its lackluster appeal to that.
4697,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.5,Bought a crowler if this when I was in NC for a house hunting trip. Moving from CT I was anxious to try the best NC had to offer. It’s almost as good as any NE IPA from the classic stops. Well done Heist!
4698,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.92,"Batch 1 bottle poured in a stemmed bulb. Pours a murky brown color. Minimal head that fades quick. Aromas of dates, raisins, plums, caramel and toffee. Taste is exactly as the aroma. Sweet dark fruits, caramel and toffee just coat the mouth. This is like drinking candy. Absolutely amazing. No booze. Feel is full bodied for the style. Overall, this is an amazing beer. Best barleywine I’ve had to date!"
4699,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,5.0,"L - about time. But wait, what about Hhhazeee? Either way, I've been waiting patiently for an amped-up Haze variant since the dawn of time. Meanwhile Julius and Green are getting every variation under the sun (not that I'm complaining). Let's dig into it. Pours a lovely, glowing orb of mesmerizing mango. Solid color thickness that hits the right shade of burnt orange, getting darker as we move closer to its core. Fluffy, pink-hued white head with tightly-knit bubbles, giving it a cream appearance. Dissipates at a moderate pace, but leaves a thin film of lacing that takes equally long itself to melt down the sides of the glass. S - rich and permeating. Almost warm, much like a liquor might toast your insides, but it's not the booze... it's raw fruit essence. Peach at its core which is fun because it LOOKS like a peach. Mild cereal grains and a tsunami of bubblegum-infused cantaloupe syrup slathered on a ripe mango. Intoxicating aromatics. T - holy shit. I haven't felt this kind of overwhelming flavor waterfall in a long time. Usually there's a split second as the beer hits your lips that you need to start digesting the flavors, but this hits hard and immediately. It's like my lips have taste buds! Saturated doesn't even begin to describe the tropical... meltdown contained in this glass. Flavor density matches the energy density of a nuclear reactor. Peach radiates throughout as this mango cream milkshake releases a massive juice bomb explosion, delicately balanced by tingling grapefruit rind bitterness. The transition is executed so perfectly that you hardly notice the numbness and sheer hop-soaked after effects until you stop to wonder why you can't feel your mouth. Melon, strawberry, kiwi, banana. Nails those guilty-pleasure fruit smoothies that should happen in your life more often, but you know it's a PITA to keep fresh fruit and they're really not as healthy as you rationalize because in order to make them meaningfully healthy, you gotta add stuff that doesn't taste as good. But fuck it, watermelon is rad. Drink up. F - gentle creaminess with physics-defying viscosity that is somehow pungently dense, but also airy and light on its feet to keep you coming back for more. Liquid nectar. Sorry-- nectar always is liquid. Let me try that again. Liquid... beer? Ah- fuck O - getting vibes from all the famous Kings and Very's; this is the epitome of Tree House's IPA efforts so far. Picture King JJJ orangey juiciness plus Very GGG's fruit smoothiness and top it off with that signature grapefruit bite from the Haze line and baby you've got yourself a stew."
4700,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.24,"Pours a deep amber with a cream colored head.  Sour and sharp with notes of leather and tobacco rounded by floral and wood.  Sour, leather, tobacco, up front with notes of citrus & lime. A sharp sour punch, finishes dry and woody"
4701,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.34,"16 oz. can from Brewery (also sampled at Brewery): this one pours a cloudy slightly orange tinted golden color. Minimal head and lacing. The nose is good. A mixture of many hops with none overpowering the other. Tropical, pine, citrus and some floral/herb notes. A little muted from what I expected. The taste is wonderful. A plethora of different hops, all well balanced against one another. Some dank hops, with tropical, pine, citrus and maybe a bit of some herb flavors. Now real sweetness to this, just a bit of a dank hop bite. A really excellent beer."
4702,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.55,"Canned 7/17/18, so a week and a half ago.  A: Pours a light, opaque orange with two fingers of foamy white head. Solid retention and a bit of lacing. S: Candied pineapple, creamy mango, clementine, and white grapefruit. Rich and flavorful! T: Lots of sweet mango and citrus, grass, and a bit of banana and herbs. Finishes with moderate sweetness but still a moderate bitterness, maybe a touch higher than ideal, and a bit muddled on the finish. M: Creamy medium-full body and medium carbonation that cuts the body. O: Very tasty tropica/citrus NE IPA. Among the better in Trillium’s stable."
4703,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.08,"Hazy bronze with a frothy, bubbly light khaki head, Great delivers smoky caramel and toffee with nutty marzipan, splintery oak, and pungent aged orange zest on top of an underlying toasted biscuit, all via a crisp bubbliness and a light but solid heat that rides along some peppery whiskey."
4704,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.83,"Poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter. Look- Sudsy white head, deep gold, hazy, above average lacing, average head retention. Smell- Pine resin, tangerine, peach, mango. Taste- Peach, pineapple, mango, papaya, strong pine resin finish. Feel- Between medium and full body, average carbonation, creamy, very astringent lingering finish, medium bitterness. Overall- Flavors didn’t harmonize as well as I expected."
4705,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.22,"Pours a hazy dirty straw color with over a finger of head. The nose is predominantly dank with some piney notes in the background. The flavor has notes of orange juice and grapefruit juice with a pithiness on the finish. This offering is super juicy but while the finish is hoppy, it simply lacks the bitterness that I expect in a top-shelf DIPA. It's tasty, interesting and worth trying once but I wouldn't make it a repeat purchase."
4706,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.01,"Pours close to jet black with a 0.5"" frothy tan had that recedes to a thick ring throughout the drink. Nose is heavy with dark, chocolatey malts, tannic dark chocolate, black licorice, and cinnamon; maybe touch of maple sweetness as well. Woodsy oak and vanilla notes from the barrel. Taste is pretty spicy - brackish Australian licorice, cinnamon, vanilla, and a significant malt backbone. Alcohol is present and warming, and it does help carry some of the spicier flavors. Apart from the alcohol and vanilla notes, however, I didn't feel I was getting a ton out of the barrel. Mouthfeel is huge and chewy, small amount of carbonation. Overall, it does a great job of carrying the flavors it sets out to feature."
4707,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.65,Bottled 2/18/2018 consumed 2/16/2019  Poured into a Hill Farmstead etched glass L - pours a golden hay color with a 1.5 inch almost white head that dissapates into a nice lace. Not as crisp of color as I expect from some of HF ba saisons 
4708,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.19,Poured out of a can into a tree house pint glass 
4709,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.68,"2017 vintage no. 004 consumed Jan 2 2021. Pours a rich medium mahogany with maybe a 1/2 finger of fast-dissipating foam. no real lacing. I have a bad sense of smell but I picked up raisins, bourbon barrel oak, maybe some other dark fruits. Wife got coconut. Same taste. I really like this a lot but on a cost per ounce basis I'm not sure if it compares favorably at $0.83/ounce with other bourbon barrel-aged beers I really like as much or nearly as much."
4710,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.52,"b4 poured from a 750mL into a snifter. pours a hazy light orange with fluffy white head. smells of oak, lemon, hay, white wine. taste is oaky and dry, lemony tart with a white wine finish. mouthfeel is fluffy, full & well carbonated. overall, amazing saison. definitely needs some time in the bottle."
4711,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,5.0,Lucky enough to grab the last bottle at Brick Store Pub (ATL) for a pretty penny. Worth the money since this is unlike any beer that I have ever had. Unique base brown ale with drying vinous funk of the Pinot noir barrels. I think I prefer Saison Bernice slightly but this is essentially flawless.
4712,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.46,"Appearance: Opaque yellow-orange with a finger's worth of dense white head.  Aroma: Citra citra citra. Very nice.  Flavor: Citra citra and citra again. So delish! Lemon/lime pith, orange skins, grapefruit, pineapple, and guava. Very strong ripe fruit flavor throughout. Bitter on the back end.  Palate/Finish: Creamy but has some carb, easy to drink. Finishes with more ripe grapefruit and dry hops.  Overall: What a great beer. There's so much flavor and I love how it focuses on those bitter citrus fruits rather than being sweet."
4713,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.49,"A: Pours a light pale/blond with a thick two-inch cap of bright white, sudsy foam. Very good clarity and retention. Not gonna lie—it kinda looks like a lager (at least the first pour; subsequent ones were cloudier). S: Light lemon, hay, wet earth and leather, crackery malt, dried jasmine. Appealing and well balanced. T: Follows the nose with lemon, light earthy and leathery funk, green apple, dried flowers, and crackery malt. Long finish with mild malty lemony sweetness and mild tang. M: Medium-light body, medium carbonation. Toeing the line of being crisp. O: Super drinkable refreshing. A well constructed saison that’s perfect for the warmer months."
4714,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.5,"Had this beer on tap at the Mule Bar in Winooski, Vermont, just outside of Burlington. Excellent! Another good one that day that is not listed here was called ""William"" and that was superb also. This is obviously a top class brewery, worth visiting the next time we are up here."
4715,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.31,"A very nice. well-balanced beer. A bit too cloying for my taste but overall one of the better coffee, milk stouts that I've had. Alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. Coffee character is what propels this beer to its heights."
4716,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,3.94,"People are raving about this one apparently, but I’d counter a bit as I’d put this third behind regular Pseudo Sue and the Galaxy version which is my favorite due to a strong affinity for galaxy hops. This is very clean and crisp but more aggressively bitter than the others and some flavor nuance is lost for me. Still obviously very well made and love getting cans less than two weeks old."
4717,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.53,"Translucent medium orange, with one finger of coarse white head, that leaves a thing ring and slight spotty lacing. Looks like fresh-squeezed tangerine juice, minus the pulp. Smell is ....oh!....:>) ....very enticing! Tangerine, sweet red grapefruit, candied papaya, dead-ripe pineapple, a faint bit of mango, and just a hint of fresh bread. Also, bit of pine, green onion, and lime zest from the open can.  Taste is grapefruit pith, orange rind, dried pineapple, persimmon, and a slight bit of green onion. Moderate pleasant bitterness, that lingers awhile, and gives a bit of drying effect on the finish.  Feel is medium, slightly sticky/syrupy, with moderate, soft carbonation.  Overall, just a joy. I'm not completely on-board with the green onion flavor in beer (Amarillo hops?) , in general, but in this case it's a light touch, and works well with the other flavors. I like the bitter/dry finish , as it tempers the sweet, juicy fruity elements. I see why this is so highly recommended . I concur. If you see it, grab it. You (probably) won't be disappointed."
4718,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.65,"Drank on August 8th, 2019 - on a work trip in Boston, the day following my birthday - splurged a bit at the brewery to celebrate. Surprisingly thick pour - nice color- excellent haze, not tremendously carbed. A bit grassy, mango, slightly green and hoppy in the taste. Nose is quite grassy and green as well. It's sweet, but finishes with light dry bitterness. I love that balance "
4719,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.25,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of floral coffee notes with some black chocolate note and some subtle bourbon notes. Taste is a mix of floral coffee notes with light residual sugar notes, some chocolate notes with some bourbon notes with light vanilla notes also perceptible. Body is full with good carbonation and no real apparent alcohol notes. Superb coffee based imperial stout with some light and well-balanced bourbon notes."
4720,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.24,"A: Semi opaque peach, orange pour with pulsating yellow highlights. There’s some retention with miniscule lacing S: Aroma has a musty, grainy-funk barrel presence with apricots, nectarines, lemons, grapes, and bright citrus: slightly vinous, rationally acidic, and moderately juicy  T: A restrained vibrant earthiness of the fresh cut grass, and approachable tartness. The notes sing to jammy apricots, pinot noir, grapes, peach, orange rind, oak, wood, and citrus M: Clean, effervescence, and lively which smoothens out to a sweet, semi-creamy jam: moderate levels of carbonation, with a medium feel and dryness in course O: Balanced and multifaceted with warmth: entertains exploration and stimulation"
4721,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.85,"Pure brownie batter, maybe a little easy on the sugar. All the the ingredients that I could identify were top notch, fresh and blended extremely well, especially the coconut. Not much lacing, but that's not my biggest concern when downing a beer of this style. Best BL beer I've had since FO b1."
4722,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.84,"On-site pour decanted into their branded wine glass. Dregs into a taster glass on the side. Golden straw color, fairly hazy, but not near opaque. Light flows through and brightens the brew. Barely off white head, foamy, settles to ring around the glass. Honey, white wine grapes, floral, slight yeast and funk. Lots of layers in the aroma. Citrus zest in the background. Delicious, the honey is subtle and floral, delicate funk, some earthy and grassy notes. Tartness is present but doesn't overpower or block anything else. Soft carbonation, smooth, moderate mouth-feel. All around excellent brew. What farmhouse/saison brewers should aspire to acheive."
4723,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.51,"Probably my favorite of the Speedway coffee variants. The beer pours a blackish brown color with pretty good head retention and lacing. The beer looks rich and viscous, which ain't no bad thing. On the nose, there is considerable coffee and vanilla, along with underlying dark chocolate and perhaps a hint of cinnamon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, and while this stout is pretty sweet, the coffee flavor seems to balance and counter that sweetness somewhat. There's a mocha quality on the palate of this beer that I just love. Mouthfeel is full, soft and fairly creamy, with a very long finish. Alcohol is incredibly well integrated into the flavor profile, and so drinkability is terrific (almost too terrific, as it's hard to show restraint where this beer is concerned).  Just outstanding, and a beer I would order and even make a special trip to obtain, whenever I see it on tap around Portland (which is pretty infrequent unfortunately)."

4726,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.55,"Bottle is about 2.5 years old.  A: Orange tinted pale with fizzy white head that quickly disappears to nothingness.  S: Funky barnyard and earth alongside a good dose of tart apricot, earth, orange, and light oak.  T: Hay, sour apricot, grainy wheat, a touch of citrus and new oak, and a whiff of tartness that grows to medium-light through the long finish. Sourness is firm but not excessive. The fruit component is noticeable but pretty light at this point.  M: Medium-light body and medium-high carbonation.  O: An excellent fruited sour, one of the better American versions; sort of Fou Foune-ish. Doesn’t quite hit the complexity of the Belgians but it’s still damn good."
4727,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.39,"Pours opaque orange with a frothy white head on top. Good lacing and retention. The smell isn’t over the top but had some nice tropical notes to it along with some subtle dank aromas going on. The taste has a sweet orange-like melon candy with a bitter creamy finish. The feel is smooth, very easy going. Overall another outstanding NEIPA from Tree House."
4728,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.56,"Outstanding golden yellow body, bright and clear; lively carbonation; immensely dense and creamy white head. A beautiful aroma to the beer; biscuit and cracker infused with fruity esters and a subtle herbal spiciness. An incredible mellow sweetness; bread crust; suggestions of mint and white pepper; pine resin; mellow hop bitterness. Medium-heavy body; mildly sticky on the palate; gently sweet., softly warm. What an incredible double IPA! The beer exemplifies balance, depth, and complexity, emphasizing the malt and hops above all. There is minimal alcohol presence in the taste. An absolutely superb DIPA!!"
4729,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.8,This is one of the best BBA Barley wines I have had to date! Nose on this one was amazing right from the start and then the Caramel and Bourbon Barrel notes are awesome. I would love to have more of this ASAP!
4730,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,5.0,"2012  L: Pours a beautiful deep cloudy red S: Smells strongly of cherries, red wine notes and oak T: It tastes like it smells delicious cherries mixed with red wine and oak  F: medium carbonation full bodied very clean dry finish. O: This beer is Fantastic and one of the best I've ever had and it will only get better with age"
4731,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"At the Toppling Goliath new brewery opening. Got a pretty large pour. Dark chocolate, fudge, and bourbon. Overall an amazing beer that I was very fortunate to be able to have."
4732,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.03,Draft pour. Nice amber color. Very fine ivory head and nice lacing. 
4733,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.71,"Bottle of the 2013 split 3 ways at Hill Farmstead. Poured a lightly hazy reddish copper with maybe a finger of white head. This was incredibly delicious. Pleasantly funky, with some green apple, and a bit of acidity. Far too drinkable."
4734,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.99,Decanted from a 25.4 oz (750 ml) bottle into a muffin top taster pint; produced in 2019. Have to thank my friends Elina and Bob for obtaining this for me.
4735,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.41,"Moussy tan over oxblood; confectioners’ sugar, bright cherry, sarsaparilla, toffee, light clove, some banana + a touch of roses; cocoa, big black pepper, bread + butter pudding, marshmallow, prune, sticky toffee, + a bit of a floral end; smooth, moussy, medium.  4.25 4.5 4.5 4.25 4.25 I’m thinking of Westmalle as I drink this, which is the standard bearer + a lovely beer, but this is so much more subtle, nuanced, and complex. You’re just compelled to keep sipping. All the quality. Model of the style."
4736,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.68,"What a beer. I’ll say it again. WHAT A BEER. Gosh I feel like I waited years to finally get my hands on this and it does not disappoint at all, not one bit. This is one of maybe 5 beers I’ve had in my life that I would say not only live up to, but exceed the hype. I don’t even need to say anything besides this. It is a PERFECT example of an old school ipa. Not west coast, not a juice bomb. Candied stone fruits galore. No booziness at all for the abv. Scary drinkable. I’m gonna have another even though I probably shouldn’t at 9%. It’s well worth the cost of admission."
4737,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.85,Look: Dark brown to black with just the slightest head

Look- Between pale and medium gold, mildly hazy, average head retention, above average lacing, white sudsy head. Smell- Pine resin, citrus. Taste- Pine resin, grapefruit. Feel- Between thin and medium body, average carbonation, high bitterness, moderately prickly, sticky lingering pine finish. Overall- Delicious West Coast IPA."
4739,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.51,"On tap at the brewery. Pours black with beige head. Body is full and smooth. Taste is of toasted malt, sherry, dark fruit, brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, alcohol, herbal hops. Long almost dry finish. Delicious brew."
4740,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.18,** Super hazy: 90%. Murky yellow color. Big off white head.
4741,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.61,"First beer I had at Dark Lord Day 2018. Sampled multiple times throughout the course of the day as well. On draft and poured into plastic cups, which were then poured into my glass. Standard Dark Lord body, not much to be said about that. Smell is a massive cinnamon, slight spicy rye, brown sugar, a bit of burnt black coffee, a bit of umami, milk chocolate- recognizably Dark Lord underneath. The flavour is a bit more muddled, but the cinnamon remains huge, from the beginning to the end, contributing that cinnamon toasted crunch up front intermingling with the DL base, and combining well with the spicy rye barrel to bring more of a spice component on the backend. Peppercorns aren't as prominent as in 2017, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is full bodied, good carbonation, smooth and slightly silky, cinnamon spice on the finish. This is on the level of BA Abraxas in terms of the cinnamon, without the green pepper from the spices. I can see this one being the variant of the year."

Aroma and taste are Sublime, smooth light tartness, more if the Brett notes. Right in alignment with the way Russian River does these beers. Well worthy of its reputation"
4745,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.35,"No head retention. Fairly clear and pale, more like a strong ale than stout. Nose is almost all booze and brown sugar. No hint of hazelnuts. Brew is nutty on the palate, especially up front, followed by waves of brown sugar, grapes, dates, chocolate, oak, raisins, bourbon, and lots of boozy heat. Hot, big, boozy, and proud of it. This is a warming sipper that presents its booze well. Like the best, most complex Bruery beers, this is reminiscent of Utopias. I definitely feel it’s more of a strong ale, as I don’t get much of a stout feel to this."
4746,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.38,Haze from Treehouse. Received on 9/4/21 from @Rub_This_BBQ in NBW BIF #13. 12 oz can stored upside-down at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 16/4/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
4747,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.49,"Pours a dark brown color. Tons of nice sweet coffee and cinnamon. Milk and dark chocolate, roasted Malta, cream, and light molasses and maple. Thick body and low carbonation, easy to drink. A great stout; so glad I have several bottles of this."
4748,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,3.64,"Nearly clear bright yellow brew with a thin cap of foam. Robust mouthfeel with super-sized malt. Aroma is mango. Flavors of dark orange, even some grapes. Rich and powerful with hot citrus. Quite alcohol tasting. Boozy, as someone noted. Overall, this is a pretty non-nonsense blast of hops. I have never seen this in the San Diego area, and here it is at a supermarket in San Francisco. From the 22 oz bottle."

Retention is low and there are sparse chunks of sticky lacing left on the glass. Smell is very strong bourbon and sweet milk chocolate, along with some caramel, vanilla and oak. Taste is the same. Starts off with a huge helping of sweet chocolate cake that transitions to the caramel and vanilla mid sip with a bourbon and oak finish. The bourbon flavor is huge, but somehow this beer is in no way boozy. Feel is full side of medium, slick, oily and really coats the whole palate. Carbonation is right on the money. Overall this beer is excellent. The body could be a little more thick, but the booze is so well hidden. The bourbon and chocolate also go together wonderfully. The bourbon adds complexity and cuts through the sweetness of the base beer. Fantastic!"
4756,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.75,Very dark appearance with minimal head. Aroma is a very pleasant slightly sweet bourbon and caramel. Taste is also a slightly sweet bourbon that is a perfect blend with minimal alcohol taste.
4757,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.46,"Original black Tuesday is better to me, but this is better than grey Monday. A great tourist beer, as it takes you on a novel taste journey. Really opens up with a bit of temperature."
4758,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.51,"#248 of Top 250 (as of 3/11/21) thanks to Orca Whale L: Motor oi black, small tan head S: Deep barrel and only a bit of vanilla, which is surprising.  T: Tobacco, vanilla, decent amount of barrel. Good stout with vanilla without the vanilla over taking F: Thick and heavy mouthfeel O: A great, but not perfect BA Vanilla stout, happy ot have finally ticked this one."
4759,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.46,"Consumed April 2017 - Poured a dark, brown color with a small, tan head head. Smelled of brown sugar, dark chocolate, raisins. Taste was so complex. Everything from the aroma plus oak, vanilla and dark fruits."
4760,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.35,"You can smell it from a foot away. Not quite a facsimile for orange juice, but pretty close. This is a Frankenstein hop amalgam. Surprised it has such complexity - a lesser malt base would turn this to a muddled mess. I get lots of different fruits - orange and lime zest give some tang while stone fruits give a nice contrasting unctiousness. It finishes as dry as it can and the body is surprisingly spry for a big beer. Well done, trillium"
4761,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.17,"Deep brown to light black in color with minimal light penetration. Murky river water complexion which is true to barrel aged barleywine. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering a third of the top. The aroma is a plethora of malt, some vanilla, and some bourbon. I taste vanilla, sweet malt, and bourbon. The mouth is sticky, chewy, and boozy."
4762,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,3.64,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/11/21. ‘Be good to each other.’ Amen to that. Served in a spiegelau-style IPA glass. Pours an opaque, dull orange with two-plus fingers of pouffy, lathered foam. Retention is epic, leaving a big puff ball for a cap and a tattered curtain of sticky lacing. Aroma is peachy-yeasty with pineapple, vanilla cupcake, and a hard-to-pin-down hint of something vaguely minty. Taste is pretty much in line with the nose, peach, pineapple and handfuls of green, leafy bitterness. Fairly hot at the finish with an unpleasant, kerosene-like aftertaste. Feel is doughy, fluffy, medium-full bodied and brightly carbonated. There is a building petroleum-like slickness such that, by the end of the glass, I want a cracker to scrape it off my tongue. Overall, I probably could have lived without this. Maybe it’s just because it’s so young - something I’ve never complained about with a TH NEDIPA before - but, at one day old, it was hot, raw and green and took a certain amount of willful ignoring of off-flavours to enjoy as well as I did. At 8.8% abv, it drank like a beer well over 10%."
4763,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,"Appearance - The beer poured with the appearance of orange juice with no pulp and a bubbly white head.  Smell - The nose was composed of orange juice the leaned more bitter than the average hazy.  Taste - Orange rind led the way, which kept the beer from being overly sweet. A spiciness followed that caused a light warming sensation. The overall profile had a nice sense of balance. It was sweet, but not loaded with added junk.  Mouthfeel - The haziness paralleled a thick body. It was not quite drinking juice without pulp, but it was thick.  Overall - This is a great example of the style that is not overdone."
4764,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.5,"Brew: Hair Of The Dog Brewing Company / Brewery And Tasting Room - Matt Intro: 12 oz. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.  Appearance: Dark brown, almost opaque. Minimal to no head. Same with the lacing as we drank Smell: Smoke is what hit me first, then dark fruits. Seems to be a lot going on here but nothing stans out front. Very well blended  Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Again, a mixture of dark fruits, pretty heavy tasting. Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy. Invokes seriousness. You can definitely tell your not drinking an IPA Drink: Again, follows along with mouthfeel. It was heavy and a slow sipping beer. Not something you would want on a hot day after cutting grass Conclusion: I’ve had several other strong ales and this would not be in my top ten. It is very well crafted and is deserving of it’s place in the category. It just gives me the impression of old school."
4765,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.96,HO. REE. FAWK! I absolutely love this brew! So Uber danky and pungent with bright citrus hops. This may well be my favorite “regular” DDH DIPA bomb. Can never get enough!
4766,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.5,"2016 variant drank on 4/2/2016 This is definitely a great beer. Due to the limited number of bottles, the hype and asking price for this probably overrates this thing, but it certainly is excellent. It is probably best after completing warming because the peppers settle down a bit and the maple explodes. The complexity of this is incredible. Notes of cinnamon, peppers, vanilla, cinnamon, coconut, bourbon, sweet dark chocolate, maple, oak, molasses and so on. It's really great"
4767,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.65,Raspberry...funkiness....leathery...dusty....tart...  Truly a masterpiece.... absolutely spectacular beer... nails everything you could ask for in this type of beer...  
4768,Space Trace,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.1%,4.52,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is alert pleasant coco and coconuts. Taste is also a very pleasant smooth coco and coconut.
4769,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.25,"Picked-up a single bottle at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton for $12. My ninety ninth brew from these guys. Brew # 3 in TH stout day (off this week). Pretty good, a bit $teep.."
4770,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.06,"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with no dates. Served in a Sensorik glass. Appearance: The one finger head goes away fairly quickly and dissolves into a thin foam layer. It leaves big patches of lacing all over the glass. It's a pure black color. Smell: It smells strongly of coconut with more subdued (but still prevalent) notes of ground coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malt. Taste: The taste is really well balanced. On the sweet end there's coconut, milk chocolate and brown sugar. The bitterness comes in at the end with some black coffee and roasted malt. Mouthfeel: It's robust enough, but not super heavy which is good because it keeps the sweetness from getting cloying. It's smooth and creamy with low carbonation. Overall: The coconut is a bit overwhelming on the nose, but everything is well balanced and executed on the palate. Despite the heavy body, it's not really that strong or cloying which makes it quite easy to drink as well."
4771,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.71,2016 Vintage poured into a teku: Cloudy straw-yellow slightly orange pour with small head and constant champagne like carb bubbles rising
4772,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.55,"750ml bottle poured into a snifter A- pours a deep brown color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that has good retention before settling into a ring around the glass S- aroma opens with a heavy mocha cream notes from the combination of lactose and and cocoa, as well as an earthy espresso note that adds a bit of cracked pepper. Sweet maple, vanilla cream and rich chocolate. The close adds spiced notes of cinnamon and pepper skin, as well as more rich mocha espresso to close it out T- earthy and peppery coffee notes up front are immediately complimented by sweet notes of whipping cream, caramel and rich maple. Mid-palate starts to develop a rich dark chocolate mocha flavor that carries into a finish that brings out cinnamon and pepper, with the pepper providing just a hint of heat. Lingers of espresso, heavy cream and chocolate M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a silky, velvety warming finish  O- all of the adjuncts work harmoniously with the milk sugars providing a perfect mouthfeel, outstanding"
4773,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.73,"B2 Bottle at Fermier Day Pours a ruby red berry juice with thin pinkish head that dissipates quickly. Nose is bright juicy strawberries, raspberries, cherries. Gettin some dry tannins and oak. Taste is straight fruit juice, raspberry jam. Overall, this knocks it out. Not overly complex, straight fruit juice, but that's not really a knock. Delicious."
4774,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,3.8,"650 mL bottle. Pours deep brown. Smells of coconut all over. Coconut and nutty malts. Bourbon. Tons of booze. Tastes of coconut. Nutty malts, bourbon, oak. Lots of sugar. Heavy, sweet, boozy. Everything wrong with beer is happening here, but it's tasty."
4775,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.17,"Sparkling clear yellow-gold with a tall bright white foam settling to a persistent blanket with a slight cling at the edges. Smell is hay, straw, wild herbs and orchard fruits with a touch of toasted oak and a hint of lime rind. Taste is grassy hay, lemon and apple, with more brett forward funk and bitterness than regular. Tart and crisp with a tingly semi-dry swallow, a touch of woodiness comes out on the exhale. Overall very well balanced and extremely drinkable. This isn't the drastic transformation from the base that other barrel aged Hill saisons are, and it's barely more tart. Considering Dorothy is a stellar beer in its own right, I'm still very satisfied with this sip of sunlight on this uncharacteristically sunny Northeast Ohio day."
4776,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.7,One rating down due to supply and demand. No distribution but in-house consumption only. I managed to be one of the luckiest to be able to take one home. Best one so far.
4777,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.79,L: Pours a thick onyx and mocha stream with a 1cm sandy head and moderate lacing
4778,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.5,"I am nagging a little bit, because I think this beer deserves a better rating than a 4.5. I am a bit spoiled though and I am wondering if the cellar period influenced my rating. Nevertheless I do think this beer is worth looking for."
4779,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.29,"FFBL draft. Found this to be super boozy. Not a ton of vanilla either. Smelled great, taste wasn’t as impressive. Thick mouthfeel. Overall, solid but not as good as its rating."
4780,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.18,"Tremendous imperial IPA from the very solid Pipeworks. 5/11/20 date printed on can. Pours a very slightly hazy darker yellow-orange color with some fluffy white head and small rings of lingering lacing. Big aromas of ripe grapefruit, mango, orange, lemon, pineapple and also some malt, vanilla, weaker floral hops and faint piney hops. Taste follows the nose, excellent flavor and balance, good depth, higher ABV was fairly well hidden although there was definitely a little warming alcohol as the beer warmed. Smooth crisp mild mouthfeel, a little sticky, somewhat soft, great carbonation. Well done!"
4781,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.23,"There's some subtle differences between this and the base beer. First, it's muddier in appearance. Second, the nose is more earthy and not as brightly citrusy. Finally, the body seems heartier and the malt has a stronger backbone. The plusses and minuses equal a push in my book."
4782,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.11,"Canned 7/10/20 This was one of the ones I already had on the first night of getting the mixed case, but I really wasn’t thinking much of it as I drank it idly so I wasn’t impressed. Let’s see how it performs under a watchful eye Pours a hazy, opaque pale yellow with 4 (!!) fingers of soapy white head that fades very slowly and leaves tons of lacing As much as this looks like hazy pineapple juice, it smells like it too. Tart pineapple, sweet blood orange, banana, and papaya. Lighter notes of pepper and citrusy hops Very juicy on the front end of the sip, with plenty of creamy peach, orange rind, and melon. Mid palate brings more creamy and sweet tropical flavors. I get a hint of coconut milk backed by citrusy hops. The aftertaste is long and sweet, with smooth caramel malt and banana Full bodied with very mild soft carbonation, this feels heavy, but certainly not 8.2% heavy. Finishes sweet and a bit sticky This was much better than the one can I already had (which was borderline warm) and makes for a damn solid IPA. I don’t think it quite reaches the levels of the average rating, but it’s good stuff regardless"
4783,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.58,"Pours a burnt orange color with a thick white head that dissipates some throughout drinking. Solid lacing on the glass. Nice tropical smell on the nose with some of the nelson character as well. Taste reflects that soft citrus flavor with nice bitterness shining through. Great, smooth mouthfeel that you look for with the upper echelon IPA class. Best IPA offering from these guys in my opinion"
4784,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.73,Very dark appearance with nice tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a slightly sweet cinnamon and bourbon. Taste is a very pleasant cinnamon and bourbon.
4785,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.49,"Effervescent gold, fluffy cap that settles into a persistent lace. Aroma has soft lemon peel, hibiscus, light loam, wet oak. Palate is features Brett tart upfront, more lacto sourness towards the back, distinct chardonnay note that really sets it apart. Undertones of oak, dry farmhouse yeast, citrus. Very good, maybe a smidge too lactic but love the chardonnay notes."
4786,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.54,"Theres just something about trillium beers and this one is not exception. They call it a Pale and that's definitely up for debate. But whats not up for debate, is the notation that this is a world class brew! Because it is! The Galaxy dry hop on this beer gives it an extra does of that New Zealand Spiciness while at the same time delivering distinct tropical notes and trillium's yeast strain helps to add a dry snappy finish. It's an amazing beer worthy of your seeking."
4787,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.66,Finally was able to track this one down thanks to good beer friends! Definitely one of Alpines best! Nice citrus notes and a solid hoppy finish. Enjoyed the 64 oz growler with friends at a Bachelor party share.
4788,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.9,"Batch 4, bottled 5/21/2015.  Appearance - Pours a pale straw yellow that is slightly opaque, but you can vaguely see through it. It's golden hue resembles more a glass of Chardonnay than beer, but the narrow, dense, snow-white head gives it away. What the head lacks in height it more than makes up for in retention, as it never fully dissipates; even when it finally sinks, it coats nearly the entire surface with a thin film of foam.Bubbles of carbonation lackadaisically rise to the surface every now then, but they are sparse. Aroma - The aroma is a blend of fresh-cut grass, lemon peel, nectarines, subtle graininess, and finally a burst of white grapes at the end. It is altogether cohesive and summons and subtle tartness that ties everything together. The fruitiness of it makes it infinitely refreshing to smell, and the acidity coupled with the almost tropical-like fruit blend is nearly flawless in execution. The barrel is integrated seamlessly, with waves of oak, vanilla, and finally the wine itself washing over the other notes without overpowering them. Taste - After my first sip, I was surprised at how acidic Art actually is compared to what I perceived in the aroma; to be fair, in contrast to other beers it isn't overly acidic, but it came across more than I expected. After a few more tries to acclimate, it's easier to swallow. The grape-lemon zest combo is still king and why not, since it is so good? Lemongrass and the grains come next to light the load, before finally the fruits emerge again to carry this to the finish. The tartness kicks the flavors up to a whole new level. The wine is a bit more present here and it contributes a slight booziness that oozes into the other flavors to give them that barrel-kissed feeling. The vanilla falls away here, leaving the oak to drive home the barrel notes. Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is probably the only thing I can fault Art on, in my opinion. I was expecting more carbonation based on the style, but it falls pretty low on spectrum, and a bit more would've made this even better. Otherwise, this is very nice. It is light on the palate and is just dry enough to make it super refreshing.  Closing Arguments - As my first foray into Hill Farmstead's barrel-aged program, and really, to the brewery itself (I've never really tried many of their beers even though they are always on my radar ever since I had Ephraim way back in early 2011), I didn't know what to expect with Art. Happily, I can easily proclaim this is near the top, if not the top, of my saison list. It is flawless in almost every way besides the carbonation, and I could drink this endlessly - especially in the summer heat."

4790,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.5,"2015 vintage from a 375 ml bottle at Himmeriget in Copenhagen. I've been wanting to try this one for a long time and this was the first one I went for off the amazing lambic list at Himmeriget. Super balanced, not too sour, and just so nice to drink. Lives up to its reputation."
4791,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.5,"Tremendously boozy vanilla in the nose and in the taste. Lots and lots of barrel - a bit dry, nice clean finish. Vanilla tastes very natural, though boozy as hell. Call me a heathen, but I prefer how much smoother Fundamental Observation is (2017 is my benchmark) - I might almost rather have that beer."
4792,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.21,"Vanilla definitely takes the forefront on the nose, with a little bit of woodiness, as taste adds toasted double chocolate chip cookie with sweet vanilla glaze. A very mild bourbon heat and viscous, syrupy thick body finishes sticky, semi-dry. The after taste is total s'mores Oh hey, #4000!"
4793,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.56,"It’s about time I had this. Alpine ""from Alpine."" Had on tap at the Toronado. Hazy. Tart. Light aroma. Alpine Nelson hops. White wine grape. Tart green sting on the finish. Delicious!"
4794,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.46,"Draft @ 7 Monks in Traverse City A - Pours pitch black with a one finger tan head. Tons of soapy lacing.  S - Aroma is coffee and roasted malts. T - The taste is huge black coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate & dark fruits. M - Full body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish. O - This is definitely lives up to the hype. Coffee for days. Dangerously drinkable at 12% abv."
4795,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.74,"2014 bottle poured into a stemmed tulip at the brewery. Pours a clear gold color with substantial head that dissipates quick. Aroma is lemongrass, subtle vinegar, hay and funk. Taste is all that and then some...very balanced. Some lemon acidity and funk is prominent. Very nice! Feel is what I’d expect for this style of beer. Overall, this is a magnificent and elegant brew. So deliciously tart and also balanced."
4796,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.84,This may be the best beverage I've ever tasted! Velvet on the tongue. Dank on the nose. Smooth down the gullet. Hoppy in all over the previous. LOVE IT!!
4797,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.59,"L: Hazy yellow/orange with a foamy white head that dissipates and leaves good lacing. S: Candied citrus, orange, peach, and lightly toasted malt. T: Mellow bitterness, but heavily resinous flavors of orange, grapefruit, peach, and mango. The malt comes in with some notes of bread and honey. F: Medium bodied and dry, good carb and a creamy mouthfeel. Overall: An insanely juicy and drinkable DIPA. Very well executed and definitely worth seeking out."
4798,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.73,Very cloudy straw color with minimal white head. Aroma is a very prominent grapefruit that is very smooth. Taste is also a prominent grapefruit that is tangy and very nice
4799,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.5,"Pours opaque dark gold color, like pineapple juice, with a 3 finger soapy biscuit head. This is a seriously good looking beer. Aroma has rich, sweet citrus and mango notes. The flavor is strong with orange, pineapple and mango notes. It is a clean, dense taste that hangs in until the end. There is a touch of earthiness as it warms up The feel is very soft, heavy and substantial with low bitterness and a lot of effervescence, tingling the tongue well after the finish."
4800,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.49,Pours a mostly clear straw yellow with a thin white head that disappeared quickly.
4801,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.83,I have no idea why but this tastes like a lightly toasted Marshmallow. So good and so not what I expected it to taste like. A must have beer for any stout lover and worthy of its acclaim.
4802,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,5.0,"I had the great fortune of sharing a bottle of Flora Plum with a close friend when visiting Cape Cod in the summer of 2018. Quite possibly the best sour I've had. Beautiful color and such delicate flavors, worth the money (which was substantial, I think this was the most expensive glass of beer I've been lucky enough to enjoy), truly spectacular."
4803,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.75,"2011 version (Abacus before it was changed to Sucaba). Sipped from a snifter 9/15/2020. This has aged extremely well. The typical toffee, molasses and caramel blend for this beer. A favorite."
4804,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.44,"Look- Hazy orange. Slight translucency with a nice creamy head Smell- Nice citrus tone. Best part about this beer Taste- it's good. Has a nice piney, resiny flavor with slight citrus tones. Falls flat though for how highly ranked it is Feel- Nice creaminess for a pale Overall- it's a nice Pale. It's not a top 100 beer though. Had a Mosaic Dry Hopped PseudoSue immediately afterwards and it crushed this"

4806,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.63,"Poured from a can (08Dec2020) into a Teku L: pours an opaque not creamy darker yellow orange with a very thick and dense white head. Slowly fades leaving very chunky lacing, nice foam on top of the beer ~30 minutes post pour S: great fruit-forward note with piney hop bitterness to match. Avoids being overly sweet despite the quite tropical aroma, mix of mango/peach/melon with that more west coast piney bitterness adding some complexity T: follows the nose well, with a mix of tropical flavors with a slightly piney/citrusy bitterness. Get that mango/peach/melon flavor from the nose, fully and slightly sweet but far from cloying. That bitterness follows quickly and carries through the medium/long finish. It’s just so easy to follow one sip with the next it’s amazing - doesn’t get old, feel heavy, get sweet F: medium body, medium carbonation, smooth, very easy to drink O: amazing DIPA, reminds me of the waves of flavor and easy drinking nature of HT (with less bitterness, of course)"
4807,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.29,"Met expectations almost exactly. Lovely flavors, but a touch artificially sweet. Not much character to it, but it goes deep on that chocolate cake flavor, so it winds up being rather enjoyable. Worth buying if you see it, not really worth seeking out."
4808,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.48,"Pours near-black with a mocha head.  The nose and taste resemble Morning Bell with less coffee and some cinnamon toast crunch and smokiness. Very drinkable for the ABV. The mouthfeel is medium. Overall, this wasn't as mind-blowing as I expected it to be but it's still a 9+/10. I prefer Sunday Brunch."
4809,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.68,"Very nice aroma and blend of hops, remarkably smooth for a 9%. The higher alcohol content is not very noticeable, but can be noticeable if you let it warm up, so definitely drink it chilled. This is probably my favorite IPA by Alpine with bad boy a close second."
4810,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.21,"750ML bottle, 2020 vintage, poured into a tulip glass at 55 degrees F:"
4811,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.23,"375 at Hoppin Frog for $13++ during HH. Pitch dark, thick ring. Nice dark roast nose with some nuttiness, a bit stale though. Great flavors, but wayyy too thin. Chocolate and dark fruit dominate and chocolate lingers. Still, not quite fudgey like I want. A tad over rated imo."
4812,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.35,"Shared bottle at Akkurat in Stockholm. Pours a deep red with soft, pink foam. Smell is funky and vinous, with notes of red grapes, raspberries and a hint of manure. Taste is sour and dry, vinous and funky with notes of grapes, grapes skins, lemon and a dash of vinegar. Very balanced acidity, and drinks as much as red wine as lambic. Mouthfeel is thin to medium, dry and well carbonated. Overall, a great lambic, a gateway between beer and wine."
4813,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,3.74,"A 22 fl. oz. bomber, 2018 release. Poured into a snifter glass. Appearance: Dark dark brown in colour with a thin brown head that dissipated quickly, but left some spotty lacing. Aroma: Roasted malts, coconut, chocolate, vanilla and molasses with hints of oak and bourbon. Taste: Roasty, moderate sweetness, bourbon, chocolate, coconut, vanilla, oak, a touch of booze and hints of molasses. Mouthfeel: Creamy, full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall: Nice sipper, but it got too sweet as it became warmer. I easily preferred Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb which I thought was near perfect, over this version."
4814,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.92,"2018 batch, canned 10/10/18. This is in the top 3 barleywines that I've ever had. This pours a dark brownish color, with some gold flecks, with a small head, and not much lacing. This smells like charred oak, maple, chocolate, bittersweet caramel, tobacco, oak spice, vanilla, Rolos, molasses, and some warming booze. This is so complex and dynamic. It almost feels like barleywine concentrate, and the flavors are super intense but well balanced with one another. The barrel character is dynamite, with lots of spice, an almost herbal character, tobacco, black pepper, and vanilla. The base is already good, but has come a long way with the extended barrelling, with maple dripping all over it, creamy caramel, milk chocolate, Rolos candy, and raisins. This has some boozy warmth, but it's nowhere near as boozy as it could have been. It's a slow sipper, mainly because you don't want your pour of it to end. It's hard to find anything negative to say about this. This is entirely on par with legends like Aaron, A Deal With The Devil Double Oak, and Blue Ridge. This is as good as it gets for barleywines and barrels. I need more of this, now."
4815,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.64,"2018-11 bomber opened slightly chilled. Poured hard to a tulip, which after tasting, should really be a chalice. Aroma of vanilla and caramel can be smelled two feet from the glass! Color is mahogany / chestnut brown, with a two-finger tan head that burns down to a tiny ring with scant lacing. First sips are full of vanilla, caramel, oak barrel, malty barley. The bourbon is very subtle but stays present for awhile. As it warms, there’s a bit more bourbon bite up front and darker malt on the back...not cocoa type of malt. Slightly warming. Mouthfeel is medium, perhaps a little thinner than Id like, but overall very nice. Five more on a shelf, so we’ll see how time affects them. BWIL! Cracked another bomber at the 1.25 year mark. The nose became more subdued at a distance, but still pulls in caramel and roasty char with the schozzola in the glass. Very dark burnt caramel color. No head. Very still when resting, but does kick up some carbonation on a swirl. Flavors are all still there. The mouthfeel has improved to what I like more, i.e., thick, syrupy, heavy oomph that aligns with the ABV. Some dark pitted fruit on the back brings more balance to the caramel sweetness. Still an excellent beverage!"
4816,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.07,"2020 vintage. Tan head that quickly dissipated. Very minimal nose beyond roasty stout. Opens with heavy tobacco, leather, char, dark chocolate flavor. Barrel and bourbon notes very subtle, but round out the roasted malts to make this an easy drinking ba stout. Body was quite thin as well though and that took away some of the flavor impact."
4817,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.69,"2019 vintage, 13.2% ABV, 56 IBU, purchased form the cooler at Firestone in September and refrigerated until now (about 5-6 weeks later) poured into 2 snifters from a 12 oz bottle. Off-black color, about 1/8 inch or less of head. virtually no lacing. Wonderful roasted grain and coffee smell, but not as intense as some others like this style. Taste follows the brewer's description quite well. Most excellent mouthfeel; very smooth and viscous. Overall one excellent beer marred only by the hefty pricetag of $10/12oz and I prefer a little more head retention and a little more coffee-forward smell, which I admit is totally subjective."
4818,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.5,2020 vintage. Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter.
4819,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.48,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 10/29/20, so a little over 6 weeks old. Looks spectacular in the glass. Slightly hazy yellow with hints of amber body. Small white head persists in good form throughout, impressive given the abv. The lacing is simply superb, thick rings throughout. Strong aroma of tropical fruit. On tasting, well, the name certainly fits the beer. A strong bitter grapefruit peel assault on the mouth. But here's the thing. The malt base is also very strong, giving a sweet fruity wash that ebbs and flows with the grapefruit. Loving this. Mouth very close to full. The finish is somehow the exact opposite of the taste, a slight sweet fruity hit followed by a lasting dry grapefruit bitterness. Overall, just an outstanding and complex old school double ipa. Happy to have grabbed a 4-pack, sorry not to have grabbed 2 or 3"
4820,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.81,"Pours and unclear golden straw color, with fine, fizzy head. Smell is tart and citrusy with hints of funk and mineral, along with lemon peel and a little bit of grass. Taste is bright and citrusy, mainly Seville oranges and lemon. Hints of funk, champagne, some minerals and just a perfect acidity. Sourness and acidity are both strong, but never overpowering or mouthpuckering. Complexity is sublime. Mouthfeel is thin and sparkling, very champagne-like. Overall, an absolute world class gueuze. Perfectly balanced and so deep and complex without being intimidating."
4821,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.65,"2009 vintage. 750mL bottle poured into an oversize wine glass.  Pours a hazy maroon body with a light pink head. Aromas are bursting with blueberries and typical cantillon funkiness. Vinous, citrusy, woody, musty.  On the tongue was tart blueberries and fruit skins, barnyard funk and yeasty, musty basement. Oaky, jammy, tannic, citrus, lactic, lively, acidic.  Tons of flavor here, the fruit held up great over 9 years."
4822,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.45,"Haven't done a review in a while. Stepped away from alcohol for a good month and feel great. Anyway let's get into it.  Bottled 1/6/21. This one almost has three months on it. Not optimal but circumstance dictates. Appearance is an almost opaque pale yellow with a mild orange hue. Not much foam formation. A half of a finger of quickly fading white foam. Some particulate shows up the more I pour this out.  Nose is potent. It could just be me not raising a glass to my nose for a month. But grass, pine, ripe pineapple, mango and orange/citrus explodes out of the glass. This smells great. Huge amounts of fruit with a bitter green counterpoint. Taste is different from the nose. The bitterness is stronger than one would believe. Like pine and grapefruit right up front, followed by the tropical notes, and something that reminds me of watermelon that's close to the rind. The bitterness starts out strong and lingers as well. Resinous and piney with milder fruit notes. This isn't as friendly or forgiving as normal King Sue, but reminding me more of Permanent Funeral. Aggressive and bold. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild to medium carbonation. Surprisingly this has held it carbonation quite well. Bubbly and a little sharp.  This is a departure from what people would expect from King Sue, but nonetheless a vibrant brew for serious hop heads. This brings it to a totally different level. A great brew to come back to."
4823,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.73,"VSOJ 2018 can, consumed in 2020. Excellent representation of the style, this pours a deep dark amber color with minimal foam. Caramel, toffee, vanilla all really comes out with a strong barrel presence, which isn't boozy somehow. It's a terrific representation of an English Barleywine. This was enjoyed right after Anabasis (blend 4), and although that came off more robust in flavor, it was also more 'stouty' than VSOJ."
4824,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.5,"Pours a hazy orange color with a thick white colored head with some lacing down the glass. Smells fruity, big melon, grapefruit, and orange aromas. Tastes big and juicy, mainly grapefruit and melon notes with a hint of orange at the end, The aftertaste is a bit tart, feel is medium bodied, perfect amount of carbonation, slight warming at the end. Overall a really good beer, very good take on the NEIPA style."
4825,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,3.99,From tasting notes 12/21/18
4826,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.5,"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for about twenty dollars. Very solid brew, one of my favorite from these guys, would buy again."
4827,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.5,2018 edition poured from a bottle into a snifter
4828,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.79,L: Pours a dark gold with a nice head that stays around a bit.
4829,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.25,"Picked-up a single can at Tree House Brewery in Charlton for $8.05. My fifty eighth brew from these guys. Very fine beer, pinging a bit due to extremely high cost."
4830,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.25,This well made and drinkable Bissel Brothers offering is very close to a world class beer. It is certainly one of the best of its kind but doesn't make that 100 point threshold in my opinion - too many others just too similar.
4831,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.28,"Pours a silky ink black with almost no head. Aroma hits hard with the chili pepper, spice, some coffee grounds and a vague vanilla oak. The palate is very muscular upfront with burnt coffee & seared pepper, it is a little overwhelming - once you power through that initial onslaught there is some cinnamon, coconut husk, rum booziness to add layers. Ultimately it is a beer with a lot of depth but those top notes are just a tad bullying, especially the chili pepper. Thicky and fudgy mouthfeel."
4832,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.84,"'13 vintage (yellow wax) Pours like SR71 b1 thick 5W-30 motor-oil viscosity. Upfront chocolate fudge, with a hint of black licorice and bourbon. Mouthfeel coats the tongue and teeth after each sip, 9/10 viscosity level. Absolutely amazing beer if it was drank fresh or properly cellared. This was drank early May of 2019."
4833,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.92,Excellent annual brew from RRBC. Has a clear fresh look and hoppy aroma with a surprisingly smooth and light taste for a Triple IPA. Stood in line for 4.5 hours with my wife at the downtown brewery on Valentine Day and then for 1.5 hours the next day with some friends. It was definitely worth it each time. Recommend making the trip to the brewery for some “Younger“ if you’re an IPA fan.
4834,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.5,"Pours midnight black with some slight burnt umber highlights and a tan head.  Smells of apple, wood, earth, plumb, raisin, wine, oak, currant, grape.  Flavors follow nose : it is incredibly tasty and complex. Awesome beer."
4835,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.6,Poured on 10/15 from a can dated 10/11 into a Spiegelau IPA glass 
4836,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.59,Canned on Aug/09.
4837,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.54,Look - black thick with a great tan foam and lacing
4838,Double Galaxy,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.52,"From a 12oz can, dated 06/23/20. Served in a willi becher. Pours an opaque mucky orange with two-plus fingers of lush, lathery, cream colored foam. Retention is excellent slowly settling into a big lumpy cap with a tattered curtain of thick lacing. The nose is sharp and clean, pungent, fruity yeast. Pineapple and hard candies.  Taste is juicy-sticky-fruity but with surprisingly assertive bitterness. Pineapple and mango, a sour peach skins-sort-of-grassy taste, yeasted bread roll and mineral water. The sour peach skin/grassy thing persists into the aftertaste. Feel is smooth and juicy, starts sticky but finishes clean, medium bodied with perfect carbonation. There is a mild, understated boozy warmth going down which is wholly appropriate to the style. Overall, probably pretty close to the perfect NEDIPA. The mildly sour, grassy, underripe peach skin aftertaste is the only (very) minor complaint I have and was easily corrected for by taking the next sip."
4839,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.29,"Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of beige around the rim and just a trace of it showing elsewhere. The aroma is of coconut and bourbon. I’m tasting an amazing melange of coconut, coffe, and bourbon. The mouth is oily, dry, and viscous."
4840,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.23,"From a bottle dated 9/12/19 (served at 68 degree room temp). L - A very dense 1"" head of dark brown foam along with a sleek dark brown to black body. The look evokes staring into the abyss which seems on brand for this beer. S - Notes of brown sugar, molasses, and alcohol are most obvious. Other sweet notes dance around as well. T - Taste is quite sweet up front (more of the brown sugar) before transitioning towards alcohol flavors in the middle range (including bourbon notes) and ends with a more molasses/chocolate flavor. F - Feel is heavy, heavy, heavy but at times almost creamy. The high ABV is also evident throughout and lingers well into the aftertaste. O - The beer lives up to its name! Heavy, dark, and drinkable -- it will catch up to you quickly."
4841,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.96,"Batch #2 from a 750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar. Black & Wild has one of the most complex flavor profiles of any beer I have ever had. Sourness, tart cherries, and vanilla and oak from the whiskey barrel are balanced perfectly. Just incredible."
4842,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.09,**
4843,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.92,If I could have this as my morning coffee every day I would. The smell is fantastic along with the rich coffee flavor. The only bad part is every other coffee beer you tasted after having this will never compare.
4844,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.39,"750mL growler from the brewery. Pours a hazy place golden orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Sharp aroma of white grapes, white wine, green apple and weed. Herbal hop notes as well. First sip is white wine, green apple, herbal hops and weed. A bit peppery. Some doughy malts. White wine and grassy, herbal hop finish. Medium body with a slightly dry mouthfeel. Great showcase for Nelson Sauvin hops."
4845,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.0,2019-10-31
4846,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.6,"Blend 3, 375 ml bottle, drank out of a Hill Farmstead tulip wine glass on January 21, 2001.  Poured clear gold with a nice white head that settled out with a little white head remaining around the edges. Smelled tart and slightly acidy. Taste was the same but not as in your face as I had expected (this was my first Side Project beer). Mouthfeel was about right with the medium pucker and quench. Really enjoyed this - reminded me someway of Fou Foune even though that one is apricots. Cheers!"
4847,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.67,Very darknappearance with minimal head. Aroma is a bourbon and coffee blend that has perfect balance. Taste is a slightly sweet molasses bourbon and coffee blend that is exceptional
4848,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,5.0,Super amazing barrel-aged stout with a number of great adjuncts all in one. Each of the adjunct flavors shine through in the low carb semi-thick beer. Definitely try to get your hands on one!
4849,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.63,I tasted this at the brewery Jan 7 2020. I also had Term oil Maple Cakes and Assassin Vanilla bean in the same flight. I have had it other times when that was the best beer in the flight while those other two dominated this. 
4850,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.31,"Thanks to Show for sharing this. A: Pours a dark brown, near black color. A one finger white head forms and sticks around as a cap, light lace."
4851,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.96,"750 into a fff teku l- looks great, thick and black. nice half inch head s- aroma is off the charts! great vanilla and chocolate! vanilla never smelling artificial t- oh shit this is for real. huge bourbon and vanilla, mixes together extremely well. interpreting of the vanilla really makes this beer f- great mouthfeel, smooth and soft. thick and immense but surprisingly velvet o- this is a long time want. i don’t think this is worth the asking price but it’s a must have on all stout lovers. reminds me a lot of FO batch 2"
4852,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.64,"Bottle shared by Curran on my wedding day- thanks a ton man. This pours a hazy orange-ish color, with a small head, and a bit of lacing. Smells like tart and super juicy plum, with lots of oak, a little bit of citrusy funk, and plum skin. This is absolutely delicious. There's so much wonderful barrel oakiness that permeates everything. This is very very tart, and pretty sour, with lots of citrusy and typical HF like funk, and also lots of fleshy and juicy plum. It's hard to find fault with this one. This is lighter bodied, with a crisp, juicy mouthfeel, and a nice lingering sourness. Awesome, awesome stuff, and one of Hill Farmstead's definite best entries."
4853,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.42,"Pours a very turbid, brownish orange color. Big, fluffy off-white head that really stuck around, and clung to the sides of the glass like Belgian lace as I drank it. Not the bright, orange juice color I prefer in my IPAs.. a bit ugly. The aromas coming from the beer is like sticking your face into a container of orange sherbet. It’s hit you with a ton of fruity, sugary, citrusy hops, whiffs of freshly sliced pineapple rings and bubble gum. Damn, this beer is pillowy soft. For nearly 9%, I just cruised through all 16 oz. Flavor follows the nose, and it’s just a fruit bomb. Kiwi, passionfruit, fresh cuties and what I imagine the juice at the bottom of a can of fruit cocktail tastes like.. not like I would ever drink that disgusting shit. Somehow it sounds appetizing in a can of beer, though. This beer is delicious. Mouthfeel is deadly smooth, and absolutely no bitterness or hop burn.. even for an IPA this fresh. Got a bit watery as it warmed, but not bad. Overall, might not be entirely worth the $50 a can people are trying to charge (I didn’t pay that, nor would I be that idiotic), but it’s a really good DIPA, and worthy of being my 100th Tree House beer."
4854,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.21,"Golden orange haze, a great fluffy foam head. A lot of citrus and dark berry, juicy and bitter. Soft, medium body. Pretty hoppy and lends a nice buzz, worth a try."
4855,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.09,"Tracked down a few singles of this one while on the Panhandle. This one was 2 months old, into a wine (cab?) glass that could almost work as a tulip. Pours a beautiful turbid golden orange, good 1 finger head, good retention and lacing. Nose is serious citrus fruit and maybe a little tropical, candied citrus peel, and a little orange blossom or something else flowery. Taste doesn't quite live up to the high bar set by the nose, but it is still great, though a little sugary to be ideal for me. Mouthful is full, a little soapy, and pleasantly lively with a soft but substantial bitterness. A little burn from the alcohol, too.  As neipa-approachable as this one is, you also kind of know you’re dealing with a beast. Wasn’t surprised to look after enjoying one on consecutive nights and see the ibus and the abv."
4856,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.25,"On tap at CBC 2016. Pale golden with a thin white head. Apricot, brett, some citrus and fruit sourness. A good sour beer, but not as good as the hype surrounding it."
4857,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.54,"On tap Toronado SD, into a chalice.  Straw-yellow in color, slightly hazy with a small wispy head, dissapating quickly. Nose is of lemons and unripe berries, touch of funky oak. Flavors follow, if not slightly more fruit-forward, with a hint of cherry sweetness midsip. Quick, crisp, tart finish with lingering notes of sour apple.  Kinda of a legendary brew here in CA, I remember tasting this at the Firestone Invitational some years ago, nice to be able to do a proper review."
4858,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.85,"Look- a hazy yellow-orange Smell- a wave of citrus, orange, tangerine, guava, grapefruit. Taste- superb, one of the best DIPAs I’ve had in a long time. Follows the nose, finish is light and refreshing. Feel- medium body  Overall- a delightful DIPA, would not hesitate to purchase again."
4859,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.77,"This is a dandy! I am a big fan of this style and this is the first time I have tried a Ten Fidy by Oskar Blues. It was part of a Christmas treasure trove of beers from my wife and mother in law. Merry Christmas to me! It has great foamy head retention and it pours an inky viscous black. The flavors blend beautifully, and although the bourbon alcohol flavor is prominent, it isn't overpowering and allows the other flavors to shine through. This is a really well crafted stout and I will be adding it to my list of favorites. Well done OB!"
4860,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,4.65,2011 version. Had a 4 oz pour at the brewery.
4861,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,3.17,16 oz. can. Somehow I've never had this or maybe just never reviewed it. Pitch black with an ample mocha head. Looks nice. Smells of coffee and associated acidity. Sharp sweetness. Lots of roasted malt. Tastes of lactose first and primarily. Sweet and sharp lactose sweetness. Coffee immediately behind it. Milk chocolate. Finishes with some lingering roastiness and lactose. Medium heavy. Very sweet. Sharp and sweet lactose are too much for me. Coffee and intense roast character are overshadowed by the lactose.
4862,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.0,"2018 vintage; drank 3/24/19 @ the Yarchives.  Opaque dark brown appearance.  A violent pour yielded a small tan head; minimal lace.  Caramel, oak & faint tobacco notes in the nose.  Thick, sticky mouthfeel.  Burnt caramel & acorn flavors up front; fresh tobacco, mild oak & faint bourbon notes on the finish.  An earthy old ale; nice flavors here, and easy to enjoy. I'd have another!"
4863,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.49,"2018 release - 12 oz bottle picked up in Vegas at Total Wine L - Brown, no finger or head, but creamy looking. Very enticing S - Sugar cane and booze...smells delicious T - Like the aroma, lots of sugar and some heavy alcohol kick. Perfectly smooth and tasty F - Medium body and creamy O - An excellent barleywine - going to be hard to beat this one. Well done"
4864,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.64,"Had on tap. Very bubble clear yellow body with plenty of white bubbles, just like Anna. Smell takes the citrus, honey, botanical, and funk and gives it a seamless yet expressive backbone of oak, wine, and must. Peach, white grape, apricot, and hay are now all found in the smell and taste. Taste has more grass and botanicals in it, but impeccably balanced. Want a touch more from the barrel to match the honey more, but I am being picky. Feel is bright, delicate, elevated, wild, and slightly vinous."
4865,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.63,Pours black with two fingers of khaki head.
4866,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.84,"Vintage Oct 16 2018 Pours a beautifully opaque dark chocolate color. With a firm pour, the head emerges and is mocha colored. Beautiful lacing as well.  Aroma is filled with dark fruits and raisins. Bourbon attacks the cilia as well as a slight smokiness. Figs and plums, chocolate and coffee. Wonderful aroma.  The alcohol certainly hits but it isn’t hot by any means. The bourbon backdrop is perfect! Comes in hot but fades easily to allow coffee and a significant tobacco flavor to emerge. Lots of bitter dark chocolate. Sublime.  A wonderful beer and one I am privileged to have. Truly one to seek out, even at $10 a bottle."
4867,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.51,"Vicinity pours a light, straw yellow with a bit of murk from the flaked wheat. No real head (old can?) or lacing present. The smell is big citrus with orange, grapefruit and pineapple with a hint of mango. The taste has a medium body over the palette with pineapple and a hint of grapefruit, slightly bitter finished with some alcohol."
4868,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.69,"Poured into a tulip glass via bottle Color is rusty mocha brown Smell is cinnamon and coffee Taste is coffee up front followed next by the cinnamon and a slight chili burn..just enough to make its presence felt Low carbonation Mouthfeel is creamy and light Another exceptional porter from Kane, and perhaps my favorite"
4869,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.55,"Not sure this should be classified as beer, just saying. 2019 version poured from the really cool bottle into a 4oz. tasting glass - looks like a tiny glass of amaretto.Nose is boozy sweetness. Taste is complicated by the booziness, maybe an exponentially intensified flavor profile. Yeah ,that's it. 20+ years of aging and blending. There is nothing to compare this to."
4870,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.75,"A fantastic big hoppy IPA that is surprisingly easy to drink. Feels like a bigger version of Hoppy Birthday, this beer was a wonderful treat to share among friends."
4871,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.68,"Pours thick to a teku, nearly-opaque dark brown with ruby highlights. Half a finger of head, with a persistent thick dusting that lingers around the rim and is revitalized by swirling. Redolent on the nose, vanilla and brown sugar with bourbon spice on top. Plum, tobacco, and raisin join the fray on the palate. Delicate, richly textured and complex, with a lot of barrel character lurking. Tremendous on every dimension."
4872,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.3,"16oz can dated 7/14/21. Pours milky gold with an inch of dense white. Plenty of smeared lacing with persistent retention. Dank and tropical in the nose but far from pungent. Pear, peach, pineapple, white grapes, and faint weed. Medium bodied with a soft but tacky mouthfeel. Grapefruit, unripe peach, grape, and candied orange on the palate. Finishes with a firm bitterness, balancing malt, and plenty of resinous hops."
4873,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.94,"Tasted from can. Pours a cloudy yellow with nice fluffy white head. Aroma is big time tropical fruits. Lots of pineapple, mango, papaya and a hint of pine. Moderately bitter. Hides ABV extremely well. Huge tropical fruit flavor taste similar to aroma with some dank notes. Top notch imperial ipa."
4874,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.22,"I unfortunately can't get down with 100% Citra IPAs much anymore (with the exception of Double Citra from HF - drool) - the overpowering qualities of cat pee dominate here; good to try though, and a great body for what it is."
4875,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.3,"Canned on 10/9/18 Pours a bright, deeply hazy orange with over a finger of semi-thick, pillowy white head; decent retention with fair bits of lacing trickling around the glass. Aromas of creamy orange, candied pineapple, melon, bits of fresh grass and light, plush herbal tones; the citrus punch to this bouquet is level, pointedly hoppy, and incredibly enjoyable and easy to nose. Taste is juicy orange, apricot, peach, guava, faint grass, light hops, and a delicate malty sweetness; consistent profile packed with citrus, tropical, hoppy, and slightly creamy notes all in the right places. Mouthfeel brings slight creaminess, a balanced carbonation, and an excellent, bigger body that betrays itself coolly with a consistent softness on the palate throughout; light bitterness from the mid-palate to the finish adds a refreshing hop prickle.  Excellent example of balance in a NEIPA. Everything is on point, with a consistency never neglecting flavor while still maintaining a calm synchronicity with a varied mouthfeel. Never overwhelming, and the type of NEIPA I could drink repeatedly. Very well-done."
4876,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.6,Looks hazy orange with a white head. Lots of peach and oak in the flavor. Good balance of tart and sweet - loaded with peach. One of the best sour's I've had.
4877,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.59,"This is the Ghost Rider (a rollercoaster here at Knott’s Berry Farm) of beers for Raul. Bought a $20 bottle of 2018 vintage last month, but it gushed like hell so I drain poured it because of “infection.” Well, today I saw this 2020 edition for $12.99 and I decided “What the hell?” because it seemed like a goddamn sign and a good deal! (not that Raul is into that celestial stuff or whatever). Anyway, this one gushed too (but not as bad as the 2018. Oh well, I guess I’ll still drink it). Damn thing pours a bright orange like Lawrence of Arabia riding by camel into the sun’s anvil. Then when I take a sniff, dang sucker is hella pungent on the peaches like a Kim K emoji. Taste is pretty damn good too. Smooth peach essence like that baseball team in that girl movie (Gina Davis did look pretty good).  Anyway, I’m into it and stuff like that hot goth girl in high school that always hung by her locker during nutrition. But then again, it’s exactly that: an enigma. Why the hell is this beer rated so high, yet Logsdon can’t give me a non gusher?  Raul is done with them. Peace!"
4878,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.36,"The beer pours a nice creamy brown head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a delicious looking dark brown chocolate with a nice texture to it. It looks nice. The smell is good. It has a powerful coconut and vanilla creamy smell that it is still amazingly good even after having been bottled after a while. The taste is good. It has the same creamy vanilla and coconut notes with a nice coffee and chocolate in the finish. The feel is good. It's a bit thin and creamy but still medium bodied. Overall, a delicious and pretty good porter worth getting."
4879,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.33,"Dark pour, no head. Copious amounts of coconut on the nose. Tasted shortly after BA Aurox Cocoa/Coconut (which I thought had too much carbo) and thought the Medianoche was a bit flat. Maybe making BA beers isn't as easy as I thought? Overall, it's a nice BA coconut stout but I have other favorites."
4880,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,5.0,"Had this stout at Angry Chair on 3/20/21 so I’m guessing it’s a 2021 bottle. A very nice guy sitting at the table next to me offered a pour from a bottle he was sharing with a friend to my wife. Needless to say, I drank her pour. Jet black color with a little bit of foam. Smells like chocolate with some light bourbon notes. Taste is the best chocolate I’ve ever tasted in a stout. Rich, sweet chocolate balanced perfectly with a slight bourbon taste. Mouthfeel was also perfect just coating the tongue. This beer blew me away! I’ve had the non BA Version years ago and it was very good but this is in a league of its own. The best pastry stout I’ve ever had. The first perfect score I’ve ever given on beer advocate."

4882,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.5,On tap at Three Penny in Montpelier  Delicious and robust offering from Hill Farmstead that reflects their 'older school' approach to an NEIPA -- big citrus and pine notes that fly off the palate with only a light astringent bitterness on the tail end 90/100
4883,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.58,"2017 vintage.  A: Pours black with a cap of espresso-like tan head that recedes to a razor-thin ring. Pretty good retention for the sparse head that’s there. S: Dark roast coffee, a bit of baker’s spice, a good kick of dark chocolate and vanilla, with a light bourbon accent providing additional complexity. T: Rich, decadent coffee and medium-light bourbon and oak, along with a backbone of very dark chocolate, roastiness cut through by a bit of vanilla bean. Somewhat dry, which is accentuated by the hefty coffee presence.  M: Velvety, rounded medium-full body despite prickly, medium-light carbonation. Light alcohol heat. O: A big, delicious, coffee-forward bourbon barrel stout with enough barrel presence to keep things interesting. I suspect that with a little more age, the coffee will mellow and the barrel will show even more—not necessarily for the better, just a different expression. Reminds me a lot of BA Speedway Stout."
4884,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.47,"October 16th, 2015 - This 2014 Cable Car is nothing short of a work of art. A gorgeous rich blonde color, the experience starts with the aroma. Oh sweet, heavily ambrosia. Real vanilla and custard on the top, followed by a ginger note, then braised pear. The bouquet continues with clove, all-spice and a dash of saffron, and finally a cooling aroma of oatmeal. The flavor definitely distinguishes this beer as a sour ale, but the balance between acidity and other flavors is masterful. A long saffron taste pairs with the sourness and is followed by a lemon zest aftertaste. Between sips my mouth warmths with the taste of shortbread, but that breaks with each sip as well, as muscat grape cleanses the palate to make way for each new round of the complex flavors. Truly an exceptional brew."
4885,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.31,"Everything's just peachy at the Side Project brewhouse when the brewery takes their Missouri raised fruit and embellishes a Brussels' styled sour ale. Aided with chardonnay barrels, the character of this sour ale simply keeps building. Fuzzy comes with a slightly peach stained gold color. Hazy with suspended microflora and a touch of wheat, the beer's light froth casts a sour scent over the senses. Sour peach, white wine, citrus, oak spice, sea air and an earthy drift of saddle leather captivate the nose while tepid sweetness teases the early palate with sourdough, light candy and whole wheat. Sweetness is short and easily dissolves once it hits the middle palate. Meanwhile the sourness gains steam and brings an underlying taste of lime, lemon, crabapple, gooseberry and sour white grapes to the tastebuds. Its piquant sourness is laced with white pepper, oak and a abrasive spice of acetone and rice wine vinegar. Dry hay and grapefruit peels decorate the finish while the overcast of peach and nectarine encompasses the entire session. Light in body, the beer's bracing acidity easily strips the thirst from the palate and replaces it with a crisp peach flavor and a puckering sourness that quickly dispels in a peppery, briny and oaken aftertaste."
4886,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,5.0,09/01/17 full TG lineup tasting. This was always going to be the highlight but it did not disappoint. Hands down the best vanilla beer ever made and top 3 overall.
4887,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.5,"2013 vintage; drank 2/4/17 @ Golgi Apparatus.  Opaque pink/purple appearance.  Minimal off-white head; no lace.  Tart plum, mineral water, raspberry & faint marshmallow notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Raspberry, dark cherry & marshmallow flavors up front; tart plum notes on the finish.  Delicious, interesting & overall top notch."
4888,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.68,"Poured from a can dated 2 days ago (fresh!) into a tulip glass. Pours an opaque pale orange/yellow color (like white grapefruit juice) with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention. Scents of sweet tropical punch and candy. I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV. My first time trying heavy mettle (I’ve had one in the alloy series and death mettle) and I think this one is my fav of the bunch. May not be your bag if you don’t like the sweetness that this recipe invokes, but I’m definitely digging it."
4889,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.0,I had this on draft at HF in Oct of 2015. I just found this on some notes I had made. I am putting in some review numbers so I can keep a list on BeerA so I can find what I have had at HF. So this rating really doesn’t count if you read this.
4890,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.25,"Pours a hazy (no duh) straw color with two fingers of head. The nose has plenty of sharp citrus notes. The flavor profile has pithy citrus, some pepper and piney resin on the finish."
4891,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.4,"poured from a 16oz can into a willi becher pint glass. look is a murky orange with bright white head. smell is muted hops and tropical fruits. taste is dank hops along with the muted tropical fruit flavors. it’s pours beautifully but it’s a bit tame, muted, possibly even a bit off. feel is excellent. lower carbonation and full. this would be a world-class pale ale if not for the ‘off-ness’ of the aromas and flavor. and it’s not so much off as it is toned down. perhaps that’s an APA vs. an IPA/DIPA where they are trying to give it more drinkability. i say let those flavors shine but it’s still a very solid beer."
4892,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.71,"Really impressed, but not as nutty as I expected. Dark and opaque with small tan head. Rich nose with heat in the nose, bourbon, reasons and sweet malt. The taste is very complex with molasses, Brown sugar, dates, raisins, oak,bourbon and just a hint of nuts."
4893,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.15,"Pint can of Focal Banger served, as is my preference, in a pint glass. Appears to be dated 04/01/21. Pours thick murky yellow and forms a nice thick head. Aroma is a bit yeasty. Fruity aroma is not too potent to my nose, but there's some lemon and passionfruit juice. Flavor is a completely different level, with pineapple and tropical punch blasting through a bitter, hoppy backdrop which is unmistakably an IPA. Where this beer really excels is that it is both a juicy NE IPA and an American IPA at the same time, compromising on neither. I'm tasting this side by side with the more famous Heady Topper, which I recall not liking quite as much when I first tasted them side by side in, I believe, 2017. Heady is a bit clearer in my glass and it might have a slightly better hop aroma. But the combination of flavors and balance of Focal Banger is just so much more impressive to my palate that it will always be the better beer in my opinion. And at 7% vs. 8% the difference between single and double seems pretty dubious to me -- though for sure Heady Topper tastes more like a double. I'd love to taste this side by side against the best NE IPAs I've had from PNW breweries including Gigantic, Hopworks (Totally Chill), Reuben's (Hazealicious), and Breakside."
4894,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.67,"In my opinion, the least acidic, most fruit forward of the Side Project 375ml bottles. For me, it was also the easiest to drink, along with Blancs. Tons of mildly tart blackberries, with lots of blackberry skin noticeable throughout the beer. The oak presence is very noticeable with a hint of red wine. This was a fantastic."
4895,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,2.03,"750ml corked bottle from the LCBO, served from the fridge. Best before date: 02/07/2020"
4896,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.0,"Had on tap at Toronado for the 25th Anniversary Party. Pour is hazy grapefruit red with white head an pink hue. Nose is light acetic, sour cherry, hints of lacto, and faint cheese with light sawdust. Taste is brighter, cherry is decent but a bit pitty, nice cherry juice quality and fairly sour without being acetic. A touch dry with lighter carb and a prickly finish. Lacks funk of traditional lambic but not bad."
4897,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.41,"750ml bottle poured into a snifter A- pours deep black in color with a one-finger creamy khaki head that has good retention S- coconut is strong on the nose, as well as a heavy dose of chocolate & caramel, light coffee undertones T- taste follows the nose with equal amounts of caramel, coconut & chocolate, followed by undertones of vanilla cake & icing, heavy cream, toffee & roast. Sweet linger that extends the caramel and coconut M- medium body and low carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that turns into a velvety finish that hides the alcohol well O- an outstanding dessert beer that brings out all of the adjuncts but doesn't become cloying, very good"
4898,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.67,"Back as pitch with a thin and light tan head, wonderfully rich coffee on the nose, less bourbon than typical for the brewery but still added to the otherwise simplistic brew. This is in my top two or three for certain though as what it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in execution and refinement!"
4899,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.59,"From bottle at brewery. Beautiful Ruby appearance with a dense pale pink head that retains and laces far better than I've ever seen for the style. Smells like cherry pie filling. Flavors strike a wonderful balance between a gentle graininess, tart cherry, and bretty funkiness. Amazing complexity with a nice drying finish that tapers off quickly. Pricey but understandably so  92/100"
4900,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.6,"Slick, viscous motor oil black with a thin, fizzy mocha blanket that settles to a thin ring. Smell still has that classic Huna cinnamon-chili pepper combo, with chocolate syrup and roasted nuts, but there is a sweet, maple-esque bourbon presence mildly running with it, as a touch more heat burns the nostrils. On the palate, cinnamon and chilies are mellowed out behind an almost milky yet charred oak presence that allows dark chocolate to come more forward before a more peppery, spicy bourbon emerges, that again, has a maple-like influence to it. Notes of coconut and vanilla also come through, even before it warms. It's quite a surprising improvement over an already special beer, particularly because of the less potent pepper presence. This still has a viscous, velvety body with a crisp moderate fizz and a sticky, semi-dry finish, now featuring a more boozy, instead of peppery, burn."
4901,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.12,"Tasted from bottle. Pours a bright ruby red with pink head. Nice fruit aroma. Berries and passionfruit nose. Taste is super tart with sweet fruity flavors. Don’t remember what dragonfruit tastes like. I get lots of berries, strawberries, with some tropical fruit notes. I’m not a huge Berliner or sour fan but this is very nice."
4902,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.2,"A 12 fl. oz. bottle, 2015 vintage, poured into a snifter glass. Appearance: Dark brown in colour with pretty much no head and only sparse to no lacing. Aroma: Dark malt, chocolate, roast, caramel, oak, whiskey, with light notes of vanilla and dark fruit, plum, prunes. Taste: Moderately sweet, dark malt, roasty, caramel, chocolate, oak, whiskey, light vanilla, dark fruit, grape, plum, prunes, some nutty notes, boozy, with light peppery spice. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall: Despite it being both sweet and boozy (usually not my thing), it was still an enjoyable sipper."
4903,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.14,"Dark maroon to purple with a short mauve head that loudly fizzles out to nothing quickly. Taste is super juicy blackberry, to the point of gummies, while dark oak and tannins come in mid-palate, capping off with only the faintest hint of nutty funk in the exhale. Thicket is really puckering and tingly, yet somehow not painfully acidic at all. A playful effervescence runs thru the medium body coming to a just semi-dry finish.  Blend #2"
4904,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.08,"A. Super hazy, fluffy looking orange color with some darker caramel notes. 2 finger fizzy white head that fades quick S: mango, guava, melon, passionfruit fruit, pineapple, caramel, sweet dough, biscuits, candied apricots. A touch of sweet lemons citrus as well T: guava, melon, apricot, and some green hop burn upfront. Grapefruit, sweet malts, clementines, and cantaloupe behind that. A touch of floral hops in here as well with a hint of residual earthy bitterness  M: medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. Not quite as fluffy as I would have imagined, but that’s ok - this is a Pale Ale O: pretty decent offering. Sweet, but just enough bitterness to make this slightly refreshing, which a Pale Ale should be to me. Not mind-blowing, but something that isn’t offensive either"
4905,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.38,"Deep brown in color with a very murky complexion. There's a fingernail of beige around the rim. I'm smelling tart cherries, either Merlot or Cabernet, and just a suggestion of the sweet bourbon. I'm tasting massively tart cherries, Merlot, and a touch of bourbon. The mouth is very viscous and smooth, which is very unique for a wild ale."
4906,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.5,"Season 17|18 Blend No. 53 - drank July 8th, 2019. This was the very first bottle I've seen someone sabre, in the flesh. It was terrifying. Quite pungently sour and tart, plenty of cherry, lots of oak. Very funky."
4907,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,3.78,**
4908,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.03,"This one pours with a very clear light orange hue, with a small head and not much lacing. This smells like funky cognac, sour peach, acidity/vinegar, and a sort of mineral funk. This is one of the more acidic de Garde beers I've had- it's bracingly sour, with the peaches adding a big additional tartness. The cognac adds a touch of funky sweetness to tone down the acidity a bit, but it doesn't cut it a whole lot. There's a prickly mineral finish a bit too. This is light bodied, with a prickly and highly sour mouthfeel- with that feeling lingering long after each sip. This feels a touch raw, but it's definitely tasty."
4909,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.71,"poured from a 750mL bottle into an oversized snifter. pours a hazy and bubbly orange with fluffy bright white head, which eventually dissipates leaving a nice foam collar around the glass. some off-white swirls remain throughout the pour. smells of fresh sliced apricot, oak, wine and a hint of vanilla. it’s all there and combines for an amazing aroma but the fruit is the star here. the barrels give it more complexity than it would have otherwise but it’s very fruit forward. taste is basically dominated by fruit, however, the barrel characteristics are more noticeable than on the nose. it’s sour but it’s also refreshing. borders on light and heavy as it starts off lighter, simple and more refreshing but gets heavier and more complex as it lingers on the tongue and finishes. feel is smooth and full with an oaky dryness on the finish. overall, this is my favorite fruited fermier as i feel like apricot works so well with sour beer. the combination of the base beer along with red wine barrels and apricots is exquisite. this one probably doesn’t show the balance that some of the other fruited fermiers have (Pêche and Kriek come to mind) but i don’t mind that at all as this allows the apricots to shine with just enough backup from the extended-aged base SdF."
4910,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.08,"It looks absolutely divine in the glass. Glowing orange cloudy yellow. Tropical fruit with a dank back end. Taste follows the nose and is somewhat dry with a dank back end. A touch too dank and bitter for my taste. It feels somewhat heavy. Monkish definitely makes good juice bombs but after having a few different ones, I can’t help but feel they are a tad too dank and a touch too bitter. A west coast style New England ipa."
4911,Haze,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.1,"(16 oz can, 04/08/21; purchased at TH by my brother; kept stored away cold till today... poured in stages into Trillium fat tulip) L: opaque, milky, pale, orange-amber liquid; relatively tight, cottony foam cloud perched atop, lasting a good while... steady, messy, thin cap, thin collar, and a few streaky rings of lace S: floral-angled, fresh-cut orange flesh (peel, pith, and meat, yet to be juiced); melange of tropical dried fruit essence (papaya, mango, maybe some passion fruit and/or soursop)... hint of creamy cereal oats in the back; soft, perfumy note of booze, but no overt ethanol presence T: remarkably rolled-off, subdued fruity hop character; unclear, 'hazy' expression... bitter-leaning orange, mellow papaya, maybe even a note of lime hull... I didn't think 'peach' until I read the can, but yes a subtle hint of that too... the least 'sweet' of the TH hazies I've tried... whisper of peppery spice... even the malt/oat character is relatively clipped F: incredibly smooth, from a booze standpoint, its edge its warmth rolled off antique lo-fi... mellow bite and flare of bitterness up front, which quickly fans out, washes away... the alcohol gradually, gently stuns the tongue; stealth... tapered on the edges O: the least treble-y explosive, flavor-wise, of the TH I've tried, but still maintains a certain characterful depth in hop layers... was this an early experimental attempt that they just kept brewing for some reason? (1766)"
4912,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.29,"Yeeeeeah... look wise this is a joke. Looks like a watery 4% beer with giant bubbled head from an aggressively poured bud light. Seriously disappointing. Smells exaclt like straight jacket so I don't know how to rate this. Straight jacket smells great. But for a beer that's 5 times the cost id expect a little more ""yes, omg, or damn"" to hit me when I smell it. Taste - haha... alright you win revolution.  Feel - fucking hot. Not mad about that but damn it drinks like black tuesday. Overall - ungodly hot and unworldly complex. I'll Crack another and give it a real review in the upcoming few months"
4913,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.43,"05/2017 edition poured at Toronado S.D. Pours a super clear straw color with no lacing and soda-like carbonation.  Aroma is of pure wine barrels and lactic acid. Lots of citrus and lactic acid.  Taste is familiar for a sour, but the barrel character sets this beer apart. Lots of dry white wine character and a slight lingering bitterness with some crushed aspirin notes. Overall, this is a good American sour with ample barrel character. I see this pairing a pairing well with a tender roasted pork dish. It gets a 89/100."
4914,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,3.82,"Canned 9/23/20. Poured at 56 degrees. Ruby/dark brown pour with clarity under rocky dark tan head; some cap retention leaves a middling sized island of micro dots and a thin ring; no lace, no legs. Strong roast coffee nose with a whiff of coconut behind. Roast!, espresso, burnt brown sugar; coconut on backend. Light body, moderate minus carbonation; bitter roast bite on tip of tongue. Overall, this is a C+ coffee porter; it feels thin, and the taste is good and roasty until I get to the off artificial flavor/linger; whenever I see “made with natural flavors” on the label, I am wary..."
4915,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,5.0,"Smell: Straight Fudge. Big Milk chocolate, dark chocolate. Fresh roasted espresso beans, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, oak, a little pop of dark fruit. This is just a straight chocolate bomb mixed with coffee and barrel. This beer smells like a chocolate paradise. Taste: Right upfront I get a good amount of dark fruit and dark cherry. Raisin, plum, dark cherry juice. The mid palette the beer just becomes a massive chocolate, coffee, fudge bomb. Melted milk chocolate, rich fudgie brownie batter, dark chocolate covered espresso beans. The finish I get a barrel presence but it isn’t huge. I get a nice vanilla and coconut sweetness with a touch of sweet smooth bourbon and a woody, oaky bitterness to give this beer a balance to counter the sweetness. Feel: The mouthfeel on this beer is absurd. Full and thick. Chewy, but super Creamy and velvety. This beer coats every inch of your mouth and tongue and never lets go. Just an absolutely perfect mouthfeel. Overall: This is an easy 100/100 beer. A perfect use of coffee and barrel. This is a beer you need to sip on to truly enjoy everything that this has to offer. What an amazing first beer to have from side project."
4916,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,5.0,"Never wrote my review for this. Got a chance to sample on Monday, March 2nd following a Pliny event locally. Enjoyed it so much I ordered another, and had a third the next day."
4917,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.65,"A 375ml corked and caged but unlabelled bottle at 3 Fonteinen lambik-O-droom. 2010 vintage, bottled on 8th March 2010. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass. Appearance: A hazy dark orange colour with a just under two finger puffy white head that had good retention and left some nice sticky lacing. Aroma: Funk, barnyard, hay, earthy, citrusy lemon, oak with hints of herbal and green apple. Taste: Tart, funky, hay, lemon, grapefruit rind, wet oak and hints of green apple. Mouthfeel: Smooth, light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Overall: Just wonderful, with great aromas and taste continuing after 8 years in the bottle."
4918,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.42,"2018 Vintage.  Appearance: Pitch black with almost no head, but what's there is dark khaki.  Aroma: The cinnamon comes through, surprisingly given the year. Other, more typical, notes arise such as dark malt and some barrel.  Flavor: Cinnamon, licorice, and chocolate all come through in a harmonious way. So awesome that the adjuncts haven't faded. Best of all is that the cinnamon is not overpowering, it's just there to be noticed. There's a strong bourbon presence that tapers all of it off and lingers around. I get some dark cherry as well or maybe a sweet vermouth flavor in the background. Definitely a s'mores type thing overall.  Palate/Finish: Great thickness - oily, viscous, but fluffy. Finishes with cinnamon, licorice, and barrel.  Overall: Awesome beer. Honestly it doesn't completely blow my socks off like I thought it would, but it's damn close. Wonderfully balanced, great mouth feel, and great flavors coming through. If I weren't spoiled by the adjunct-heavy barrel aged stout train, I could see this being one of my tops."
4919,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.75,17/18 season Pours a hazy cherry color with a slight head and lacing
4920,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.6,"2014 bottle poured in a stemmed bulb. Pours brownish red in color. Minimal head that fades quick. Aromas of dates, raisins, plums and booze. Taste is exactly as the aroma. Sweet dark fruits that hit the tongue on the front. Some booze burn. Finish doesn’t linger. Feel is medium bodied for the style. Overall, this is an amazing beer. I’m starting to enjoy barleywines more and this one is near the top of my list."
4921,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.14,"Reviewing this after having it about 2 months ago. Although was a good imperial stout, considering the hype around this beer and the cost, I was disappointed."
4922,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.54,"(Most recent) Bottle courtesy of Brewzma L - Beautiful golden haze, strong white head with good lacing S - Citrus and mango on the nose, hint of alcohol kick on the back end T - Strong orange-pineapple flavor, some resin on the back end F - smooth, light carb,  O - When fresh one of the better DDH beers on the market. Quite enjoyable."
4923,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,5.0,honestly this beer is tough to beat. I'll try new beers all the time thinking they're great and then i'll pick up some fuzzy baby ducks and it just mops the floor with them. Great beer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4924,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.22,Apr 2020 Review
4925,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.6,
4926,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.66,This one is probably worthy of a full review... First great label - Fairly simple but the green and yellow really pop... Color is a slightly hazy mango-ish pale orange... Whipped white head with stellar retention... A bit of lacing clings to the glass... The aroma is everything you would expect - a wide array of tropical fruit and light pine... I could keep my nose hovered over the glass all day... Robust flavor with depth and exceptional mouthfeel... Big flavor but subtle mouthfeel... As expected a word class beer and exceptional IPA... Cheers...
4927,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.38,Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy pale yellow pour with a white head. Sour peach aromas. Big tart/sour notes with peach highlights. Lemon zest and citrus lowlights. Good body and mouthfeel.
4928,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.31,"Whoa! this is expensive for Non Imperial Stout. I forked out 5$ for a single 12 oz. bottle. I'm a fan of Funky Buddha & what they do for the Florida craft beer scene. There is interesting looking chocolate snowman artwork on the label. Wow! I am getting big coconut aroma from this beer. I am not seeing any DATE ON THE BOTTLE. A beer that has coffee & coconut adjuncts needs to have a date on the bottle somewhere. I am ascertaining big coconut, slight coffee. I can't lie to you this is scrumptious. If you like a sweet stout that does not have lactose added to it then this is up your alley although it is costly, but I don't downgrade beer because of their price. Pretty good porter that almost feels like a full bodied roasty stout. This is a sweet stout all the way with slight roasted malts, this is a beer that I would not session due to the sweetness of the coconut & the edginess of the coffee but it's a great one time, one bottle treat for the evening, but it's definitely not something that I would want to session Cheers! A-"
4929,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.5,"Another wonderful and worthy effort from Tree House, which is helping set standards for the style. This one has it all and is worthy of the high scores. Nose, balance, flavor character and biglasting finish. Very bold and drinkable."
4930,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.32,"Beautiful dark beer. Good head production, with a sizeable dark brown head sitting atop an ebony body. Massive dose of coffee on the nose - one of the most potent coffee-forward brews I have ever found. Along with waves of roast coffee, dark stout tones of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, and chocolate round out the profile. On the palate, the stout base initially asserts itself, although the huge coffee influence isn't far behind. It's a very fruity, berry-forward coffee profile. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, cream, blueberries, toast, light char, cherries, bark. Thick, smooth, creamy, still lively. Really a fantastic coffee imperial stout."
4931,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.08,"Tried this for the first time last year, but my review was deleted by *someone*? Nothing to compare this to, but if it's half as good as the last, then I am excited! Let's do.  12oz bottle (yes, bottle) - 2021 release - poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at 38°F. Pours a deep honey-golden, a touch amber, with two fingers of sticky off white head that leave some spotting being. Visible bubbles. Nose: Clean pale malt - grainy, slightly sweet, slightly bready with some honey drizzled and toasty caramel malt notes, and then just stacked woth big fresh hop notes. Floral, herbal, fir sap, lots of resins - grassy, dank, and pithy with and that Simcoe musty West Coast thing. Some hints of tangerine, pineapple, and persimmon.  Palate: Hopslam greets the palate with big sweet crystal malts and a bit of honey biscuit quality - bready, and just that classic, almost barleywine malt sweetness. Atop that, lots of West Coast leafy hop notes - dank Simcoe, tangerine, dried papaya, green leafy cones, candied citrus, and some classic spicy and herbal boiled hop notes. The finish is honey malt sweetness, malted barley, and by now, yhe hops begin to exhibit some sweet dried apricot, white grape, and some vaugue fruity bits, lacking any real pine or pith, but some resinous bitterness appears. Mouthfeel/Body: This one's pretty full-bodied. Heavy, slick, and weighty. The effervescence is lower, but helps a bit, and the hops dry out a touch on the finish, but the sweetness lingers. Hint of stickiness left around the lips.  Overall: Last year's batch was my first ever Hopslam, and it blew me away. For some reasons (HELP!) several of my reviews have completely vanished, including that one. Is this a good DIPA? Yeah, it's great. But from what I remember of the last batch, this is an entirely different beer. Less hops, more sweetness, and non of that beautiful character that made it so unique. Last one reminded me a lot of Pliny. This lacks that entirely. This drinks more like a weird alternate dimension Bigfoot. I bought several packs of last year's....I'm happy with just a single of this. Hopefully the last one wasn't just a fluke."
4932,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.17,"07 bottle. Pour is dark brown, almost black with red edges and a tiny bit of tan large bubbled head. Nose is nice, same rich chocolate cake as stormaktsporter, maybe more, and hints of bourbon and wood. Taste is rich, dessert like, creamy full body. Rich chocolate cake and bourbonn blend together adding notes of charred wood. Not sweet but adds some malt berery flavors in back finishing semi dry. My favorite of the 3 I tried."
4933,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.22,"375ml bottle, 2018 release, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 06.09.18, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a jet black color, thick and oily, very viscous with a thin tan head that has no retention nor any lacing. The aroma is pleasant, lots of rich maple, sweet and sappy, tons of fudge brownie, light stone fruits, oak, bourbon, toffee, dark grains with a lingering marshmallow vanilla fragrance. The flavors are very good, intense fudge brownie, lots of rich dark chocolates with some underlying sweet maple, oaky bourbon with a nice vanilla sweetness, char and roast with brown sugar that plays well with the maple and finishes warmly with a light fruity acidity. The mouthfeel is great, coating medium/full body, not quite chewy but very smooth and gentle, velvety with an effortlessly easy finish that has nice legs and a warming sensation. Verdict: A very good barrel aged imperial stout from Hill Farmstead. Rich flavors, balanced well that is very easy going. The maple adds a nice amount of sweetness to the beer but it brings with it some nice depth and complexity."
4934,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.58,"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights at 56 degrees; thick tan foam of mixed bubbles; solid ring, long lasting cap; moderately heavy lacing; thin legs. Strong maple syrup nose; faint whiff of smoke. Flavors of maple, coffee, sweet toffee and caramel candy base; lite roast, char. Full body, slick feel; very little warmth for 9.5%; moderate minus carbonation. Overall the maple has held up well; I could smell the maple wafting from the glass at least a foot plus away; not too adjuncty; the bacon is more a liquid smoke taste, but the dominant taste and aroma is Mrs. Butterworth’s. Funky Buddha excels at flavored pastry stouts, and this beer is one of its best."
4935,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.04,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. No date on the bottle, but I know it is at least a few years old at this point. A: Black pour. A little bit of a beige head struggles to form and ultimately fails. Little to no lacing. Not all that concerning for a barrel aged beer of its strength. S: The chiles are much more forward on the nose than expected, and that’s the first whiff emanating from the glass. Heavy dose of roasty coffee next, followed by a fat fudgey chocolate smell. Chocolate sauce and German chocolate cake. Roasted malt. Oak and whiskey come out more as it warms.  T: In taste, it’s the massive tide of chocolate that hits first. Tons of hot fudge sauce, chocolate truffles, German chocolate cake, fatty nibs, etc. Lots of vanilla too, mingling for a malted milkshake impression. Nutty and roasty coffee brings in a mocha flavor. Lots of whole chile taste too. The heat is extremely mild, but the flavor is big and rides to the forefront for a bit. Oak and whiskey are actually the quietest component, surprisingly, but that sweet whiskey flavor does round things out nicely. Smokey coffee and a tingle of chile heat on the finish. M: Rich in body with a bit of heft. Chewy and mouth-coating. Velvety. Low and gentle carbonation.  O: A bombastic beer overall, and a bit of a roller coaster ride. Rather than melding into a cohesive whole, each ingredient basically takes a turn reaching out and slapping you right in the palate. It’s big, sweet, and straightforward. Even a little busy, if I’m being honest. That’s not to say it isn’t good- on the contrary, I really did enjoy it. If you’re a person who likes a nice “pastry stout,” you’ll likely love it. I think it’s a solid enough beer, but its brutish approach and bold, hedonistic flavors that vie for attention rather than coalescing can’t touch the more carefully composed and elite barrel-aged stouts. Very good, but not great."
4936,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.74,"poured from a 375... Look lots of carb on the pour, nice body Smell: fruit, grapefruit and funk Taste: Great grapefruit taste, lots of carb on the taste, good juiciness Feel: nice mouth feel, little carby, smooth taste, drink warm!"
4937,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,5.0,"Becoming somewhat more accessible, I had this at Brick Store Pub (ATL) on draft for Zwanze day 2019 and in a bottle at Porter Beer bar. Amazing balance of sweet, sour, and funk from a knock punch of Cherries to the palate. Would have a third time if I see it up north."
4938,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.87,"pours a gorgeous murky yellow. smell is big pineapple, orange, and pine, some light peach as well. taste is HUGE and pungent: clementines, pineapples, mangoes, peaches, dank weed and grass, no malt apparent. just the very slightest bit of booze but it balances it. mouthfeel is awesome, killer DIPA fuzz. perfect brew, I know they said it was a one time brew, but this may my favorite double IPA from trillium. please brew it again!! if not, Scaled Up will suffice.... i guess......"
4939,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.82,"Myself and 3 kids started a bike trek towards the minuteman trail. Youngest one takes a spill at minute 15, knees and elbows. We trudge on. Oldest flats her tire at minute 45. In 90 degree sweltering weather, we have to walk it back. My partner drives by but can only fit 3 of the bikes. So, I in my lonesome pedal back to the house, (uphill both ways of course) knowing that I’ve been saving this beer for an occasion just like this. The four of them are up in the house, and I, in my lonesome, pulled out the folding beach chair in the backyard and popped open Doppelgänger in the shade. Fruity citrus aroma popping out of the can. Great balance on the hops, with the bitterness controlled. Simply refreshing in the mouth. Maybe I drank this a little too quickly."
4940,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.35,"Very good NE style IPA, that is, hazy unfiltered IPA which is in fact brewed in NE. It's called Double Nelson so I'll assume they're really trying to focus on the Nelson Sauvin hop. That white wine flavour which accompanies this hop is the primary hop flavour in the profile, and I've been somewhat put off by this in the past, especially with Brut IPAs, but here it is really well done, leading to a very nice flavour, smooth mouthfeel, and pleasant sweet finish to each sip. Hill Farmstead is off the beaten path, not the greatest to get to, & my god, do they take their damn time getting the line up to move through their brewery. I would say Treehouse or the Alchemist can move people through about 3 times as fast with the same number of staff. So, while I have enjoyed the Hill beer I've had, I doubt I'll make it back there again."
4941,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.74,From a 4 week old tin.
4942,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.19,"Drinking this in a dark bar so hard to get a good read on the appearance. Faint (very faint) notes of grass/earth and citrus rind on the nose, would expect more aromas from a HF IPA  Taste is somewhat muted, a little grapefruit bitterness, a little pine and not much else. Not as juicy or expressive as society and solitude offerings Feel is effervescent and light, good carb, doesn’t coat the mouth despite its abv Overall— good , and glad I tried this but prefer other HF hoppy offerings"
4943,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.39,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy, dark brown head. Smells of rich, dark chocolate, cinnamon and chili peppers, with a hint of vanilla, oak and quite a hot bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by rich, bitter chocolate, roasted malts and spicy chili peppers, with a good amount of vanilla and lighter notes of cinnamon, dark fruits: fig, raisins, some oak and a light earthiness. There's also quite a hot, boozy bourbon note to this. It starts out a little sweet, with the chocolate and vanilla standing out the most, but turns more a lot more bitter and warming in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness, vanilla notes, and some heat, both from the chili and booze, lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. This thankfully doesn't have that odd, floral chili note that normal Huna has, the chilies feeling a lot more sharp and spicy. A little less earthy and bitter as well, with more vanilla sweetness and a lot more booziness. slightly richer dark fruit notes as well. Mouthfeel is actually quite a bit worse though, not having quite that thick, almost viscous quality to it that normal Huna has. Still quite smooth though. I actually think that the heat from the chilies and the booze work together quite well to create quite an aggressive character works well with the bitterness and is balanced out nicely by a certain sweetness from the vanilla."
4944,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.43,2012 edition. 
4945,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.5,poured from a 16oz can into a willi becher pint glass. pours a very dark and oily black. gently poured so a finger’s worth of mocha head. the mocha color stays through the entire pour in the form of a ring around the edges with swirls in the middle. smell is strong chocolate and taste follows smell. this is a chocolate bomb! none of that half-ass coffee smell and taste i get with a lot of TH stouts. feel is full and very well carbonated. this packs a lot of flavor and is quite full on mouthfeel for a little 6.5% stout. been rather down on a lot of their stouts lately so glad to see that this one lives up to the always-present TH hype.
4946,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.75,"2013 vintage, tasted on 5/12/2020 - startled by how cakey that is. Super rich and thick body, a load of vanilla and chocolate. Light barrel and whiskey. Super pleasantly balanced, though definitely not a beer I could enjoy more than just a taste of. Novelty pastry juice for real - still, quite tasty."
4947,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.63,"Finally got to the brewery when they had this! 16 oz. can dated 8/27/19, poured into Aslin glass. L: Hazy golden with just a hint of orange. 1.5F soapy head with scant lacing and a ring. S: Peach-orange with just a hint of earth and pine. Nice and clean. T: Very much mirrors the nose. Not sure how flavors can be both bold and soft, but they've done it. What I like is the developing flavor profile from peach to citrus to ripe tropical to pine/earth. And in a pale ale! F: Moderate side of light-body, but smooth like a Christopher Cross song. Light to moderate carbonation. Very easy drinking. Construction and balance are superior. O: Probably too much ABV to be called a true sessionable ale, but this is the one you want. Put it right up alongside Julius and it's tough to pick a winner. So why pick? Drink them both."
4948,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.6,Solid beer - great balance to everything. Also great color to this beer and amazing offering. Looks like straw and has a dankness. Tastes like Belgium from Oregon.
4949,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.53,"There's good carbonation, despite absolutely no head in the clear pint glass after this was emptied from a twelve ounce brown bottle. A hot peppery smell dominates and behind it, some roasted malt and chocolate. The color of this brew is the common black coffee and without any head, nor lacing, this looks like it could be a black coffee soda. But the taste is so much more complex and interesting. First, this is incredibly smooth for a laceless stout. It has a very good body, rich and velvety across the tongue. There's much to taste, mostly chocolate, somehow neither sweet, nor bitter, a hint of vanilla and just a little peppery heat. It's definitely not a burn, just a little heat. Actually, there's more pepper to the nose than to the taste. But that's OK. Why argue with a near perfect balance. Absolutely no clue that this rings in with an astonishing 13% ABV. This might not be the best brew you've ever had, but it is certainly one you must try, should the chance arise."
4950,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.76,12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass at 53F. Bottled 9/14/18.
4951,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.49,"Appearance - The beer poured a big black inky black color with a deep mocha head.  Smell - The beer has a tremendous boozy chocolate nose. Far from hot, the alcohol lets you know it’s there.  Taste - My first thought was alcoholic milk chocolate. As things progressed, vanilla and coconut were noticeable. The coconut paired well with the coconut, keeping a sense of balance. The chocolate is lightly warming in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Little bubbles in the carbonation made the beer silky smooth. There was tremendous body with this beer.  Overall - It is not my favorite AC, but it is still very tasty."
4952,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.23,Canned on 9/18. Poured to Glass on 10/12.
4953,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.71,"500 mL bottle into a snifter 2013 vintage Damn, aging has done a little bottle of beer well. Decadent brew with aromas of vanilla bean, coffee and toasted oak, with an alcohol-warming tinge at the edge of the bouquet. Flavors are as smooth as a seven-year cellared wine (oh wait, that's basically what this is), as notes of milk chocolate, creamy lactose and oaky astringency make an eminently drinkable brew, masking all but a smidge of the alcohol. Creamy, viscous complexion is confirmed by its latte-like appearance. This is a good beer."
4954,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.75,"Had on tap and a cellared bottle, both aged 3 years without much difference, will sit on my other bottle for years. Brown body with a solid tan head and periodic lacing. Bourbon, oak, molasses, caramel, elevated yeast, cocoa, big dark fruit, and stale crusty bread make up the barrel forward yet complex nose, amazing. Taste is right on par with the world class nose: gooey caramel enlightened by the barrel with everything from the nose plus tobacco, earth and vanilins. Feel is warm, oh so smooth, has amazing yeast, oak, and barley depth, musty and gooey feeling all at once. Amazing, meets the hype for sure"
4955,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.63,Reviewed on 12/25/17
4956,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,3.45,"Thanks to Rub_this_BBQ for this one, from a LIF, during the recent CanCans BIF. 16oz can (dated 7/8/20) poured into 14oz teku. Poured fully murky, as expected, yellow color with well over an inch of white head that had very good retention and lacing. No malt/grain in the nose, but some pine showed through, and hints of tart citrus. On the tongue, there was notably more bitterness than is typical for the style, and low fruit flavors. The body was the expected light, had a bit of sharpness across the tongue, and a finish that was between dry and medium. Drinkability was good, the bitterness kept the beer interesting throughout. Overall, one of the better murkbombs I've had. Certainly worth trying if you see it."
4957,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.71,"Aroma is complex and very, very intense in aroma. Super funky aroma with breadiness, grape must etc. It's quite spectacular. Taste comes off moderate to high sour scale, high acidity, and a little bit boozy. Sweet as well blended with the sour. Not quite as funky in the taste as in the aroma. Feel is quite interesting as the sweet/sour taste you'd expect a cloying syrupiness in the back of your throat but it finishes very clean. Gets high marks for that. Overall this is quite the exceptional beer, but I think the high ABV and high acidity and sour lean it a tad too extreme and not subtle complex enough."
4958,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.68,"2020 vintage, so a few months old. A: Pours orangish-gold with a thin ring of bright white head and fine bubbles. Some effervescence. No lacing or much retention to speak of. S: Fresh cut apricot, a bit of orange and lemon, moderate but well integrated lactic acid, background barnyard funk that adds some complexity, a bit of hay, pepper, and vanilla. Really appealing. T: Loads of fresh apricot, a bit of lemon zest, tangerine, and orange rind, finishing with light oak and earthy and horseblanket brett. Light tartness through a long, elegant finish. M: Light bodied, crisp and fizzy, with medium-high carbonation. Mouth watering quality.  O: Really delicious fruited sour. Big fruit flavor with restrained sourness and a bit of bretty funk for complexity. I could drink pint upon pint of this if the weather were sufficiently warm."
4959,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.86,"Poured from a bottle. 2015 vintage, day after release. Smells like caramel apples and english toffee. Smooth! Amazingly smooth. Frosting. Melted caramel frosting. The flavors are not overly sweet and overly woodsy, but definitely there. Perfectly layered like a ganache. This is a sipper, and well worth the wait to try."
4960,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.75,L: Golden honeycomb hues with a thin white head
4961,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.21,"Served in a teku glass from the can.  Appearance: semi clear amber color with a lighter carbonation. White head initially did rise a notch over one finger's length.  Smell: slight pine feel which dissipates quickly.  Taste: Touch sweet citrus with grapefruit skin.  Mouth: Medium to full carbonation with an extra sticky body.  Overall: Good brew, west coat style ipa which sticks to your palates and is a huge thirst quencher."
4962,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.21,"Consecration - 9/17/2015 Look: Pours translucent and murky medium brown. Auburn and chestnut in the light. A beige colored head that disappears with a thin ring of foam around the edge of the glass. No lacing and no visible carbonation. Smell: The aroma is floral, powdery, perfumey and musty. A lot of wood. Fresh currant, cherry and blackberry. Citrus acidity and a faint amount of some apple cider vinegar. Taste: Sweet and sour. A hint of apple cider vinegar. Some cinnamon spice. Some berry flavored chocolate. Some pithy bitterness. The acidity level is medium for me.  Feel: Very smooth and low carbonation. Some more effervescence would help. Not sure if it’s flattened out a bit over time or not. Sweeter up front and dry on the finish.  Overall: You’d never know this beer is 10% other than feeling the alcohol. No alcohol on the aroma of taste. Definitely has some red wine similarities, but also many aspects from the mixed fermentation that you’d not expect in red wine. It’s really delicious."
4963,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.53,From the can as intended A: can’t tell in the can!
4964,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.56,"Shimmering burnt honey amber with a large, fuzzy white foam that clings in very large ridges. This 4 or more year old blend is very crackery and toasty of sesame seed character with a super mature, mild sourness that at first contributes lemon, grapefruit, and complex spicy funk that is far more balanced and mellow than a younger blend might be. As it comes to temperature, cracked black pepper and apple cider develop, bringing this to a very comforting, old world delight. Golden Blend has a medium body with a light froth and a tingly dry finish. What a fantastic brew! --- Having a blend 37 from season 19-20 in September 2021, I'm finding this mind-blowingly, startlingly clean. This is relative not just to any old 3F gueuze, but even to my past review of Golden Blend--of which I'm not sure the vintage, but it was definitely a paper labeled 375. It's just insanely clean and fluffy--and bright--exhibiting characteristics of apricot, white wine and pear. It's as if fruited by white wine grapes, while far less acidic than you would expect from a fruited 3F. And clearly, it's not actually fruited. Still, it's all the white grapes. I can't get over its super drinkability. My 4.36 score is getting upped."
4965,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.97,Other breweries that arent focusing on making pine the central-flavor of their IPAs aren’t doing it right.  This and MBC Dinner are THE IPAs to be drinking. Everything else is just a tie-over until the next tome this glorious beverage hits my lips. CHEERS!
4966,Leche Borracho,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.59,"On tap at the brewery. Al lot going on with this one, but the flavors really played well together. A spicy aroma with cinnamon, peppers, and subtle tequila. They were all there on the palate but joined by bourbon and chocolate. There was a nuttiness from the combination. Nothing was overdone and each sip allowed a fun exploration of the flavors. Big hefty feel to support all of this. Outstanding."
4967,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.26,"2015 purchased online from HOTD. Aged at least 3 years in bourbon barrels. The tasting notes on their website said there would be no carbonation but I did get a few big bubbles. Adam from the Wood comes across as aged (two syllables age-ed, not one) and venerable. He is ponderous and methodical, slow to get to the point. He is perhaps a bit past his prime, flabby in the midsection with thinning hair.  Trying to stay youthful, Adam wears a lot of leather these days. It still smell faintly of the cigars he gave up years ago. He can usually be found at a fading bar nursing a watery bourbon on the rocks with the ice long melted and munching maraschino cherries, pondering what was and wondering if it will be again.  If you ever get the chance to spend some time with him, do it. He knows a lot of good stories and has a hell of a good sense of humor."
4968,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.5,"Incredible beer. Been looking for this one for a while and obtained this one fresh from the brewery. 3/5/20 date printed on can. Pours a beautiful hazy yellow-orange color with fluffy white head and some small soapy rings of lingering lacing. Smells of fresh papaya, melon, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange. Also some malt, creamy vanilla, bread and weaker floral hops. Some nice dankness in there as well. Taste follows the nose, and I appreciated the dankness that isn't always present in Tree House's other NE style IPAs. Juicy, easy to drink, high ABV very well hidden. Smooth, creamy, soft mouthfeel, great carbonation. So well done!"
4969,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.42,"Tasted from 2016 bottle. Pours dark brown with light khaki colored head. Aroma with lots of Caramel and bourbon notes along with cocoa. Very sweet on taste and it hides the ridiculously high ABV extremely well. Brown sugar, molasses, caramel, chocolate and just a hint of coffee. Huge beer that’s very well done."
4970,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.5,"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a one pint can on December 24, 2019. Alter Ego is a member of the Julius family, taking the base of Julius and adding a tremendous amount of Mosaic to the dry hop with a kiss of Amarillo. What results is a beer with all the deliciousness of Julius with a pungent additional layer of citrusy complexity."
4971,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.71,"Soooo smooth yet bitingly citrusicy, if that is a word,. My mouthfeel just exploded as I swirled it. Great beer and I am so glad I went to TH a few days ago and was able to purchase 12 Greens. YAY for me and a select few of my beer drinking friends."
4972,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.54,Incredibly balanced in terms of aroma and taste. Mouthfeel like a stout as the flavor lingers on the palate. More of a savor then session type IPA but well worth it!
4973,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.74,"Amber in color, but VERY clear otherwise. Head was malty white in color. Nose is slightly citrus. Taste is where the magic happens. Nice hoppy bitterness with the backbite us hopheads love. 9% did not feel like it. Good beer, nay GREAT beer!"
4974,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,3.52,"Inky black with a low head despite a vigorous pour. Aroma of chocolate and sweet malt. Rich flavor, chocolate and coffee. Heavy flavors, matches the aroma, just shy of cloying, overly sweet. Full and heavy mouthfeel. This beer is a bit much, very over done."
4975,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.34,"Bottle. Dark brown pour with a chocolate head. Huge chocolate cake bouquet. Well shit, that is a chocolate treat. Don’t get me wrong, this bad boy is Uber sweet but it’s exactly as advertised. It’s literally a liquid version of chocolate cake. As it warms up the bourbon, oak, vanilla start to show up. Really good body and mouthfeel."
4976,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.19,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 9/8/17 with ""HOLD ON TO"" written above it and sunshine written below it. Loved the name and label of this beer, down to the ""9/20/14"" on the side which was probably the marriage date referenced in the description. This was a typical beer from Tree House and a typical New England IPA in the sense that was cloudy, juicy, and soft but the latter made this so easy to enjoy as the Citra and Nelson were easy to discern as they worked so harmoniously together. This had a good pour to it as the liquid looked like faded orange juice, with just a bit more head present here! It held it's own and the lacing on the side of my pint glass was quiet extensive as well as the rings were well-defined and nearly bled down to the ones below them. Tons of orange juice, tangerine, cream, sherbert, and muted earthy dankness in the nose as the citrus slickness came through more boldly in the taste. Melon, white grape, and a bit of woodsy dankness could be felt in the taste as this almost felt barrel-aged but was just a result of the Nelson coming through. The malt was present as this had body but it was tough to pick out any of it besides a basic doughy presence and the carbonation was sufficient enough to keep this from feeling too heavy. Not a lot of alcohol here but what was present could be felt when I finished this off and lend itself to a slight warming feeling that took hold of me before I polished this off. Just as smooth as the Julius or Haze, this was on par with those while having a bit more depth and earth dankness to it. Love the idea of this and would love to get my hands on a more recent version of it just to see if it's the same take this time around. Long live this beer, in perpetuity!"
4977,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.71,"Probably my favorite beer that I've had from Alpine. Danky pine and citrus goodness, with a good mouthfeel and crisp finish. I now understand what I've been missing, and thankful for them bottling this and for the awesome trader that sent this my way. One step closer to dying happy."
4978,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.38,"Look: Pale yellow body, 1 finger white head.  Smell: Same as below. Taste: Lemon, melon, grains, oak, mild barnyard. Maybe a hint of white grape. Feel: Medium-light body, medium carbonation, mild tartness. Finishes dry."
4979,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.5,"Pours an opaque orange color with a thick, off-white head and tons of thick lacing. The smell is incredible from several feet away. Loaded with bright orange, mandarin, and grapefruit along with tropical pineapple notes. The taste is earthy tropical flavors, underripe pineapple, orange zest, with a bitter, floral finish. The mouthfeel is superb. It's pillowy smooth with low carbonation and a thick body. Overall, this is amazing, with a great blend of flavors and outstanding feel."
4980,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.28,"22 oz bomber gifted from Donald and poured into a Prairie rastal glass.  Deep inky black with a heavy finger of dark beige head that recedes to a thick fingernail and sticks around.  Aroma of soy sauce and bourbon barrel, some tobacco, and some milk and dark chocolates.  Flavor brings heavy alcohol, soy sauce, dark chocolate, tobacco, bourbon barrel, and piney hops. There is some chili pepper in there as well somewhere.  Feel is hot, burning, scathing even, and thick with a delicate creaminess that disappears as soon as the heavy carbonation comes forward.  Overall, I was hoping my 3,000th beer would be something really special, and this one came a little short of it. I could take more sweetness and molasses overall, this was more just pine, soy sauce, and bourbon barrel. Very cutting and linear. I much prefer the original non-barrel aged version."
4981,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,5.0,"This is probably the best beer I've ever had. Luscious, creamy, coffee is strong, sweet without being overpowering. It's really enjoyable from beginning to end."
4982,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.75,Opened a 2012 version on September 25th for anniversary. I love how the Bourbon scaled back some of the sweetness you encounter with the base Dark Lord. 6 years of age on the bottle and it held up extremely well.
4983,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.25,"You know i pounded 7 of these and I did not even yak. Had a killer hangover, but luckily I had one left and that helped with the shakes. Mind you, I am a 300 pound former NFL lineman so I know how to put them back. Overall, I would say very crushable and I would recommend."
4984,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.5,"Really interesting what double the coffee of Tree House Double Shot will do. Sweetness comes to the fore in a big way. Then brown sugar gives way to intense roast as the coffee comes through. This almost jet-black, smooth and full-bodied Milk Stout is an instant Tree House classic!"
4985,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.39,"Canned 09/07/20 Pours a light but opaque orange. On the nose I'm getting the honey and citrus, and can definitely smell the strength. Taste really follows the nose except the citrus comes first, followed by a very interesting aftertaste of malt followed by honey. Mouthfeel is great but I feel like the carbonization is a bit sharp. Overall, a beer you can't go wrong with."
4986,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.57,A: Straw with some lovely effervescence. Nice white head that sticks around.
4987,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.42,"500ml bottle. 2017 Series, Batch No 02. 13.5%ABV."
4988,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.79,"12 oz bottle, poured into a goblet at 40 degrees F and allowed to warm during consumption. L: Poured an inky black with no real head to speak of, and what little did form vanished quite swiftly. S: Thick black bread leapt out of the bottle upon the cap being removed, and swirled in the air during the pour. Alongside it, blackstrap molasses, petrichor with fresh herb garden topsoil, chopped walnut, and oaky booze are prominent in the nose when cold. As it warms, the walnut aroma becomes far more prevalent. T: When cold, this opens as a mouthful of herb garden soil just after a spring rain, with both chopped walnut and wet green walnut husk present. Black bread lurks in the background, and oaky tannic barrel notes slither around the edges. The aftertaste contains a touch of spicy heat. As it warms, those characteristics remain, but additional layers begin to appear - some dark sugary fruit like raisins, figs, and dates, molasses, a tinge of leather, and some distant cocoa. The heat remains in the aftertaste. F: Full and thick, this brings to mind liquid bread blended to syrup. O: This is a complex delight of a barrel-aged stout. But hey, it's Jackie O's. They're not exactly a slouch of a brewery."
4989,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.83,"A - As dark as a beer can get. Even the bubbles are the darkest I've ever seen. Pours a thick motor oil consistency. Lots of dark lacing around the glass. A very good looking stout. S - You definitely get the apple brandy right off the bat. Oak, Vanllla, Chocolate, Maple Syrup with just a hint of peppers. T - So big and boozy. The apple brandy stands out but in a good way. It definitely hides the peppers a little bit compared to regular Hunahpu but it's a nice added layer of complexity. Huge vanilla, chocolate and maple syrup notes. Also dark fruits and molasses. The apple brandy after taste if awesome. M - Amazing feel. Creamy and velvety with a little carbonation. O - This is one of those beers that I checked off that I'd never get to try. So glad to have the opportunity to have this and have it live up to the hype. One of the best beers I've ever had. I gave up a lot to get this but it was worth every penny."
4990,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.52,Very dark appearance with minimal tan head. Aroma is a nice slightly sweet caramel with a touch of spice. Taste is also a slightly sweet caramel with a little spicy heat.
4991,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.02,"Can dated 6/30/21 into pint glass. Pours a clear deep gold color, with a persistent off-white head. Great lacing. Initial impression is juicy citrus, pine resin, and a huge hops bite - old school West Coast. Mouthfeel is clean and quite hefty - perfect for a DIPA. Finish is clean and fairly bitter - none of this caramel stuff. Overall, a great alternative to the NEIPAs - which I love dearly, but every so often you gotta take a break. Hop Juju will smack you alongside the head."
4992,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.65,"Pours a rather hazy yellow with a finger of soapy white head. This looks great. Dense haze, nice foam, and solid retention.  Nose is tropical notes, pineapple and mango, peach, and grassy/piney hops. A touch of candy like quality. Sweetness. This smells great as well. Taste follows the nose. Tropical notes. Pineapple and mango. The sweet peach is here too. Juicy fruit flavors. Grass and pine are stronger. There is also this savory quality that lingers in the aftertaste. Like onion initially. But on the finish it merges with the malt backbone. Such a distinct savory finish. Really well balanced. Medium bitterness and mild hop burn, but never gets too overwhelming. Mouthfeel is smooth. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. An almost silky quality. Light and very drinkable. Overall a fantastic IPA. My introduction to Trillium and a spectacular one indeed."
4993,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.35,"03/2017 - dig the vanilla, fruity aromas that dominate up front, plus some coffee; the palate is chock full of nice barrel, plus some more vanilla, coffee, and dark chocolate; the body is quite enjoyable, but the finish is a bit tannic amidst all those other great qualities."
4994,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,5.0,"Batch 3 at a bottle share. This is a stunner and greatly exceeded my expectations. I actually liked this better than Ann, so I'm a bit surprised by the lower ratings."
4995,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.63,"Pours very hazy orange gold color with a fantastic looking 2-3 finger thick beige colored head that faded extremely slowly and left thick foamy rings after each sip. Very nice! Smells of orange peel, grapefruit, tangerine, faint pineapple, papaya, a dash of floral hops, tea leaf and biscuit. Pretty well balanced. Tastes of sweet, dank citrus fruit with a mix of grapefruit, orange juice, pineapple, tangerine, orange peel, guava, lemonade, piney notes, caramel, brown sugar, honey, wet wheat bread, light peppery spices and floral notes and then a hint of booze. It’s very complex yet very balanced while remaining hop centric. It’s crazy how well the 10% ABV is hidden. Nice mid level of bitterness to add character and make this much easier to drink than it should be. A really damn good beer."
4996,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.04,Reviewed on 6/5/17. 2016 bottle L - Pours a dark brown with a thin mocha colored head.
4997,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.74,"L: Hazy yellow/orange with a thick, rocky head and excellent lacing S: Huge peachy nose. Very citrusy as well with some tropical fruit salad in the mix. The malt adds a honey like sweetness to the aroma that blends beautifully with the hop character. T: Moderate bitterness, huge hop flavor. Juicy orange, peach, mango, and grapefruit. The malt has a similar character to the aroma and again really amplifies the juiciness of this beer. F: Medium bodied, crisp, dry finish. Overall: I have had few beers that can compare to this beers hop flavor saturation. It is very impressive. It also still manages to integrate this hop flavor with the malt and yeast ester profiles. I can see why this beer is so hyped, it is so easy to approach and delivers a ridiculous load of flavor."
4998,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.54,"500 ml bottle from 2017. Poured into tulip. Pours a dark, dark brown (I can’t say that it’s black), finely bubbled creamy tan head, recedes to just a fine inner ring. "
4999,Ann,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.75,"Batch 4, 375mL bottle served into a bulb glass onsite 4/18/18.  First half of pour was crystal clear golden body, second half was slightly hazy and a bit more orange. Good two finger white head that sticks around for a while.  Aroma – I didn’t smell these all at once, I don’t even think that would be humanly possible, but noted them as it warmed and developed in the glass over a half hour or so. Honey. Lemongrass. Nectar. A delicate woodiness. Floral. Vanilla. Cedar. That musty, herbal smell when you walk into an old country store. Grassy. Hay. Pine cones. White wine. Potpourri. Fresh spring day frolicking through a meadow of hay.  On the tongue it’s big but soft, delicate citrus and lemongrass, tart lactic and white wine, lightly funky with oak and a bit of mustiness. Honey comes through on the finish. Not overly dry but not sweet either. Lightly carbed with a very drinkable body.  I’m glad I finally got to try this beer, it was quite the treat and worth the wait."
5000,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.46,No sure how I haven't reviewed this one yet. 2011 vintage pulled from the cellar
5001,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.49,"I received this from @bum4ever in a BIF box. It was a ""mystery"" beer and my initial notes were made without knowing its identity. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a slightly hazy bright gold with orange hues. The effervescent, ecru-colored head dissipated quickly giving it a champagne-like appearance. It has the unmistakable smell of brett yeast, along with lemon and perhaps a hint of lime. There is also a distinct smell of oak. It's very fragrant. As expected, the taste opens strongly sour with bitter lemon notes. There is also a subtle taste of grape that gives it a small amount of balancing sweetness. As the glass warms you can increasingly taste the oak barrel and it finishes fairly bitter. The flavors blend very well. As expected for a Wild Ale, the feel is crisp and light with lively carbonation, and the 6% ABV doesn't distract from appreciation of the flavors. Overall, this is by far one of the finest Wild Ales I've had the pleasure to drink. Thank you, Josh, for the opportunity."
5002,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.54,Can from last week's release. Been after this beer for a long time.  Appearance - It was extremely clean and clear like filtered apple juice. Copper in color which I find to be typical of a west coast IPA. Minimal head that dissipated quick.  Aroma - Not much going on here. Very muted. Get a little bit of hop aroma but you really have to dig and get your nose in there to find it. Wish it was more pungent. Flavor - This is where the beer shines for me. Extremely balanced. Malt and hops are in perfect harmony here. No malt sweetness. It's very clean drinking with great balance and a nice subtle hop bite on the end.  Feel - Super light bodied for a 8.88% double ipa. Drinks like a lager almost. Carb was champagne like with lots of tiny bubbles. Maybe that contributes to the light body. I feel like I could drink quite a few of these no problem.  Overall - Excellent balance and flavor in this. One of the cleanest and most drinkable WC double IPAs I've had. Would like more aroma but overall this beer is excellent.
5003,Bourbon County Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.81,"My first-ever tasting of the legendary beer. 2020 version poured into a shallow tulip.  A - Pitch black motor oil. Barely perceptible faint, tan head disappears in a minute."
5004,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.29,"It poured a hazy peach color with a foamy white head. The nose is earthy, musty and very floral with notes of lemon and melon. The taste is surprisingly bitter with heavy notes of grapefruit pith. Minimally sour but still has that lambic funk with a cider quality and mild lactic acidity. The mouthfeel is light bodied with mild acidity. Its actually not harsh on the palate, quite easy to drink.  Overall: its a great beer. Not as complex as I expected, but its simplicity is not a bad thing. Its quite similar to to FFG Last Four Winters in Wisconsin and New Glarus Vintage series. It would be fun to have them all side by side."
5005,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.26,"Hardly zero head or carbonation in a 2013. Taste was bourbon soaked raisans. Sweet but quite pleasant. It didn't look great and it was prob a little thin for the abv and the barrel, but defintely respect the old ale style and would not turn it down again."
5006,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.6,"08/2015 - Raspberry jam fosho, tannic, funk, and barnyard up front; very tart, big acidity, more raspberries, and just jam on the palate; flavorful finish of raspberry, cherry, and a wee bit of pepper to round it out."
5007,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.68,"375ml bottle, from the 2017 release. Served in a snifter glass. Pours an ugly as shit murky brown body, one finger white head, short retention, no lacing. This is a damn ugly beer, even for barleywines. Smell is transcendent; huge caramel, toffee, bourbon notes, distinct sweet brandy/cognac notes, with trace of spicy fruit on the backend. This is as metal/barleywine as it gets. Flavour follows, thick syrupy caramel, mild earthy bitterness that does just enough to balance it out and prevent this beer from being too sweet or cloying. No alcohol heat, plenty of oak and whiskey flavours, toffee, touch of resin and spice. Wonderful. Mouthfeel is full bodied, not cloying or syrupy, incredibly substantial, lots of complexity throughout, with a sweet nutty toffee finish. Overall, a damn delicious barleywine. I like this better than the single cognac releases that signify the first 3 releases."
5008,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.94,"Well rounded nose with mango and pineapple. The fruit flavors are more muted in comparison to the nose. On the sweeter, malty body. Was expecting a little more from this highly rated DIPA. Chalking this up to the Nov canning date vs today's date of consumption."
5009,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.57,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. Look- Pale gold, opaque, visible sediment, white frothy head, above average head retention, average lacing. Smell- Brett, earthy, oak, peach, pear, apple. Taste- complex, mildly sweet peach/pear flavor transitions to sour more intense peach finish, brett, spicy. Feel- Medium body, crisp, dry finish, above average carbonation."
5010,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.8,"Canned 08/26/20 Pours a hazy orange with two fingers of foam. Immediate smelling waves of orange juice and mango - wow, the smell immediately fills the room when poured into a glass. Taste follows the nose with an emphasis on the orange. Trademark Treehouse pillowy soft mouthfeel. Hands down best hazy IPA I’ve ever had."
5011,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.2,"What an amazing color!!..a semi-cloudy light strawberry color with a quickly disappating light pink head. Aroma is full, so full. of strawberries, light cranberries and sweet cherries. Taste has just a light touch of sourness from the cherries and a great balance of sweetness in the form of cherries and raspberries. Yeast and Belgian feel is so light and makes this beer so so drinkable at 7%abv. The tartness lays on the tip of the tongue and does not overpower the goodness of the main ingredients. Finish is incredibly refreshing and has a great feel of fresh beries throughout.This one is a winner !"
5012,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,3.84,"Canned 4/7/17; drank 4/16/17 @ the Yarchives.  Opaque yellow/orange appearance.  A violent pour yielded a huge off-white head; strong, frothy tree-run lace.  Pineapple, orange citrus & watermelon jolly rancher notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Grapefruit & pineapple flavors up front; watermelon jolly rancher notes on the finish. No booze heat.  Too much mosaic (the watermelon jolly rancher flavor) for me to embrace, but this is a well-made NE IPA. It's just not for me."
5013,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.73,"Pours light amber with a 1 1/2"" white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end. Aroma is floral, pine, grapefruit, mango. Taste is strong pine, grapefruit zest, mango, orange, slight lemon. Resinous. Medium bodied, lively carbonation. Dry, resinous finish. Outstanding! One of the best IPA's I've had."
5014,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.66,"Pours a dark, non-see-through, coffee/espresso with a moderate head that dissapates quickly but lingers on the glass.  Smell is that of coffee, toffee, and malt. Taste is rich, full-bodied, and slightly sticky sweet with a bitterness that lingers on the palate for quite a while after each sip. Notes are similar to smell.. with coffee, dark chocolate and toffee at the helm. I'm not picking up on th oatmeal, but it could be because the other flavors are dominant. Alcohol is hidden well at 8.3%, but still noticeable. Mouth feel is full bodied and syrupy, but not sickeningly so.  Definitely drinking this one slowly.  I'm really enjoying this stout. Flavors are all balanced nicely. Because it's so heavy, though, this is one for enjoying on special occasions or as a meal replacement (jk) ."
5015,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.37,"500 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Blend 5, bottled in 5/2018. Pours fairly hazy deep reddish orange/amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy pink head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing eventually. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge sour/tart/tangy red/black cherries, fruit skin/pits, lemon, lime, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red/green apple, currant, red grape/wine, oak, peppercorn, hay, straw, grass, wheat, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of leathery/musty Brett funk, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Amazing aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of cherries, fruity/funky/acidic/spicy yeast, wine barrels, and moderate pale/wheat malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge sour/tart/tangy red/black cherries, fruit skin/pits, lemon, lime, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red/green apple, currant, red grape/wine, oak, peppercorn, hay, straw, grass, wheat, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of leathery/musty Brett funk, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tartness, fruit tang, and yeast/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart/tangy red/black cherries, fruit skin/pits, lemon, lime, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red/green apple, currant, red grape/wine, oak, peppercorn, hay, straw, grass, wheat, cracker, white bread, light funk/vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of cherries, fruity/funky/acidic/spicy yeast, wine barrels, and moderate pale/wheat malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/tartness, tangy fruit, and yeast/oak spiciness balance; with no puckering/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp finishing. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering tart/tang/spiciness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately grainy/acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 6.1%. Overall this is an amazing fruited sour/wild ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of cherries, fruity/funky/acidic/spicy yeast, wine barrels, and moderate pale/wheat malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly acidic/tangy/tannic/drying finish; not overly lactic/tannic. Amazing balance of super juicy/jammy cherries, and Brett/Bacteria complexity; great oak presence, and pale/wheat malt backbone against acidity. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazing top tier quality style example as expected."
5016,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.43,"Look - Poured into a teku, thicker than your average stout. Nice tan head with bubbles of varying thickness. Smell - Coffee aroma with underlying chocolate notes, roasty malt goodness. Not very boozy on the nose. Taste - This beer had the perfect balance of coffee and stout. There was some sweetness without being cloying. The chocolate notes were rich but lingered in the background. Very little alcohol taste perceptible to me. Feel - It felt very nice on the palate. The thickness gave it a velvety mouthfeel, but it didn't coat my mouth in the way that some stouts can. Overall - Great stout with big yet balanced flavor. Very drinkable for it's abv. I could make this my go-to coffee stout if I had regular access to it. Highly enjoyable."
5017,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.5,"Tried the 2017 which was one of the best Porters I've ever had. Great all around nose, balance, mouthfeel, flavor profile and finish. Wonderful fresh and still great a couple of years later."
5018,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.92,The look right out of the bottle looks amazing. Has a great mouth feel that is like drinking brownie batter. Like many AC stouts it is sweet but the barrel helps keep the sweetness down some.
5019,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.66,"Vintage 2018, drank on Feb 17th, 2020. I'm really impressed by the way in which the maple has held up in this beer - it's not just an adjunct flavor, but also a richness to the texture and mouth feel that make it different from the standard Mexican Cake (or barrel-aged variants). The spices play surprisingly well with the sweetness of the maple - I'm really surprised by this in particular. It's not something that sounds great, but the final product is quite good. The barrel is very nice to boot - mellow bourbon, smooth, no alcohol burn. I'm really amazed by how reasonably this bottle was had - it's a terrific beer and really should command more in trade."
5020,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.5,"Would I buy this again? Yes, but only one bottle cellared at a time. Do t see any reason to cellar for extended period of time or collect for verticle."
5021,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.54,"2016 release reviewed on 10-31-2020. Pours a very dark brown. Almost no head, as expected with such a high ABV beer. What was there was tan, but went away rapidly. However there is a bit of carbonation rising in the glass. and it's refreshing a ring of foam around the edge of the glass. "
5022,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,3.84,"Canned on 1/22/20 Pours an oily, jet-black capped with ~¾ finger of fizzy khaki-mocha foam retreating from the center outward almost immediately to a consistent foamy collar, sporadic spatter of tight lacing, and an uncapped surface with a persistent effervescence. Aroma shows a heavy hit of creamy lactose opening into a peanut butter tone equal parts roasty and creamy, as well as vanilla and a light espresso backing; milk chocolate quickly grains a prominence firmly in the background as a bit of roast engages mildly over time. Taste brings espresso and lactose at the forefront, with a very passive peanut butter nuttiness barely perceptible in the background; dry cocoa and Swiss Miss shine on the mid-palate, while an aged lactose-espresso lingering persists though the semi-sweet finish. Mouthfeel offers a slick medium-heavy body with a delicate fizzy carbonation spread along the palate; oily and increasingly sticky, but more subtly so against a steadily encroaching dry roastiness into the finish. A promising harmony ot peanut butter and espresso upfront fades rather quickly to a more mundane, though competently done, sweet stout profile; the depth is there, but the notes remain muddled and the promised peanut butter an afterthought. Still, the late integration of roastier times leaves this a relatively satisfying, if not top-tier, take on the style."
5023,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.56,"Poured from a bottle (06Jun2019) into a Belgian glass L: pours a perfectly clear gold/amber with a moderate white head that fades after a couple minutes. Leaves a great ring of foam around the edge with some moderate lacing S: lives to its name with the first whiff, really gorgeous and deep tropical fruit and citrus aroma. Followed behind by a mild tart/barnyard funk and great depth from the wine barrel aging. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, some apricot, orange, pleasant acidity T: follows the nose well, fruit nose comes through but takes a backseat to the base ale. Slightly funky, nicely tart farmhouse flavor with some notable wine barrel structure and depth. Fruit there from the nose, increasing as it’s warmed. Again grapefruit and pineapple, more of that orange as well as apricot. Medium long finish F: light+/medium- body, medium/medium+ carbonation, slightly drying, moderate acidity O: a delicious farmhouse ale (no surprise there) with a really great and differentiated nose. Up against stiff competition with the rest of the HF line-up, manages to differentiate itself well"
5024,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.29,"750ml waxed and capped bottle into a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303.  On first examination, this actually looks a little thin. Thin legs and very little head. Nose is robust and very aromatic. Big bourbon notes waft over hints of soy sauce, chocolate, fudge, plum, prune and molasses. Great complexity. Beer opens chocolate, soy sauce, molasses and big, accented, boozy bourbon. Syrupy in the beginning and middle with fudge and dried dark fruit notes. Hot throughout and tobacco notes going down. Body is full with low carbonation. Slick, oily and boozy in the mouth and goes down very hot.  There's great complexity in this beer but the bourbon and booze is just over-the-top at times. Well worth trying but this could still use a year or two and make sure to get at least 4 or 5 friends together for this."
5025,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.0,"5800th review! 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/14/2016. Listed at 7% on the label. Cork was wet under the cap, and almost fell apart removing it. Pours lightly hazy ruby reddish orange/pink/purple color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of complexity of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tartness; light fruit tang and yeast/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, cracker, light leather/funk/vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/tartness balance, and zero puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from tartness and tangy/tannic fruit/oak. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an excellent fruit lambic. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly lactic/tangy/tannic/drying finish. Well rounded Brett complexity and solid Lacto presence. Perfectly balanced between grapes, oak, and malts. Was expecting way more out of this. Not as much depth in funky complexity, and not as jammy/vinous on fruit character as I wanted. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example otherwise."
5026,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.13,"I found this variation to obviously be of the same commendable quality as ""plain"" BAMC, but a bit sweeter with a touch more raisin. I didn't really get the smoky, caramelized maple flavor I was hoping for, but hey, can't complain about getting another version of barrel aged Mexican Cake. It still has that distinct spicy heat with a slick, thin body that finishes semi-dry."
5027,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.58,Pitch black with a think mocha head. Rich milk chocolate and coffee with a hint of maple and a milkshake mouth feel. All the flavors were popping months after the release.
5028,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.5,"So there were, what, four or five weeks on Beer Advocate where everyone was posting trades for Appervation, right? I sure hope all of those traders were happy with what they received. I ended up receiving my bottle in a slightly unplanned way - I hadn't been in to the hype, but was still pleased to locate and try a bottle. But, cautious. I was skeptical of the hype and didn't want to be disappointed. I've been hurt too many times in the past! I made the mistake of giving this one a shot when it was still too cold. The carbonation was practically non-existent - only the tiniest little foaming tipped me off that the bottle hadn't gone bad. Relief! The alcohol notes are definitely a bit unpleasant when the beer is still cold - it's probably the worst example I've found recently of how stouts are very temperature-sensitive. But, after it warms up - the chocolate and bourbon come alive. The alcohol remains strongly in the nose, taste, and mouth feel, but the flavors open up wonderfully. Appervation is quite good - but, in all honesty, I'd have traded mine in a moment for another bottle of Double Barrel Dark Apparition."
5029,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.88,2016 edition.
5030,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.06,"Canned on 8/5/20 Pours a totally opaque dark orange body topped with a fluffy two fingers of dense, white foam; very good head retention fades steadily to a thin veil of cap, slight, frothy collar, and well-dispersed, moderately dense splotches of lacing around the glass. Aroma brings out waxy lychee, savory, seasoned mango, and pumpernickel bread upfront, with an intensely herbal twang interspersed between and hints of ripe strawberry evolving over time; the savory, almost agricole rhum-like fruity qualities here are almost undoubtedly the accurately attributed jackfruit notes. Taste offers gritty papaya and pumpernickel to open, eventually embracing more tropical notes starting with a silky lime mid-palate; an intense array of grains and tropical oils burst forth on the back end as dank orange zest, pineapple, and raw white grape must lingers. Mouthfeel shows a medium body against a subdued, milder carbonation; a lightly prickly texture is apparent as a soft yet weighty bitterness encroaches, though remains plush of silky-smooth at the surface along the palate; a resinous, airy finish provides a uniquely fitting close. With such an intense amalgam of hop notes radiating from this brew, it becomes almost difficult to manage, and remains one of the more eclectic expressions of inherently earthy tropical notes I've encountered in a NEIPA; married with an almost equally unique malty undertone and dense bitterness, it is a consistently approachable display of intense, hoppy depth."
5031,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.34,"From a tallboy can packaged 5/18/21. Cloudy golden color with a half inch of white foamy head. Smells of grapefruit. Light and somewhat creamy feel. Grapefruit flavors with some light malt in the background. The pale ale/IPA line is getting fuzzy... could easily call this a session IPA. In any case, it's nicely balanced and very tasty."
5032,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.59,"Crystal clear yellow with a dark white head. Dank hops, tropical fruit, with lingering citrus zest in the nose. Taste opens the citrus more, some honey now in play, super hoppy bitters and dankness, some stone fruit in the background. Feel is not as swirlingly complex as some other alpine ipas, but still has hop molding with a strong malt base."
5033,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.52,"Had on tap. At last, the stout that I have sought the longest! And it did not disappoint! Midnight black with a mushroom cap, textures reveal themselves in certain lightings. Chocolate brownies, bourbon, wood, vanilla, coffee, soil, molasses, and malts o plenty in the nose. Tastes as it smells, caramel makes a strong appearance, dark fruits and coconut in a lesser way, but less coffee and earth. Feel is malty, lush, warm, thick, yet sweeter. While very good I think I would go back to the orignal more often."
5034,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.77,"Berries, white grape, tropical fruits, pineapple, passionfruit, citrus, grapefruit, some caramelized malt, floral, earthy dankness, medium plus bodied"
5035,Birth Of Tragedy,99,Porter - Imperial,9%,5.0,"Hill Farmstead is plain and simply the best brewery I have ever been to. I would say that it is the best of all time but who really knows? Everything I have had from there, I'm not sure if you could find anything wrong with it."
5036,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.06,"Semi-clear filling to hazy dark orange with a khaki blanket that fizzles out quickly to nothing. It's pretty wild how drastically de Garde beers vary from one to the next, even within the same The series. This one's ultra funky and oaky up front, then finishes quite sour. The funk is woody and a little cheesy, like blue with walnut and cashew, as the bright peach accent brings in some pear and overripe sweaty ass fruit under a hot sun. The prickly medium-light body swallows sharply sour and oaky, finishing dry."
5037,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.35,I got a couple of bottles of this beer from my brother-in-law. It poured an opaque dark with an ecru ring head that is not leaving much lace. The scent had coffee flare with bourbon highlights. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with espresso and roast base with subtle chocolate and bourbon presence. The mouthfeel was fuller in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is an excellent beer.
5038,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.4,A: The beer is cloudy yellow in color and poured with a short white head that left lots of wisps of lacing on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
5039,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.66,"2018 vintage, on tap in a 10oz flute. Carbonation is subdued and the beer only has a very slight ring of dark brown head. Drank side by side with a Jamaican Speedway - these beers are quite easily distinguished in appearance and in taste, which surprised me a bit. I've had quite a few of the Speedway variants now and they all have their own very unique traits. Barrel Aged Speedway has quite a lot of bourbon to the nose and taste. The coffee is rich and roasty, but not strong and lacks any acidity. The barrel is also quite present with a light, woody dryness. To this day, I still think that Rye Vietnamese Speedway is one of the very best beers in the world - and bourbon barrel aged Speedway isn't far behind it in quality. I'd like to see what some age would do to this beer (but not too much - I had a 2013 recently that was tremendously oxidized)."
5040,In Perpetuity,100,IPA - New England,6.7%,4.44,"Pours cloudy, bright gold with a 3 finger dense white head with great soapy lacing. Aroma has nice orange blossom notes, some more piquant notes too. Fairly sweet and floral. Taste has a more pungent punch to it up front, a bit hot with stone fruit tang that settles into a pleasant, more mellow citrus in the mid taste and finish. Feel is very soft but peppery and hot, especially in the aftertaste. This is just fantastic. Rich and tangy but with a solid backbone of citrus mellowness that keeps it balanced."
5041,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.89,"A: Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing S: Lots of tropical fruit up front along with some citrus and stone fruit. Very juicy T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of tropical and stone fruit, then picks up some juicy citrus and super light bitterness. Stone fruit lingers (mostly peach). Finishes with tropical juice M: Medium bodied with low-moderate carbonation. Soft and fluffy O: Another killer DIPA from the green line. Super fresh, super juicy, super fluffy. An absolute must-try"
5042,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.55,"2019 bottle. 12oz, 11% ABV. The pour is dark and viscous, poured cold so allowed room to warm, so not much of any rising head or visible carbonation. A thin beige ring surrounds the top of the beer in the glass. A huge chocolatey aroma reminds me of brownie batter, with a nice underlying complexity of molasses and dark fruit. There's a roasty malt character to this as well, but that initial chocolate dessert sweetness really wins the day on the nose. A fantast contrast in the flavor profile brings out a ton of barrel character, as well as a much stronger emergence of those dark fruits and molasses characteristics. The barrel brings out additional flavors of vanilla, oak, and bourbon, and roasty dark coffee begins to grab a good bit of influence as well as it warms further. In the finish its all bourbon, with a familiar boozy spice on the tail. Warming, smooth, viscous. As it slips down the back, there's a good level of residual mouth-coating, and does well to accompany a boozy burn down the hatch. Definitely would consider a full-bodied beer, and drinks like more of a 14+% BA stout, in all the best ways possible."
5043,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.94,"I'm going to have to check what I gave Doubleganger, as it is still my favorite, but this is darn close. The hop bill is just amazing, and I like the flavors on the nose. Orange, mango, even a hint of peach, with absolutely full body."
5044,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.91,"A jet black pour with a fast tan head. The nose is insanely good-Sunday morning breakfast at grandma's with waffles, syrup, and bacon in a bottle. The drinking hits with sweet chocolate malts upfront, a smooth flow and a semi-dry finish. On the sweeter side of the spectrum but its not over-kill. There is a lot going on here. Big flowing flavors of sweet maple syrup, soft coffee grinds, and subtle smoke. Additional notes of vanilla, brown sugar, cocoa, and caramel. A rather moderate mouthfeel that offers a lush, rich, and creamy feel. Nothing to off-putting in terms of chalk or cola flavoring.  Overall, just a crazy good porter."
5045,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,5.0,"I normally don't rate anything all 5s, but this is hands down the best BA Imperial Stout that I've ever had, adjuncts or no, and side by side with KBBS it blew it out of the water. This beer is phenomenal."
5046,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.75,Aged for about one year in the bottle. Very dark appearance with minimal tan head. Aroma is a nice coconut and bourbon. Taste is also a nice smooth bourbon and coconut.
5047,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.65,"original batch drank on 4/30/2017 L-thick dark black, minimal head, a little bit of lacing S-vanilla, milk chocolate, and oak with the boozy bourbon coming through with power. Not getting the cocoa nibs that FO brings through so nicely. T-follows the nose, but the boozy bourbon is pretty intense. The vanilla is somewhat hidden under the bourbon. F-semi-creamy and definitely does not drink like a 16%er. Probably 12-13% would have been my guess. No heat at all either. Overall - I definitely like FO better, but I LOVE FO more than just about any beer I've had. I would have liked more vanilla to come through, but there certainly is a nice vanilla presence. The boozy bourbon is strong, but in a very good way. Incredible beer, and one I think will age well."
5048,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,5.0,"By far my favorite IPA. The fragrance is out of this world: yeasty, citrus, and overall super fresh. Taste is slightly bitter upfront but finishes aromatic and soft on the palate. I cannot wait to try more of Russian River Brewing Company’s stuff"
5049,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.0,"650 mL bottle. Black body. Smells of peppers, bourbon, chocolate, bourbon, and a little maple. This thing is aggressively spicy. More than the regular bourbon. Chocolate. Bourbon. Maple sweetness and lingering spice. Heavy and sweet. A little boozy. I prefer the regular bourbon over this. A little too sweet and even though it's much spicier, it doesn't elevate it."
5050,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.49,The beer is a hazy yellow/orange color with a small white head and a bit of lace.
5051,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.64,"Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2016 vintage. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a fat mocha head that fades to leave a creamy blanket and and light lacing. S - Big aromas of fudgy chocolate brownies, caramel, bourbon juice, nutty notes. The coffee is really faint but all other notes are super pleasant. T - Taste is similar to the nose with excellent fudge brownies. Nice nutty notes. Great chocolate. The coffee is super faint but the bourbon is phenomenal. Really rich fudgy bourbon juice. Delicious. M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, smooth, creamy, silky, alcohol hidden very very well. O - Overall this was a very very good stout. Excellent chocolate and bourbon notes, unfortunately the coffee is super faint due to the age. Still, delicious! Serving Type: bottle"
5052,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.5,Batch 6 --- poured into a HF Tulip 
5053,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.48,16 oz can from egrandfield!
5054,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.77,"Good runner up to the Original Prairie Bomb. Pours a very dark, opaque brown-black, with a thin tan head. This stout strikes with coffee first, then chocolate and boozy-vinalla. Less complex Taste than the original prairie bomb, with a thick full-bodied mouth feel. Disguise the booziness more and your Prairie Bombs will go straight to the top of the beer cult classic list"
5055,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,3.25,"Disappointing in that it tastes more like a wine than a beer, but that’s the point. It’s white grape residue that would serve better in a wine glass than a beer mug."
5056,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.5,2008 vintage.
5057,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,3.98,"Vibrant garnet with a thin, white, slightly pink blanket. Smell is really strong funk, horse blanket and cherry. Taste is really smooth cherry pie filling, fresh cherry skin, with light vanilla and cinnamon running in the background. Very dry."
5058,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.42,"Canned 8/16/18; drank 8/26/18 @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Opaque yellow appearance.  Minimal white head; minimal lace.  Pineapple, peach & faint dry grass notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Pineapple, peach & fresh spring water flavors up front; faint dry grass notes on the finish.  Refreshing & pleasantly dry; delicious!"
5059,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.76,"Not surprisingly this beer delivers on its' purpose. It is pretty sweet (to me) but it's supposed to be. Rich and thick. Coats the mouth and hangs around. The most impressive part is how they send a wave of each flavor across your palate. No joke. Finishes strong with strawberry. Not a lot of bourbon barrel to come through, but it's there and a nice compliment."
5060,The Rusty Nail,100,Stout - Oatmeal,13.3%,4.5,The combo of brewer's licorice and the cinnamon is new to my taste buds (both flavors are noticeable in this beer) and they go very well with the stout and bourbon. Well done!
5061,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.93,"2012 sticker poured into a fluted glass. While this beer is visually striking with a lovely raspberry scent, the taste and mouthfeel are the stars here. Fantastic balance of funk, fruit and sour. Even a hour after opening there is still huge carbonation. A complete joy. One of the best beers I've ever had."
5062,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.57,Look - thick slightly orangish yellow with a slight white head and lacing
5063,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.79,"This was a fantastic beer. Best enjoyed as a dessert beer after a fine dinner. The hazelnut flavor rings through and walks hand-in-hand with the coffee flavors. Light hints of chocolate in the after taste remind me of nutella. The feel is perfect, it is smooth like a creamy cappuccino. This beer is perfect for rapping up a fine evening."
5064,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.21,"Bottled 1/6/21 This is a legendary beer that I honestly haven't paid much attention too. Pretty widely available too, so it's a shame that it's taken me this long to get around to it, but at least I'm having it now! Let's jump into this beast Pours a lightly cloudy golden amber with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves patchy lacing, carbonation bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass There's a definite balance in the nose between fresh, vibrant hops, and sweet chewy malt. I'm picking up on aromas of oily pine, pithy grapefruit, crackery malt, some earthy spice, sweet honey, and grassy hops The balance continues into the taste, but leans more into the bitter side of things. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting fresh cut pine, tangerine, pale malt, and lemon rind. The swallow brings notes of pale malt, light toast, orange zest, and floral hops A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet dry beer that is quite refreshing for the abv. Finishes mostly dry with aa decent sweetness While this is good, it did not come anywhere near the average on here. I suspect the high rating reflects much older batches, as I've heard this has changed a lot over the years. Oh well, I'm still happy I had it"
5065,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,3.76,"I'm just not one for spicy beer. I've tried a few different years of this one and I just can't get past the bite of that spice. I know that's the point of the beer, just not my thing."
5066,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,3.38,Syrupy stout with a feel that completely coats your mouth and never surrenders. It's insanely sweet and the barrel aging does little to counteract this. Was extremely excited to try this and severely let down. Not sure why it's rated so high to be honest. Almost tastes like a wine/liqueur than a beer.
5067,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.1,Love this one. Simple and to the point. It's fairly easy to obtain which is an added bonus. Stouts that are this simple and available are in a class all their own.
5068,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.67,"Hazy yellow body with a white head and lacing. Lemon, orange pulp, some lime, mango, honey and dank and dry hop aromas, more potent than the orignal yet softer. The taste is stupid, gets so much juice and intensity from the smell plus pineapple, grapefruit and melon, sweet, bitter, dry, juicy, tropical and citrusy, a feast for the taste senses. Feel is soft, hazy to the max, potent yet crushable, could use a touch more hop texture variety but I'm nitpicking. Amazing"
5069,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.96,Great beer that lives up to the hype. I honestly expected this to fall short of expectations and because it’s hard to get...I was hoping the hype train was wrong.  Right there with Heady Topper.
5070,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.29,"Pours amber with an off white head. Citrus, pine, bitter herb, sweet malt.  Pine, grapefruit, orange, floral notes, sweet candy. Finishes with a dry oaky flavor reminiscent of nuts,"
5071,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.31,Not a sour guy
5072,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.13,"Light pink, strawberry hue"
5073,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,3.81,"Can @ Monkish. Cloudy copper beer with some white foam. This one still has a pretty dank, oily, resinous hop character but is a bit more well composed, as compared to its little brother, Alter Ego. Plenty of citrus, some pine, and a bit of tropical fruits. Definitely a bit of malt sweetness here, and some sweetness of pineapple and peach. A nice enough offering."
5074,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.51,"16oz can dated 2/9/18. Pours cloudy gold with a moderate head of white. Minimal retention or lacing. Extremely hoppy and pungent in the nose. Quite dank with strong notes of melon, grapefruit, peach, mango, white grape, and pear. Medium bodied with a creamy, almost chalky mouthfeel. An assault of hops on the palate. Grapefruit pith, hard peaches, garlic, and oily weed. Zero malt, quite bitter, and very dry. Finishes with lingering, pithy citrus and some throat warmth.  What a bruiser of a hop- bomb and certainly the hoppiest Trillium I've tried."
5075,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.59,"Had this plenty of times but finally getting around to reviewing. Appearance is copper with a finger and a half of creamy white head. Aroma is juicy, hoppy goodness. Mango, grapefruit and more. Taste is a nice balance of the same, with a medium level of bitterness. Nice full mouthfeel."
5076,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.55,"Direct from the brewery, this beer is packed with Brett. So earthy, and crispy to the taste. There's a slight bitter edge in this one, and it's pure almost like from Belgium."
5077,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.77,"2019 vintage poured from a 12oz bottle into a stemmed taster glass. pours inky black with virtually no head. smells of chocolate cake with vanilla frosting dipped in bourbon. one of the best smelling beers i’ve yet to encounter. taste is similar with big chocolate cake and vanilla flavors with the whiskey barrel on the finish. typical TG stout mouthfeel, which is to say full bodied and nearly perfect for the style. i am admittedly not a big straight vanilla stout guy but i was blown away with this beer. the vanilla is integrated so well that i don’t pick up on the dark fruit flavors that i’ve gotten with past assassins (purple through green). this is vanilla frosted bourbon cake in a glass. delicious!"
5078,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.31,"07/15/21 on bottom of can. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint. A: Slightly hazy light amber with prodigious 2-finger off-white frothy head with a pillow of foam laying on top and craggy thin stripes of lacing. A stunner for sure. S: Aromas of marijuana, lemongrass, leafy hop, black tea, and herbal honeysuckle dominate but leave plenty of room for some grapefruit and pineapple to sneak through. There are some lighter caramel notes as the beer warms. T: Flavor is excellent but isn’t as intense as many other DIPAs but has nice honeysuckle, herbal, marijuana, and tobacco flavors with some fruity grapefruit, pineapple, and pine resin. Light caramel malt flavors are light but apparent. Bitterness is moderate-high with low esters and mild cherry alcohol flavor. M: Dangerous medium body and very dry finish.  O: Bodhi is a classic Midwestern DIPA with light caramel notes and herbal, dank, MJ hop character with milder fruity grapefruit and orange flavors. Intensity was a bit less than expected. Still a very good DIPA especially for those who love the dank."
5079,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,5.0,This might be the first sour worthy of a 5. The signature mouthfeel of Casey with that acidity of Side Project. This peach explosion is sheer perfection.
5080,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.88,"A dark gold, orangeish color that I've only seen otherwise on Mylar Bags. Aroma was consistent with the taste, which was a deep sweetness followed by a nice bracing bitterness. Very fruity and complex. Thick, creamy feel. As good as it gets, at least the batch I had."
5081,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.43,Lived up to my high expectations. A bright pink color in the glass with a modest white head. Aromas and taste lined up with bright raspberry and cherry bathed in complex funk. There was a mineral quality to the beer that complimented the flavors.
5082,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.41,"Upon entering the pearly gates and making myself at home, just after I wake up and saunter to the kitchen for breakfast, I imagine this is what Miranda Kerr would be juicing me. A bouquet of super dark fruit and red wine for days are met by a perfect lip puckering punch. Does Raul say hallelujah for Sang Noir? I think he does."
5083,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.61,"Not much more to add. This beer not only tastes amazing but, arguably, smells even better. Nothing more finer than cracking a fresh can and taking a big waff of the hop freshness. Truly one of the best beers out there."
5084,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.47,"Appearance: poured jet black with very little head. The surface looked slick and oily. Noted sediment dispersed. Smell: a lot to pick up from! Hazelnut coffee and some black licorice candy. Also tons of vanilla and then bourbon at the finish.  Taste: Cloyingly sweet throughout. There is ton of vanilla, burnt sugar, black licorice, and dark chocolate. Also a mocha coffee with a sharp whiskey finish. Mild maple at the aftertaste. All the flavors are blended well into a masterpiece. Mouthfeel: very syrupy and viscous.  Overall: this is a big beer. Very glad this was split with another friend. It's a 500 ml bottle but half is more than enough. Pretty serious beer, no idea the alcohol content but I don't buy that it's 10.70% ABV on BA."
5085,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.18,"Pours coal black with a bigger, beige head, soon receeding to a thicker lacing atop the glass. Smells of dried raisins, glazed caramel and layers of milk chocolate among spicy, old oak. Got an additional coffee punch to it, bringing toasted hazelnuts and dried blueberries to the nose. Has a soft, smooth mouthfeel among a complex body, exhibiting a long lasting booze dryness. Tastes of charred malts, which brings chocolate covered coffee beans to the palate, offering a wooden note, which then brings the spicy barrel up. Has a whipped cream quality, soothing the warming, not yet biting oak barrel, creating a pleasant, spicy peak among coffee and coals. Finishes heavier on the coffee and whipped cream interplay with additional licorice and sweet caramel, amped up by a long going alcohol glow. Very well balanced, smooth and decadent stout, featuring a great, subtle coffee presence."
5086,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.35,"2014 version poured into a snifter. I'm generally a fan of the Eclipse variants and this one, for me, does not disappoint. This version is well balanced. As others I am sure have noted, these beers don't come cheap but the quality warrants trying a version once in your life."
5087,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.34,I want to say that this feels like hop mash in my mouth. This is a chewy fellow. Since Zombie Dust has been available in this area I have been picking it up whenever I see it. This will make it into that rotation.
5088,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.92,"To celebrate our big dog Bronco's return to health from a severe illness, I am drinking this very special Belgian Gueuze, Oude Geueze Vintage 2016 from Brouwerij 3 Fonteinen, ABV 7.30%. This is a top notch Gueuze and I think it is even more delicious than the regular Oude Geueze from 3 Fonteinen. It is heavenly. Look: Golden with a finger thick white head Aroma: sweet and tart fruit, wine and oak Taste: The flavor is sweet pears, green apple, lemon, wet oak, white grape, white wine, some delicious funk. It is tart and dry and complex but it is not too tart and dry.  Body/Overall: light to medium body."
5089,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.55,"This beer lives up to the hype. All of the ingredients are discernible but aren't overpowering. Nice notes of maple, mocha, and cinnamon. Medium+ mouthfeel. Minimal booze. Awesome."
5090,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.84,"Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger brown foamy head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating around average time but on the faster side for an imperial stout. It settles into a layer on top and leaves minimal spotty lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, hot fudge, soy sauce, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, light oaky or charred wood notes, cocoa powder, molasses, dark fruit like raisins and dates, vanilla, piney hops, black coffee, milk chocolate and then booze like a dark rum or smoky bourbon. It's sweet but not cloying or over the top, allowing the bourbon notes and hops to straighten it out for a degree of balance - a beer this big is supposed to be roasted malt and booze dominant and it is, but the fruit and chocolate nuances make it wonderful to inhale. Tastes simple, rich and maIty yet at the same time very complex with dark chocolate, hot fudge, soy sauce, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, light oaky or charred wood notes, cocoa powder, molasses, pumpernickel bread with raisins, dark fruit including figs, raisins and dates, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, black licorice, espresso, tobacco and some herbal/earthy notes. Fair amount of bitterness which blends well with the general malty and barrel influenced sweetness, char and rich boozy flavors. The bourbon is not dominant like Founders KBS or Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout, but it is involved with every aspect of this beer and adds a positive bourbon barrel influence across the board.  Mouthfeel is super smooth and velvety, with mild carbonation, a heavy body and feel that is almost thick and viscous. A meal in a glass if you will, this has a very mild bourbon burn, a kiss of bitterness and then a ton of fruity, roasted malt and chocolate sweetness which fades with woody bourbon notes. To me it's perfect for such a big beer at 12% ABV.  I had been seeking this out for a year or two and finally got my hands on a few bottles, and this bottle lived up to the hype even at this early stage of it's BBA stout life. I wish it had some more in your face bourbon, but the subtleness of the bourbon as is now is a wonderful accent which keeps jumping out like a ninja. A fantastic imperial stout, I loved it."
5091,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.35,Blend 3 august 2015 Golden burnt orange. White head.  Huge sour and tartness with a big apricot fruit flavor. It has a nice funk and very barnyardy. Definitely tastes like JK funk. Lemon acidity.  A very solid apricot sour. Very enjoyable.
5092,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.65,"Wow, I was expected to be let down on this but it exceeded my expectations. You get the coffee & maple coming through with a thick mouthfeel and perfect sweetness, not overly sweet."
5093,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,5.0,"drank while enjoying the Browns v Chiefs game, at least for three quarters... This beer lives up to its reputation, very hop forward with lovely bitterness and floral notes"
5094,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.52,"16 ounce can, canned on 3/16/2021. Served in a Teku, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with about an inch frothy white head that stayed around for a long time. There's lots of lacing, too. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like mango, pineapple, bready malt, orange, tropical fruit, grassiness, pine and vanilla. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some white pepper, peaches, grapefruit, herbal and honeydew melon flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew, seems like I pick up another flavor with each few sips. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Easy enough to drink. I thought this was a pretty good overall brew, sure this was the first OH beer I've tried and I wasn't disappointed at all. Will definitely try more of their beers in the future if I'm able!"
5095,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.39,"2017 & 2018 batches were as good as advertised. Not a stout, but close to that with complexity . Not coconut suntan lotion, but just enough balance. Certainly they are best fresh, not +1 year aged."
5096,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.31,"Cloudy orange with two fingers of foamy, antique white head. Great retention and super thick lacing. Candied grapefruit in the nose. Some tropical flowers and light grass in there, too. Wow. Cakey, bready, sweet taste — reminiscent of an unnaturally airy and fluffy pineapple upside down cake. Passionfruit. Pineapple. Strawberry. Doughy popover. Slight grassy bitterness in the finish. Really nice. Soft feel with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. Definitely very sweet, but a “soft,” doughy sweetness rather than over-the-top, sickly sweetness. A real treat."
5097,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.3,"Bottled 16 June 2017: Pours clear gold color with a 2+ finger white foamy head that seemed like a cloud on top of the brew, dissipating slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing, most of which slides down quickly. Smells of barnyard funk, wet grass, a muddy trail and then honey, toasted grains, fruit notes like peach, lemon zest and a very acidic juice like grapefruit juice or sour orange juice. Complex for sure, but everything is muted and even with the funk, fruit and earthy notes interchanging with each whiff. I get floral notes as well after a few minutes. Tastes of tart fruit like sour white grapes, green apple, lemon zest, red grapefruit, orange peel and then comes funk and what could be brett, along with yeast, dry flowers, peppery spices, rose pedals, honey, wet cardboard or musty bread, some more trailing funk like the smell of wet animal hair and then a dry trailing fruity aspect. It's very complicated and bounces between tart and funky, but the malty base brings sweet grainy notes it that cuts the sourness and allows more fruity flavors to come through. Hard to put my finger on everything that I taste as it's mostly what's listed above with flavors that resemble ginger ale and white wine. Very easy to drink considering the tartness at points. This is a style I need to explore more to build up my appreciation."
5098,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.97,"Can from Tfontana, thanks for the opportunity!"
5099,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.66,"2011 sticker. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Cantillon stemmed tulip glass. Acquired in a trade. Pours a dark orange, pumpkin colored body with a big white head that reduces fairly quickly but leaves a nice layer or retention and some lacing.  Decanted and allowed to warm.. aromas of oak, funk, barnyard, hay, cedar, citrus, lactic.. aromas are potent and waft through the room, much more inviting than regular gueuze, definitely more wood character! Taste is fantastic, upfront a light tartness with heavy oak, quite woody, citrus and tons of funk all mingled together, mustyness on the follow through, finishes dry and funky. So delicious. Medium-low carbonation, easy drinker, medium light body.  The increased wood and oak character of this really puts it ahead of regular gueuze and honestly all other gueuzes i've had in the past. Truly world-class."
5100,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.42,Had on tap at KRBC. Unremarkable head at beginning...but stunning rich amber honey color... and outstanding lacing. Full hop aroma and a citrus bomb for flavor. So clean and drinkable. Reamarkabke easy for an 8% DIPA. Definitely built in the malts perfectly. Yep... lived up to the hype.
5101,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.91,"2016 vintage enjoyed on 12-31-2020 Wonderful smell, taste and mouthfeel. Super smooth and silky tasting the bourbon cask vanilla, nice coffee mixed with chocolate and what seems to be oats (there are no oats in it) send it over the top. Amazing. 2021 vintage enjoyed on 3-18-2021 Again, wonderful smell taste and mouthfeel. Heavy oak vanilla, loads of dark malt and dark fruit, pick up the booze along with dark chocolate, tobacco and a malty bitterness. As it cellars, it is only going to be more amazing! Will probably reach a 5 in an update."
5102,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.77,"Batch 2 bottle poured into a Side Project wine glass.  Pours a super pulpy, bright, glowing orange body with a frothy white head that leaves nice lacing and retention. Beautiful looking beer.  On the nose are heavy, potent apricot aromas, like a freshly sliced apricot. Bright and fresh, grassy, hay, with a sharp acidity and citrus aromas. Taste mirrors the nose with a sharp but not cloying punch of stone fruit sourness mingled with apricot puree and citrus. Funky and pulpy stone fruits on the follow through. A bit yeasty on the finish. Crisp, medium body with medium-low carbonation. One of the best stone fruit sours I’ve ever had."
5103,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.89,"Drank on 6/11/2018. 11oz pour. Silver wax bottle. This was set out for 25 minutes before drinking while the pour took roughly an hour to consume.  Look-motor oil thick just like the other TGs. Tons of lacing, especially as more gets drank. Remains continue to coat the sides of the glass. Tiny mocha colored head Smell-exactly as expected, dark chocolate, boozy bourbon barrel, hint of vanilla, some oak, a little molasses and caramel Taste-follows the nose quite a bit. Tons of barrel and bitter dark chocolate. Really and incredible depth of flavor. Even some toasted caramel, like the top of a crepe brûlée and a hint of tart chocolate covered cherry as it really fully warmed.  Feel-incredible. The finish is just amazing as these flavors linger around in the best of ways. As much as there is some booze on the nose, there’s no heat whatsoever. Extremely smooth and easy to drink.  Overall-definitely lives up to the hype. Probably the only time I’ll get a pour like this one again. Absolutely fantastic."
5104,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.85,"bottled 7/21/17, consumed 9/2/19 wow, there is a lot going on here. cherry skin, minerality, earthy must, woody oak quality, mellow vanilla sweetness, vinous quality of red wine, musty grape skin. wet earth, herbaceous and slightly floral, rose petals. very mellow aciditiy hinting at some bright fruity qualities of tart apple and lemon. overall this one has a ton of depth but drinks really easy. a wonderful treat!"
5105,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.69,Very dark appearance with tan slight tan head. Aroma is malt with vanilla and coconut. Taste is also a coconut and vanilla with a slight rum taste with a significant alcohol aroma. A little more aging would help.
5106,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.26,"Pours jet black with a big, bubbly mohagony colored head, collapsing to a thick ring of lacing. The smell of roasted coffee defines the nose on this, gently enhanced by lighter notes of milk chocolate and earthy peanut butter.  Drinks incredibly smooth with a huge creaminess to it, with a medium body which sermingly appears to be heavier, due to the great mouthfeel in this.  Taste is of chocolate covered peanut butter, which then gets overruled by bakers chocolate, melted toffee and roasted, almost bitter coffee. Continues to get sweeter then with maple syrup and caramel, still playfully balanced by the roasted coffee and a note of licorice. Finishes creamy and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation to create a lighter refreshment, coating up maintaining maple syrup, toffee and chocolatey coffee beans.  This is a nice, well balanced sweeter porter with a very well working roasty, coffee driven edge to it."
5107,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.24,This one is THICCC! Very dark and a strong boozy smell. Initial punch of booze and toffee up front and finishes nicely. This is a big one so definitely not on to tackle on your own!
5108,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.71,"From 04/14/12 notes. Big thanks to Brad for busting this one out at our DC Epic Sour Tasting. Got to try 2 versions of this next to a normal 2010 Cable Car. The first was an unlabeled version that was allegedly dubbed ""too sour"" and not released. The second was the labeled version available at Toronado. I enjoyed both but thought the normal labeled version was much better, so reviewing that one. a - Pours a murky pinkish red color with one inch of off white head and moderate carbonation evident. s - Smells of sour tart, cherries, sour dark fruits, spices, cinnamon, yeast, and some light earthy notes. Really awesome, a ton of cherries. t - Tastes of sour cherries, tart dark fruits, spices, fruity malts, funk, floral and earthy notes. Taste is a little fruitier then the nose. Really awesome taste, super tart and fruity. Perfect for me and a kriek. m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Crisp and easy to drink. Really nice. o - Overall I thought this was an amazing beer; I preferred the labeled version and think I preferred it slightly to the normal Cable Car. A ton of tart cherries and soem light spice, this is one of the best krieks I've ever had. Hope they have this at Toronado when I eventually make it out there."
5109,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.33,"Bottling date - September 27th, 2018 Pours a hazy beautiful golden. Funk, lemon zest, hay on the nose. Maybe some unripe peach as well. It's lightly tart with a mineral note on the finish. There's some stone fruit character as well. The minerality is kind of copper penny like which I've experienced in other beers that feature the Drie yeast culture. The minerality's prominence is not something I've experienced in other bottles. I started this review ready to declare this one of the best slept on (for Drie) lambics out there based on previous bottles I've had. I am not going to do that at this moment. I'll update this if I open other bottles that reflect the greatness I've previously uncorked."
5110,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.67,"Getting some fruit. Great non-adjunct barrel-aged stout. Never thought I would see or try this beer. Not sure how my friend procured this, but glad to try it!"
5111,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.77,"Pours a beautiful orange juicy color with a fabulous big head. Aroma is different but really inviting. Not really juicy but hoppy is my best guess. I think I smell some malt in those hops. It tastes different for this style as it lacks any sweetness. I get citrus, grapefruit, passionfruit and maybe peach texture as it's mouthfeel is creamy smooth and lacks any bitterness so this is on helluva blend. I can see how tasters rate this very highly. It's awesome and reminds me of some other beers as this is my first Julius. I hope it's not my last. Special Thanks to my BA @TastersChoice Larry C for sharing this very awesome beer. A 16 ounce can dated 02/12/21 ""IT MIGHT AS WELL BE WRITER'S BLOCK"". My first TREE HOUSE. Two-Thumbs Up!!"
5112,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.5,"One of the better beers Ive had from trillium (non IPA). While their sour game is on point, you cannot snooze on their one-off beers like this. Wish I had more than 1 left of these bad larrys."
5113,Medianoche - Coconut,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.1%,4.5,"Many thanks to tacosandbeer for this amazing bottle!! A - Dark brown / black pour with no lacing and small flakes of coconut floating in the glass. Very viscous and oozes down the sides of the glass like syrup with lots of legs. This beer even gives a brown hue on the sides of the glass ... NICE!! S - Complex aroma with coconut, roasted sweet chocolate, light char, a little bit of alcohol. For almost 14% the ABV is well hidden on the nose.  T - Toasted coconut is steady from start to finish with sweet boozy chocolate, some char-like roasty-ness and alcohol presence that never overwhelms the beer. M - Thick, syrupy, velvety, very sticky on the lips, slight warming on the way down. O - Big and flavorful, this beer is nothing short of amazing. Period."
5114,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.43,"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Aroma is lemon, herbal and some tropical notes. Well balanced. Flavors of citrus, a little pine and some melon and other tropical notes. Awesome pale ale."
5115,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.68,"Super excited to try a BA version of one of my favorite beers, let alone a maple barrel version! Smell takes on more of the flavors from the original: cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, hot peppers, cake breadiness, black strap molasses, slight dark fruit and smoke, plus then the bourbon and wood from the barrel, maple is there but faint. Not as pure smelling as original, but heavier. Taste is incredible, so much complexity, take all of those aromas from the smell, add smoky maple, caramel, and rich malt work. Finish has good kick from peppers, plus counters the sweetness and robust barrel well. Feel has the spice, has deep richness, has robust barrel elements, sweet adjuncts, and some graininess too, just so much goodness. An amazing beer, apparently I rated the orignal higher, but honestly for me they are equals, just depends on your mood"
5116,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.72,Bottled 10/24/18
5117,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.43,"Pint can poured in to a nonic glass. Can is dated 05/14/20. Look- Murky golden orange color w/ a slight greenish tint, decent off white head that quickly recedes to a thin foam cap, minimal lacing. Little to no carbonation streaming as it sits. Smell- Huge citrus (tangerine, grapefruit and lemon), tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, papaya and passion fruit), nectarine/peach, a bit of melon and berries, bready malt, little pine, some herbal/floral notes. Taste- Seriously juicy citrus and tropical fruit, nectarine and peach skin, berries, some dank melon, grainy malt, negligible pine and some other herbal/floral hop notes. Feel- Medium/light bodied and fairly dry and crisp, somewhat sweet and sticky up front with a lingering slightly bitter finish. Moderate/light carbonation on the tongue. O- Except for the appearance, this is a homerun. Very crushable at 6.6%, more like an IPA than a pale ale."
5118,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.51,"750 ml bottle shared with my wife, poured into a snifter. Bottled Oct. 2018, best by 2038 (!). Pours a slightly cloudy straw yellow with a smallish head. Aroma and flavor are very funky with oak, citrus zest, and a hint of sweet buttery vanilla (in a good way). Complex and delicious."
5119,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.09,"A big thanks to Dan for this one. Served in a snifter. Reviewed from notes 10/7/14 Pours minimal head. Beer is pitch black and opaque. Lacing is spotty and sparse but the legs are slick, oily, and coat the glass nicely.  Aroma is a roasted malt, smoke, chocolate, sweet soy sauce, prunes and peat. Robust and very unique.  Opens sweet soy sauce, prunes, raisin, and other dried dark fruit. Notes of chocolate, roast, cocoa and peat emerge towards the middle complemented by a distinct anise, wood and tobacco flavor. Really unique and nicely complex.  Medium bodied with low carbonation. Slick and smooth in the mouth and silky going down. Moderately clean finish with a slightly lingering aftertaste.  A good beer but one that you have to go into with a certain mindset. Unlike any other imperial stout I've ever had and certainly worth trying."
5120,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.45,"Golden, slightly hazy with no visible cardio and a finger of white head. Smells of pineapple, citrus and a hint of pine. A Caramel malty backbone follows.  Tastes of perfection in balance. Fruity and floral almost like a rose, lily of the valley. Caramel sweetness with a hint of bitterness like grapefruit pith. Medium body with a little spritzy carbonation. Covers the abv. Having on tap at Liquid Gold, San Francisco, Dec 30th, 2018. Amazing brew. The feel is powdery and amazing, the taste so soft yet defined so that it finishes quickly on the palate, leaving you craving the next sip."
5121,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.9,"Pours opaque black with a dark brown head. Not as much lacing as you might expect. Chocolate and booze on the nose. Malt and coffee in the background. That ""barrel aged"" smell is prevalent but really pretty well balanced. It just smells delicious. Huge flavor. It's big and boozy, but also a nice bitter, malty backbone. There is a hint of sweetness but I certainly wouldn't call this beer sweet. I don't get much of the coffee flavor personally. I'd say the chocolate flavor is the stronger one. But bittersweet chocolate. The barrel flavor is there in the start and the finish but not overwhelming. It just gives the whole thing a nice edge and a long, warming finish. It's full bodied and just a tiny bit viscous, but not at all syrupy. Just right for washing around your mouth for maximum flavor.  There are other exciting barrel-aged stouts out there but for balance and just perfect execution, this has to be one of the absolute best."
5122,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.94,Can cross this whale off the list! Mouthfeel on this beer is outstanding. If you have a chance to sample or get this beer I highly recommend it for sure!
5123,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.49,Great jwb collab drank on 1/6/17 Great beer here. Tons of coffee and a nice addition of vanilla. Milk chocolate with a creaminess from the lactose. Not super thick but medium feel. Easy drinking for 13%. Really enjoyable stout. Barrington coffee is excellent
5124,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.27,"Great BA non-adjunct stout. Did a share somewhat recently of 20 Barrel aged non adjunct stouts, and while this one was more hyped than most, it was middle of the pack. Dont get me wrong, very good, but worth the hype?"
5125,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.35,"Slightly overrated IMO. This stout is on the high end of the cinnamon war, so if that's your thing - you must try it. No too sweet, I'll give it that. Otherwise I've found many more balanced brews in the category, such as Coffee Cinnamon Bourbon Abominable by Fremont. Hunahpu is worthy of a try and of forming your own opinion, but you may also not find it up to the hype."
5126,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,3.95,"Bomber from Albertsons. Pours out jet black, thin beige head disappears. Nose is bit confusing, as there is so much going on. Taste brings it all together, Mexican chocolate, cinnamon, coffee, barrel notes and a bit of warmth from the alcohol. Sweet and ashy."
5127,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.4,"Canned 2/15/21, ""I have read a book about me reading the book I am reading"" stamped on the bottom This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego, which is one of their only flagship NEIPAs that I have not tried yet, so I can't draw any comparisons there. However, I have had Doubleganger, the extra hopped variant of this and enjoyed it quite a bit Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing There is a perfect blend of tropical fruit and dank herbal hops in the nose, quite unlike any beer of theirs or any IPA really, almost an earthy perfume vibe that oddly reminds me of the smell of a church. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, creamy peach, juicy papaya, pithy grapefruit, grassy hops, dank herbs, a bit of onion, and doughy malt to hold it all together Herbaceous vibes from the nose translate well into taste but with less intensity, allowing for greater balance which bumps up my rating. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy papaya, mango, overripe grapefruit, light pine, and a creamy malt. The swallow brings notes of herbal hops, creamy malt, tangerine, and underripe cantaloupe A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a very creamy beer that coats the mouth on the way down. Finishes somewhere between dry and slick This one was interesting for sure. Way more herbs than I usually get in a TH beer, and for uniqueness alone I have to bump up the overall score. Really good stuff here!"
5128,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.43,2016 version thanks to JohnnyHops. 
5129,Oude Geuze Vintage,100,Lambic - Gueuze,6%,4.73,"09/2015 - So minerally, oaky, lightly floral, and full of funk on the nose; more minerality, funk, and barnyard on the palate; the body is pillowy, effervescent, flavorful, and clean; wow!"
5130,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,5.0,"Truly one of the best sours out there. Hard to get your hands on but worth the price. Unfortunately, when you get a pour or bottle it does not last long. I had this at Side Project bar in early 2017, visiting a friend in St. Louis. I believe it was the second batch, good haze with a bright orange. Had a sweet complexity of peaches that developed into everlasting funky, earthy, acidity that beckoned another sip. Must try if you are a sour lover."
5131,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.48,2014 ventage - Very dark appearance with thin dark tan/brown head that desipates quickly. Aroma is a complex fruity with a hint of bourbon. Taste is very smooth bourbon and fruit without any hint of alcohol aftertaste. The aging is well worth the wait.
5132,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.22,"2014, split with rudzud No real head a touch of fizzy bubbles, thick dark pitch black motor oil with legs that seems to go to Tahiti and back. Nose big boozy syrupy malt, candy syrup, chocolate syrup, fudgey, little biscuity cookie expensive Belgian chocolate, fluffy nougat, tons of coffee syrup, very little rum, candy fruit, little bitterness, no real booze, rum get more candy molasses fruit thing as it warms. Taste brings more rum up front, candy syrupy molasses and candied dates, syrupy molasses, big candy malts, dark malts, little roasted, coffee syrup and caramel, back into mild cookie dough and fudgey dark chocolate, little cocoa dust, little vanilla, a bit of a cheap rum or cheap syrup, fluffy nougat too. A fusel alcohol, not super boozy but fusel and bitter flavor. So much candy, yet a dry mildly boozy finish, candy notes, more cookie dough and dark choc, molasses sticky candy, fusel alcohol. Mouth is thick syrupy fudgey, lots of fusel alcohol hot booze, decent carb. Overall eh, an ok beer, the barrel didn't round off the fusel alcohol at all and added strange syrupy molasses thing. Pretty much a let down."
5133,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.56,"An unbelievably huge thanks to Chris for this one. You are a saint, sir. Thank you.  Batch 5 - poured into a balloon stem at 45°F.  Great big hiss when opened. Pours an inky coal black, sitting like black coffee in the glass, with just a hint of deep brown sheen on the top. A collar of coffee bean bubbles form, before quickly simmering down to nary a ring. Nose: I can smell this from across the table. This thing is crazy. A Tsar Boma explosion of maple galore, like a Canadian pancake house with an industrial sized syrup spill. Beneath that, or rather, beaneath that, a big heaping batch of fresh Ethiopian coffee - lightly roasty, bold, fresh, and warming. The actual beer base is just oozing with caramel, brown sugar, chocolate fudge, vanilla cupcake frosting, and a big rich nutty note with hazelnut spread and praline. There's some dark fruit character, but purely in the form of blueberry pie filling and candied plum. A whisper of tiramisu cinnamon, marzipan, and fresh waffles. This is a beautiful aroma. Palate: Mornin' Delight greets the palate deliciously sweet - almost perfectly so, and just unfurls with a maple intensity that is difficult to describe. This is like rustic, dark, grade B maple syrup boiled down and barrel-aged, lending a sweet, smoky maple fudge character, and less like Aunt Jemima, reported in batch 2 and batch 6. Nevertheless, this is still candied maple, lending a parallel thread of pure butterscotch. The coffee begins to open up, and almost eclipses the maple, lending a necessary roasty bean quality to cut through the sweetness. The coffee is fresh, smooth, and bold, with absolutely no acrid, bitter, charry, or pepper qualities. A dark chocolate-covered espresso bean note takes centre stage, with a maple silhouette, and some dried blueberry, Almond Joy, dark toffee, and Madagascar vanilla bean notes play in the background. A nutty malt note emerges, and the sweetness begins to rapidly subside - concluding with roasted malts, hazelnut, Ethiopian coffee, chocolate blueberries, malted milk balls, and the reminder of maple syrup, just managing to dry out. Mouthfeel/Body: TG did well here. For how big and decadent this beer is, it isn't syrup. There's some very good effervescence for a 13% ABV stout, cutting through the full body. Rich, hefty, and creamy, but not quite chewy or viscous. It is quite sticky around the lips, though. The roast and coffee manages to lend just enough dryness in the finish to escape a cloying fate - mimicking very well the effect of oak tannins. Not difficult to drink. Overall: This has always been a hype stout, and now I fully understand why it gets that praise. In fact, I think by and large, it deserves it. Even ignoring the maple and coffee additions, the stout itself is fantastic. Big, sweet, and so well rounded, with some nice sweet blonde notes. The fact that this is so rich, sweet, and hefty, yet never fights back or feels like a chore is a testament to its pedigree. You don't even care that it isn't barrel-aged. This is The Real McCoy imperial breakfast stout - it just has that special something that separates it from the rest, and I encourage any fan of the style to seek this out and try. Absolutely thrilled I got to enjoy this."
5134,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.94,"10 May 2020 - Beer #90 - BA Top 250 Alert! Corona Day #59 Acquired via trade Appearance: 4 - a glowing apricot orange. Not too much action on the bubbles. Head sticking around, but looks a tad flat. Nose: 5 - SOUR! Hopefully sourer than the last apricot sour I had. Taste: 5 - definitely sourer than the last one, and bursting with apricot flavor. Whereas the Abricot du Fermier had the barnyard funk on the back end, this one has it up front with the apricot. A variation on the same style. Both delicious. Mouth: 5 - so acidic and bubbly it almost hurts. Overall: 5 - outstanding. I think it's ever so slightly worse than the Abricot du Fermier, but still world class. Cheers!"
5135,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.93,"Thanks to JLindros for sharing this bottle. It's a batch 2, a gift to the two of us for working The Festival in Portland. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice darker brown hue with a great one finger lightly tan hued head that faded to leave great bubbly lacing and a thin halo. S - Big aromas of burnt sugar and caramel. No real alcohol on the nose at all. TONS of dark raisins and dark fruits, glorious cognac barrels and flashes of oak. Great sticky raisin aroma here, super aromatic. While it smells like a vintage beer there is no oxidation. T - Taste is phenominal. Enormous raisin flavour as well and flashes of chocolate. Exellent cognac barrel notes, sweet, dark fruits, vanilla, barrel oak notes. Loads of almost burnt sugars, little bit of toffee and caramel. This is just exquisietly crafted as far as flavour goes. M - Mouthfeel is super is lightly carbonated, creamy, smooth, slightly sticky. There is no alcohol. O - Overall this was a phenomenal beer. There is exquisite cognac notes, lovely dark fruits and creamy barrel. There are incredible characteristics here and with no oxidation in a beer that's 5+ years old....amazing. Serving Type: bottle"
5136,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.47,"I waited in line on Memorial Day for 45 minutes to pick up a case of this. Canned on 5/28. First impression: Quite good and very drinkable. Nice balance of hops and citrus. I think I prefer the more bitter mouth feel of Heady Topper, but this is a really great beer."
5137,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.77,"Canned a week ago, tried alongside an equally old can of Juice Machine L -- Deep amber-orange haze in the glass with 2+ fingers of sudsy white head produced with moderately aerated pour. Lovely retention and lacing. Looks about as perfect as Green and VG"

5139,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.68,"Sweet Jeebus, this is one intense, delicious beer. It should come with a disclaimer as it's a barely wine disguised by a clean and beautiful golden body with a shit ton of hop aroma. Beer sugar like with a citrus hop bombardment, with a sweet then bitter feel. Rich with alcohol presence well established, but not overly fusel.  This is a dangerous beer. Wonderfully executed and over the top without being pretentious. Cheers"
5140,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.58,"batch 2 drank at side project on 3/28/2016 this is overall a fantastic beer. this is a phenomenal showcase of an apricot fruited wild ale. it is a tad on the ""too sour"" side, but that is only if i have to nitpick this. really a beautiful beer and one I am glad to have tried. wonderful levels of oak, apricot, some other citrus notes, and acid. lovely beer"
5141,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,5.0,"This beer is a masterpiece in the triple IPA category. It's 10.3% ABV, and drinks like any other of their DIPAS. Amazing look of dark orange juice in the glass. Super cloudy.  Smell is addictive and balanced, strawberries, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, lime zest, just an awesome nose.  Taste is incredibly balanced for such high ABV. Alcohol is well hidden and the hops really stand out all the way through. Hints of orange, grapefruit, kiwi, pineapple, cantaloupe, unripe strawberry and lemon/lime zest. Mouthfeel is typical trillium DIPA, creamy, medium carbonation, dry finish.  Given how smooth yet complex this beer was for such a high ABV, and a date on the can, there is nothing much else to say other than this beer nailed the style of a TIPA. An incredible offering worthy of celebrating 5 years of IPAs by Trillium."
5142,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.33,"This is one of my fav style's of beer and I was very much looking forward to this one after stumbling upon a bottle while looking for something else. I had heard the hype and was excited to try it. I'm not going to say it disappointed me but it certainly did not live up to the hype. Again , not a bad brew but not worth the price point and not up to the talk. Nice aroma and coffee/chocolate are there but kinda weak IMO. Being in Jersey maybe I'm spoiled by Kane's Porters/Stouts - which are clearly superior - but this one didn't do it for me."
5143,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,3.81,"Bottled 2/6/15; drank 3/13/15 @ the Yarchives.  Hazy dark orange appearance.  Big eggshell head; a curtain of tree-rung lace.  Medium mouthfeel.  Grapefruit & orange citrus flavors up front; a dry, bitter finish.  Mango notes emerged as this warmed.  Nice taste save for the brutal bitterness. Too much for this timid soul..."

5145,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,It's nothing short of absolute perfection. It's like drinking a liquid velvet smore complete with campfire smoke. Love the stuff just wish it wasn't so impossible to get ahold of.
5146,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.48,"Bottled 2/16/21. L: Pours clear golden, with visible tiny bubbles rising from the bottom like champagne. Short big-bubbled white head sticks all around the glass. Nice splotchy lacing. S: Pine forest, flowers, and citrus. All noticeable but not strong. T: Bitter pine up front, smoothing out with floral and citrus notes midway, then back to a piney/hoppy punch that dries at the finish. F: Medium mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation. Not soft, but right for the style. No alcohol heat. O: As advertised. The standard for west coast double IPAs. The early and late piney hoppy bitterness is almost perfectly balanced by the citrus and floral notes in between."
5147,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.7,"Canned 8/20. Dank, resinous pineapple, grapefruit, and mango just absolutely crush the palate. The lingering, prickly stickiness is so damn satisfying. As with everything else I've had from TG, just so damn good... Every time I go beer shopping it seems I find something fresh from these guys. So glad to have them in PA. So damn good..."
5148,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.74,"This beer is pretty damn difficult to distinguish between it and PTY. Seriously. For years now I've been just skipping the big line at the DIPA fest for PTY and just getting Notorious with no line, the beers are almost indistinguishable.  Has a pretty color that is a mixture of both orange and gold, comes with a 1/3"" head.  Aroma is delightful. All that hop noise under the nose, usual descriptors of awesomeness, pick whatever tropical, stone and citrus fruits you want, mix in those pine/green/dank descriptors on top of it.  Taste, wow, hop bursting, not overly aggressive ibu number, mouth feel that hides all the alcohol, super dry finish, like damn this is light on its feet but so damn huge.  There are so many 10+% double and triple ipas these days, PTY no doubt was the innovator, but there are some damn good substitute goods out there (Notorious, Ephraim, Waldo etc. . . ) it really makes waiting in line seem dumb when you're this far down the rabbit hole."
5149,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.21,"For me, it does not stand above other neipa’s and ct style ipas in the manner I see so often described. Its very good beer but I don’t think its the best treehouse beer that I’ve tried. Definitely gives off Orange, tangerine even warping into mango. Its certainly luscious bodied and big... but it did not blow me away. But... when you’re expecting “the best beer in the world”... its not really fair to the beer, or your expectations. Excellent beer."
5150,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.35,Reviewing the 2021 edition which is 10%ABV. Pours a murky orange with a small head and lacing. Smells of pungent floral hops and citrus. Tastes of tart citrus with some pineapple sweetness. The finish has hop bitterness with some alcohol warmth. As the glass warms the hop bitterness diminishes and the sweeter tastes come out. Medium heavy body with light prickly carbonation. Lightly syrupy mouthfeel. This is a big bold edgy brew.
5151,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.68,Dark brown/black with two plus fingers mocha head.
5152,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.36,"Can (one off from De Bierkoning) @ home, 24 days after canning. Murkey yellow golden colour Somewhat frothy off white head. Aroma's of dank hops, onion, resinous bitterness. Retronasal it's somewhat sweet, (very) dank hops, resin, juice. Flavour is moderate sweet with light bitterness. Medium bodied. Good carbonation. Long finish, light moderate bitter and orange soda (?). Great stuff (and a good burp)."
5153,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.75,"The roast profile on this beer is almost unbelievable before even considering it's limited at 7.2% abv. Bittersweet chocolate, city dark roast coffee grounds, and charcoal suggests a grittiness that swirls within a medium-full body that never cloys nor removes focus from the flavor. Tough to tell where roast ends and hops begin, both giving tremendous depth of flavor.  I am most impressed with the light smoke/kindling character that comes through subtly on the finish, almost just an olfactory sensation. It really takes the roast flavor and overall experience over the top. In the style, I've had nothing that comes close"
5154,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.5,"This was my unicorn beer for a long time, I probably had unrealistic expectations going into this, but for me, while a very good beer, it did not live up to the hype or the price"
5155,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.4,"Look: Orange, clear with 3 inch fluffy head. Highly carbonated."
5156,Very Hazy,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.49,"16oz can dated 11 /27/20. Pours cloudy yellow with an inch of white fluff. Plenty of smeared lacing with persistent retention. Dank, piney, and juicy in the nose. Weed with grapefruit and unripe peach. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Dank, resinous, citrus on the palate with minimal malt and a drying bitterness. Grapefruit, tangerine and cracked garlic. Finishes dry yet juicy and dank."

5158,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),99,Stout - Russian Imperial,10.5%,4.03,Bottle date of August 2013.
5159,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.73,"A 750ml bottle at the brewery. 2013 sticker, bottled on 10th September 2015. Poured into a Cantillon tasting glass. Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy dark ruby red with a three finger dark pink head and sparse lacing. Aroma: Marzipan, cherry and almonds dominate with hints of biscuit. Only some light sour tartness. Taste: Cherry and almond dessert cake. Very nice. Light sour, tartness, oak and a touch of sweetness. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall: Another stunning Lou Pepe variety with great balance. Easy to drink and refreshing. I tried Framboise on the same day and not to take anything away from the Kriek as it is still really really good, but the Framboise was near perfect."
5160,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.7,"12 ounce can into a snifter. Canned 10/10/18, had 10/28/18. Pours a dark ruby, a little cloudy, with no real head and a little light, foamy lacing. Aromas of bourbon, malt, tobacco,figs, plums, raisins, caramel, light oak, a light spicy aroma. The flavor pretty much follows the nose- bourbon, figs, plums, malt, tobacco, caramel, oak, some dates and brown sugar, light molasses, a hint of cherries. Smooth, a great fuller body, well carbonated.  This is truly one of my favorite beers ever. Incredibly expressive aromas and flavors. Every sip gets better as it warms."
5161,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.37,"Pours fizzy apricot and cloudy. Smell and taste are all big citrus zest, tart apricot, some pulpy orange and blood orange. Feel is a bit fizzy, but works with the zest. Tasty, palate cleansing. Great beer"
5162,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.69,I had the 2020 edition. Poured from a bottle into a snifter glass. 
5163,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.63,"Poured from fridge temp but allowed to warm a few degrees. Pours a gorgeous opaque orange with barely any head (on an aggressive pour). The nose is mind-blowing. It's bursting with fresh nectarines. Also getting a good amount of orange creamsicle. A touch of tartness and some sour patch kids. Also getting a hint of leathery funk. The taste is amazing and nicely matches the nose. Again, nectarines dominate, and I love nectarines! Definitely some sourness upfront, but not mouth-puckering. Definitely getting some vanilla ice cream, a bit of wheat, and maybe a hint of orange peel. There is a nice tart-funkiness on the aftertaste. This is just a wonderful beer."
5164,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,3.69,"In a can, 6 weeks since being packaged. Some pine, maybe a hint of whiskey and leather, some citrus but not a juice bomb. The mouthfeel was pretty heavy. The overall flavor had a slight astringent note to the immediate finish. I’m not tasting the same world renowned brew that has been exalted here, but I would pay $12 for a six again, just not the $15 I originally paid."
5165,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.75,First batch I had was in the fall of 2019. I wasnt a huge fan but recently had pours of the fall 2020 batch at the brewery and was blown away. Much better than what I remembered.
5166,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.4,Clear deep gold with a touch of red. One finger of dense cream color head that forms rings of lace as the level drops.

5168,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,4.92,"A collaboration review with my brother. 750 ml bottle. Date on the bottle is 5/7/18, which we assume is the bottling date. Appearance: ruddy brown like apple cider, cloudy, initially effervescent but the bit of foam dissipated immediately. Smell: Fruit dominant, sour cherries, raspberries. Earthy. Taste: Whole lotta berry, tart, vinous/acetic notes. Lingering red berry aftertaste. The blending produces a profound complexity. Hints of sherry and caramel.  Mouthfeel: Thin to medium body, low carbonation, slightly astringent Overall: A master class in Flemish Red Ale production with the added bonus of aging with sour cherries, raspberries, and cranberries. This style, famously called the ""Burgundy of Belgium"" by Michael Jackson, sets a high bar for beer blending and complexity. Bursting with flavor, a towering brewing achievement."
5169,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,2.77,Big barrel and a decent nose. Wood forward for sure but thin and boozy like a not so thicc barely wine. This is not something I need to seek out again though. Definitely overrated in my opinion and undeserving of a top250 list like this.
5170,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.0,"Side Project makes wonderful beer and this is a good one; it is not a 100 point beer. The nose, balance and flavor profiles are all ""fine."" Yes, that's it - just fine. It is somewhat balanced but also light on fruit and a bit thin. Yet, very pleasant, inviting and drinkable."
5171,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.74,"2018 vintage. Really excited to find this at the brewery while visiting Portland. As expected, absolutely no sound when the cap was taken off. Zero carbonation, which immediately seems strange. Pours a gorgeous dark brown. The nose is incredible. Reminds me of a 30 year old English barleywine. Tons of oak, caramel, alcohol-soaked cherries, leather, sweet molasses. This, to me, smells old and delicious. Taste is crazy. Immediately picking up strong nutty flavors. The lack of carbonation conveys a syrupy taste. Picking up lots of dark cherries, blackberries, toffee, burnt wood bitterness, leather, rubber, oak, and maybe a hint of soy sauce. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick - very bold. Overall, this is a mesmerizing beer with a deep hierarchy of flavors. Absolutely fantastic, and an experience I won't forget."
5172,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.0,"Poured from a 375 into a tulip glass  Look: Pitch black. No light going through this beast. Thin mocha colored head.  Smell: Maple, bourbon, and a bit of soy sauce. There is a strange note here I get on about half the sniffs and it smells like dog food.  Taste: Big maple candy on the top, walnuts, bourbon, vanilla, oak, and dark coffee.  Feel: Big and viscous. Low carbonation. Clings to the palate. Medium alcohol. Mild bitterness. Medium sweetness.  Overall: A well brewed beer that I can only finish slowly and not the whole bottle. Split it between some family members. The dog food nose was a bit off putting but the beer itself is excellent."
5173,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.39,"Bottle. Poured a hazy yellow color. Aroma was bright, rustic, funky, and tart with some wet woody/cork. Flavor was still much like regular Arthur but a bit more intensified and with a wine and wood addition. I haven't had Arthur in a while but it stills seems rather closely tied to Art; not an absurd transformation. I love the farmy/rustic quality that Hill Farmstead's farmhouse beers finish with. Really delightful."
5174,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.75,"Poured into a 20 oz giant tulip glass bottled 3/13/2020. Pours midnight black in the dead of a cloudy Winters evening, with a massive 2 plus finger mocha head that leaves a few thin streaks of lace, as it slowly settles into a thin layer of mocha bubbles. 4.75.  Smell is deep dark fudge, vanilla beans, roasty coffee grounds, cinnamon, and some oaked bourbon. 4.75 Taste follows dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, cinnamon, and a little bourbon lingers sip after glorious sip. 4.75 Mouthfeel is BIG, a tad dry, gentle carbonation, and at 10.2% it drinks bigger, but extremely approachable and complex. 4.75 Overall this is one I have always wanted to sip and thanks Ocalafox for sharing. A very impressive brew. 4.75"
5175,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.54,Pours a mostly clear yellow orange with two fingers of white head 
5176,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.61,"2019 vintage. Released a couple weeks ago. A: Pours black with a sparse dark brown head that dissipates rapidly to a tight ring. No lacing and minimal retention. S: Dark cocoa, a little anise, loads of vanilla bean, light roast, moderate dried plum. "
5177,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.69,"Look: super hazy light yellow orange with a light white head Smell: slight acetic acid, some oak and a lot of peach  Taste: its a tart sweet peach bomb  Feel: crisp, tart and clean  Overall the best sour ive had to date... now to try westly"
5178,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.55,"2017 vintage  Pours black with a thin dark tan head. Aromas of bourbon, roast, some sweet vanilla and fudge. Maybe it's a bit thin, but not detrimental to the beer at all. Flavor is really well balanced barrel, roast, and some chocolate and vanilla. Doesn't fall short in any aspect, leaves nothing to be desired. Very much enjoyed this one."
5179,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.42,"After giving my palate (and liver) a few weeks to rest while on my diet, im treating myself to can of Three Floyd's. Canned on 9/28/20.  It pours out a paler shade of topaz or amber. A nice foamy finger of head appears. Solid retention and a nice spots of lacing. A really good looking brew. Nose is this clash of pine and fruit. Mainly peach and grapefruit. Peach comes through almost like syrup or nectar while the grapefruit brings a bitter citrus note. Scents are aggressive and bold, but not obnoxious.  Taste is pine, peach falls back a bit, grapefruit, a touch of lemon, and a hearty malt backbone. Mild caramel notes from the malt pair up with the peach sweetness to engage in mortal combat against the bitterness of pine and grapefruit. Aggressive and unapologetic, but yet somehow still balanced. Lines are drawn, trenches have been dug out, and No Man's Land is the taste buds. A great tasting brew, but definitely not for everybody. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild to medium carbonation. Smooth and drinkable, unobtrusive.  Overall a great IPA. Strong bitterness kept in check by the malt. 10.5% hidden very well. Usually bigger IPAs burst through with a lot of booze on the nose, but this one stays restrained. A great offering by 3 Floyds."
5180,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.93,"This is worth driving to Waitsfield for. I worried it was a gimmick, not different from Sip. It's better than Sip. which I already like a lot. It's more more more compared to Sip. Nice job Lawson's!"
5181,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.74,"Pours black with one finger of khaki head that recedes to a thin collar with minimal lacing. Smell is mostly dark chocolate and bourbon with hints of vanilla and dark roasty coffee. Taste is a well balanced blend of dark roasted malts, cocoa, hazelnut, espresso, and smooth bourbon. Very nice layering of flavors that hit all the right notes for the style. Body is slick and silky smooth, but I find myself wishing it was just a bit more full and chewy. As great as the flavor is, I wish it hung on the palate a little longer.  All in all, another tremendous barrel aged offering from Jackie O's. While they never disappoint, this one is especially great."
5182,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.79,"It has been a few years but I had this beer in Europe and, by luck, in the US as well. I was in a bar in Amsterdam and asked if they heard of this and the bar keep said ""ya,"" but could not carry it. Not willing to drive up to the abbey and get one case. But, he said, there was one place in the city he knew of that carried some bottles. ""Where?"" A block down the street. I bought the last two on the shelf. Try and find it."
5183,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.58,"A real stand out at our tasting. So much flavor packed into this little beer. Intense fruit from the nectarines that comes off as a real juicy quality. Acidic and tart, but not overpowering. Very fresh and clean. Much preferred this to Fuzzy."
5184,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,3.89,"22oz bottle - review from notes I really want this on-tap. Slight haze, white cap, smells like lemon zest and danks. Tastes follows the smell, and this drinks like a double IPA at only 6.8%, so much hop packed into a small package.  I *really* want this on-tap"

5186,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.53,"Draught: this one pours a murky, golden color. There was a wisp of a white head and some lacing. Nice nose! Grapefruit, tropical and citrus hops. The taste is very good. A faint bitterness, and lots of juicy hops. They blend together to make something that is just excellent!"
5187,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.49,2020 release
5188,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.39,"4 year old aged (2016). Appearance is amazing with a nice brown head and lacing. Aroma as well. Chocolate, coffee. Taste is a little bitter and more coffee centric, even for a 4 year old, it’s quite bitter and overly toasty. It’s good, but I guess I’m hooked on the pastries."
5189,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.39,"2020 bottling; consumed on 10/23/20 Pours an inky jet-black body topped with multiple fingers of creamy, fluffy, pale mocha foam; spectacular head retention fades steadily to a half-finger of rocky cap and brooding, frothy collar, along with layered gobs of thick, sticky lacing ringing around the walls of the glass with longevity. Aroma begins with coffee, dark chocolate, and undertones of maple candy inextricably fused upfront and foundational to the bouquet; hazelnut, vanilla cream, and waves of lush dark fruits mesh with roasty maple and the subtle earth of roasty malts over the middle, developing towards a finale highlighting blueberry jam, fresh prunes, and burnt butterscotch to close. Taste offers a slight coffee character giving way to a silky maple-forward profile upfront as roasty malt prickles the mid-palate and blueberry compote and bakers chocolate develop; a lingering hazelnut and vanilla cream again form in tandem through the finish with a plummy lingering resonating past the swallow. Mouthfeel brings a medium body, lightly charry with an encroaching sticky texture upfront, along with a moderate fluff of pillowy carbonation; mild-moderate roasty char lingers past the mid-palate through the back end and cuts the oily slickness for a finish narrowly dodging syrupy textures. Drinking well below the weight of both its ABV and the robustness of its adjuncts, this stout remains airy and fluffy in texture, and despite the more Aunt Jemima-styled maple, is balanced effectively with ample coffee and a soft, roasty malt base; a firm foundation in brewing while adjuncted evocatively with a sense of time and place (big-time early morning diner vibes), which alone emphasizes a masterful quality of the style."
5190,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.64,"Really good, probably the best New England style IPA I have had. Juicy, citrusy, tangy, fruity, smooth, and enough bitterness to not be sweet, an awesome beer all the way around. Often I don't like mosaic, but this is great. I hate to jump on the hype train because that's not what I do, but this beer is simply awesome."

5193,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.33,Tasted from bottle. Blend #2. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Big sour funk aroma of lacto with peaches. Taste is very sour. Flavors of peaches with lactobacillus. Very nice peach flavor with a lot of pucker.
5194,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.78,"Would I buy this again? Yes - Id be in for the full allotment. Overall exceptional beer.  Walnut forward taste with nice spicy-heat backbone.  Not much head retention which let me down some and smell was nutty and bourbon-y, but spices arent immediately present."
5195,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.75,"2017 vintage drank on 7/8/17 this beer is the real deal and not overrated in any way. It's about 6 months old and drinking incredible. The coffee presence is fantastic and some age would not necessarily hurt this either. It was a pitch black and thick and creamy beer that came fully loaded with the flavors. The barrel is perfectly present. Nothing too complex, but by far one of the best coffee ba stouts out there. Elite!"
5196,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.6,"Galaxy is not one of my favorite hops - I'll be honest and just throw that out there. That being said, there are things about galaxy that I do like quite a lot. When combined with other hops, it tends to be a smorgasbord of sweet, clean, rich haze. Cutting Tiles delivers in spades - it's almost too sweet, but it doesn't quite cross that border in to syrupy, which is good - I cannot abide that in an IPA. The beer is still plenty drinkable and doesn't have that filling quality that I hate. The bubble gum/cotton candy tasty that many attribute to galaxy is not all that forward - it's there, but not offensive or overwhelming. I'd generally prefer a Fort Point - but this specific variant of Cutting Tiles is quite good."
5197,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.71,"First pour from the 750ml bottle is clear golden yellow with bubbling effervescence and a nice foamy white head even after several years aging in the bottle. Further pours produce a hazy cloudy appearance. The aroma is clean with light banana, hay, straw, honey, lemon, apricot, apple, pear, vanilla, doughy bready malt, some barnyard funk, horse blanket, hints of clove spice, peppercorn, apple cider, and floral earthy hops. Tastes tart, slightly sour and vinegary with apple cider notes, lemon, apricot, apple, pear, banana, hay, straw, honey, vanilla, clove, peppercorn medley, horse blanket, barnyardy funk, bready doughy malt, and floral earthy hops. Feels medium bodied, smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a really great and complex saison."

5202,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.05,"Random preface - Birthday beer. It's a 2016 I've had Cellared for 10 months now but am eager to try it after recently having black tuesday. The aforementioned being an almost transcendent experience slow sipping over several hours. I didn't quite imagine my birthday being as boring as today was when I took a vacation day for tomorrow... but alas I'll make sure it wasn't in vain by facing this monster of a beer. L - Teku pour. Remarkably lighter than expected. Very thin given the massive beer it is. Head dissipates quickly to all but the outer edges. The lacing runs fast and falls like rubbing alcohol on the sides of the glass. S - black tuesday. Partially roasted coffee, bourbon and oak. Loads of vanilla. It's incredibly dense and potent smelling. Im getting more raw oak out of this beer than maybe any other I've ever whaffed. The coffee is surprisingly subdued. There's something off though and I'm fighting the urge to believe this may be slightly soured. T - hot. And sour. Well fuck my birthday and waiting a year to drink this. M - who care O - depressed. Fuck turning 31. (Original ratings of look 4, smell 4.25, taste 1, feel 3.75, overall 1)"

5205,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.39,"2019 vintage. Typical black appearance, not much head. Smells great, bourbon barrel, mild coffee. Flavor was great, lots of thick chocolate and bourbon notes. Not a ton of coffee but it was so good that who cares?"

5207,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,4.15,"Thanks to Harrison8 for this one. Blend 2. 12oz bottle poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a cloudy straw yellow color with a head of tight, white bubbles that were dissipating quickly as the beer poured. In fact, there was no head left even as I finished the pour. Obviously, there was no lacing. But, the sound of the effervescence from the carbonation was amazing. i could hear the beer from arms length. The aroma was a pleasantly confusing mixture of grains, yeast, funk, some floral notes (hops?), grapes, and maybe some oak? Wutever, there was plenty of goodness going on. On the tongue, similar scenario: so much going on, it's hard to describe. Every sip gives a different perspective. some very nice tartness. The body was light and crisp, with a very dry finish. Drinkability was awesome. i couldn't decide if I wanted sip it, or slam it. If I had two bottles, I woulda done both. Overall, a great beer. A must try if you get the chance."
5208,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,5.0,"This beer absolutely deserves the hype. In fact, this is the best beer I have ever tasted. I agree with most of the previous favourable comments re its taste, smell, mouthfeel and absurdly quaffable nature (particularly given the 10.2% ABV) but I would also like to add that I completely agree with those who recommend a 12-16 degree (celsius) drinking temperature. This means you take one out of your cupboard/safe/bank vault and put it in the fridge for only 15-20 minutes...the complexity really comes through at this temperature. In contrast, a friend once drank a cold one as a 'travel beer' on the Tube (Subway/Metro) on his way home at midnight (when heavily drunk). Obviously he is no longer a friend. In summary, this beer tastes like an angel's vagina and anyone giving it less than a 4.9 are just upset they've had to acquire it for $20 a bottle from a dodgy character on a street corner at 2am rather than from a happy monk at the Saint-Sixtus Abbey."
5209,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.39,"Pours out hazy yellow orange. Color of pineapple juice. Small ring of carbonation.  Smell is pineapple jumping out of the glass. Some mild plant/floral hop presence.  Taste is strong hop flavor but without the bitterness. Pine, pineapple, green vegetable, peppery, grassy. Any bitterness is extremely short lived. Minimal malt profile.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild/medium carbonation. A nice smoothness with some density.  A solid IPA. It carries a strong hop profile without a lot of the bitterness. A unique take on the style."
5210,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.78,"Sent by the very generous @jvgoor3786 in a recent box of goodies. I poured from the 12oz. can into a 12oz. snulip glass. The pour is slick dark brown like used motor oil. It leaves a small layer of creamy tan foam in it's wake. Smells like bourbon, char, ripe dark fruit and molasses. The taste is very bourbon forward followed by dark roast/coffee, burnt brown sugar, fine tobacco. There's a slight sweetness that offsets the bourbon that is wonderful. The feel is oily smooth with noticeable alcohol warmth.  It's been a spell since I've had a straight up barrel aged stout that wasn't overwhelmed by pastry ingredients. This reminds me of the early Bourbon County and Black Note years. It holds its own and brings a pleasant plethora of sensory delight without being overwhelming. This is the closest I've come to rating a 5 in a long time. World class and something I'd hoard if I had access to it!"
5211,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,3.34,"375 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Very hazy orange body. Small white head. Strong apricot aroma. Oak. White wine. And immediately the taste is incredibly sour. The sourest apricots I can imagine. Overwhelming. Really great apricot flavor, but it just gets so sour. Just a bit of oak and white wine remain. Low carbonation. It’s good, but so sour. Completely covers up anything else going on."
5212,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.47,Yellow hued with a very murky complexion. There’s a fingernail of eggshell white on top. Heavy lacing. The aroma is of earthy hops and green veggies. I taste earthy hops and green veggies. The mouth is velvety smooth.

Toffee, a hint of peanut brittle, and plenty of chocolate. Nice bitter chocolate on the taste to balance out the sweet toffee, vanilla, and maple. Nice graham cracker, roast, and coffee, too. Well done all around. Another solid beer from Toppling Goliath."

5216,Ground State,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.4%,4.54,"Pours a big black syrupy light blocking brew that looks like blackstrap molasses with a thin cappuccino cap. Head only on aggressive pour settles fast into thin tan collar. Aroma burst forth with boozy bourbon barrel, bittersweet cocoa, and sweet maple. Hint of vanilla pushes through as it warms. Flavor is full of maple, smooth bourbon, flash of sweet vanilla followed by bitter baking cocoa. Booze isn’t hot, but you can tell it comes in pretty high on the ABV scale. Body is smooth as silk, light carbonation, syrupy and full. Rich boozy dessert. A great brew, big and bold. Perfect for sipping on a cool evening by the fire (or a vacation day breakfast)."
5217,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.54,"If citra is your thing, this is where you want to be. Super juicy. An awesome example of this hop's flavor, highlighting it with a nice medium level of mouthfeel. The head is not overly eager and fades fairly quick to a ring around the edge of the glass. This is much smoother than the regular GITM and an improvement on that beer in every way."
5218,Maman,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.68,"2018 batch served in teku. Shared among friends. Thick and syrupy pour, deep black, tiniest amount of light shines through edges of glass when you hold it up to natural light. Mochachino head settles into thin bubbly collar. Aroma has layers of varied chocolate forms including sweet fudge, bittersweet baking cocoa and dark chocolate. Roasted malts, some dark fruit and a hint of boozy barrel. Roasty and rich, loads of chocolate, smooth boozy barrel flavor melds perfectly with the brew. Earthy wood layer, some earthy and floral vanilla, sweet toffee. Sweetness and dark fruits come out more clearly as it nears room temperature. Full bodied and smooth with a bit under moderate carbonation. Excellent. I hope to try other batches to compare."
5219,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.74,"On tap at Hops & Pie(10/2017). Black appearance with a small tan colored head. Pleasant aroma of light chili peppers, chocolate malt, vanilla, cinnamon, light oak and a touch of whiskey barrel. Similar flavor, rich, malty and moderately sweet with a lightly spiced bitterness. Medium to full body with soft carbonation, a smooth feel and a balanced finish. An excellent sipper overall."
5220,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.35,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2018 vintage bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a minimal spotty lace cap. Minimal lacing with some clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Lightly increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Very mild herbal/roast/char bitterness and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark bread, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, light smoke/char/pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and slightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is amazing. Mildly increasing warmth of 13.5%, with no barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV; with the very mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Insanely rich malt complexity, with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy/tannic on barrels. A highly amazing offering, and top tier style example as expected."
5221,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,3.72,"500ml bottle, 2017 release, poured into a Hill Farmstead 6oz tasting glass. Enjoyed on 12.10.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a jet black color, thick and viscous with a thin finger of khaki head but no retention nor lace. The aroma is nice, smooth bourbon barrel, dark bittersweet chocolate, light coffee roast, a bit of green pepper detracts from the aroma a bit but there is a lingering smokiness as well. The flavors are good, lots of bitter dark chocolate, light coffee roast, rich bourbon and dark grains but as it warms, an unpleasant onion and green pepper flavor appears and is amplified by the smokiness of the beer. The mouthfeel is very good, super full bodied, coating and creamy with a rich and velvety texture and a smooth finish. Verdict: A decent barrel aged coffee stout from Hill Farmstead. The green pepper sensation is certainly unwelcome, but there are enough other elements to the flavor profile that it doesn't completely ruin things."
5222,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.79,"This is simply a fantastic BA stout!!! Bomb! is super well-balanced, but the barrel aging process seemed to really bring out the vanilla in the vintage we tried, which can be a bad thing if it's not good vanilla but this seemed like high quality stuff. Wish I had more"

Look: pours black with brown foam, good carbonation Smell: dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, but mostly very boosy. Taste: chocolate and vanilla, but again the booziness overpowers everything. The balance is missing on this one. Mouthfeel: bit thin body Overall: Overall very boosy, balance is missing. In this case batch 1 definitely was better."

Dirty brown water is what it looks like to me. Smells rich and inviting, with a very faint hint of barrel aging. Damn smooth, with an English barleywine flavor, and once again a hint of barrel. Alcohol is insanely hidden. Was happy to get the chance to try this."

5230,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.71,"BIG thanks to my new friend Vermonthiker for generously trading this one to me! This was one of the better BA stouts I've had in some time. Really fantastic beer. Happy to share this with my best friend and brother. Unfortunately, the Blackhawks sucked in Game 1 and didn't make this experience complete with a win as we hoped. This was our first Hill Farmstead offering and it did not disappoint!  Bottle date 6/2013  Pours as a stout should, black as night and no signs of light getting anywhere near this ferocious beast. A beautiful espresso colored head forms and disperses into a solid ring and lacing that stays until the last drop. NOSE BOMB! Wow, still a ton of bourbon in the nose with this much time. Was really taken back by the aroma on this. Tons of deliciousness; bourbon, chocolate, caramel, vanilla,oak and malt. Flavor matches the nose with more tongue coating mouthfeel than I was expecting. Lots of sugary sweetness on the finish. Overall, this is a beauty. Really impressed with this beer and how well it sat. Vermonthiker...you're awesome! Trade with this man!"
5231,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.79,"2019 vintage on-tap in Garden City; served in a snifter. A: Poured like the finest of barrel-aged stouts; jet black & opaque with a minimal khaki head. S: Sticky sweet bourbon, caramel, vanilla, and coconut; impressions of coffee and chocolate as well; sweet and faintly boozy. T: My goodness this is phenomenal; bourbon; coconut; chocolate fudge; Almond Joy candy bars; coffee with sweet cream; espresso...more caramel and vanilla; so good. MF: Thick, fudgy, sticky, full, minimal heat. O: Its a beast of a brew but the sweet flavors meld so well, and the underlying impression of alcohol heat binds together the flavors well. This is a top-5 all-time beer for me."
5232,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.83,"Poured from a bottle- not quite clear golden honey color with white head leaving bubbly lacing. Nose is piney with sweet floral notes,aroma is obvious as soon as bottles were opened. Taste follows with a fine hop balance and a moderate bitterness. Finish is very smooth -this is a fine brew that disguises the abv with flavor."
5233,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,"Can poured into stemless teku. Orange, hazed, thick off white foamy head. Deep and layered hop aroma, punch in the nose of fruit/earth/resins. Layers of tropical fruit flavors with resinous, grassy, earthy hops. Citrus zest and rind. Moderate carbonation and medium body, soft. Great mosaic flavors."
5234,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.01,"I CANsider myself very fortunate to have been the lucky winner of a buncha CANs in a recent lottery on a different social media site. I merely had to pony up the cost of shipping, which was modest, in return for a buncha CANs for The CANQuest (tm)! I had heard of & was certainly aware of Trillium B.C., but I have not been trading in a while & so I did not give them much thought. I am now interested in drinking & reviewing the entire Small Bird Series, especially Pipsqueak Penguin & Stumpy Duck since I have an affinity for the former & a rubber form of the latter who oversees my drinking & will be in an NBS pic later.  Nowt to report from the stark grey & white CAN. 8=( My last of the day for NBS (Week 659) began with a Crack! followed by a gentle Glug, revealing yet another deeply cloudy, unfiltered beer. Hmm. A vigorous in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of soapy, foamy, tawny head with limited retention, quickly reducing to wisps. Color was a milky, murky, cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM =4 - 5). Nose smelled of both tangerine/ sweet orange and honey, but it also had a bready yeastiness, like rising dough, that might have been avoided with some filtration. Mouthfeel was medium, but light for the style. The taste was kind of an oddball admixture of flavors, ranging from earthy, freshly-turned soil to sweet clover honey to rising bread dough to tangerine/sweet orange to a light alcohol heat that tingled my sinus cavity. Phew! It was certainly attention-getting, but it also had a graininess that left my mouth feel like it was coated in powder after each swallow. I CANnot help but wonder what even a modicum of filtration might have done for this beer. Finish was dry, but not overly bitter, more citrusy than anything else. I was glad to have tried it, but I was not as big a fan as others seem to have been, based on the overall score."
5235,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.33,"Average pour fills two-thirds of a pint glass with deep tan foam, takes some time to settle down enough to take a sip, curiously not much stick to the lacing. The liquid basically looks like you took a glass of apricot juice and stuck in the freezer, impenetrable and immobile. The nose packs a solid punch of dank herbaceousness, roofing tar, pine sap and thick, sticky pineapple, mango, kiwi with some melon and peach in reserve, not teasing out any citrus nor florality. Full-bodied, without the help of the weakish carbonation manages nonetheless to develop nice momentum across the palate. In turn while it's juicy and ""damp"" at first there is a pleasing elevation in dryness at the end. Notes of brioche and challah bread pile on the mango, papaya, pineapple, kiwi fruit, intense fruit flavors. Vanilla ice cream touch pops up now and then. Still barely registering any citrus, pink grapefruit if anything. On the whole it tastes awfully like a confection dessert. Scores points for sheer bombast but I'd be hard pressed to see anyone easily put back two cans of it in a row, it's that tiring. (Canned 7/30/21)"
5236,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.46,"while the side project wild beers have certainly been tending more acidic over the least year or so, in some instances, i think the higher acidity really works, and this is a great example of that. another one of the fruited fermier beers, up there with my favorites in the series, the plum, the cherry, and the blueberry, and i think the clean sourness that ramps up towards the end is part of what makes it. there is a lot of fruit in here, and a serious jammy sweetness is contributed by the raspberries, so the sour almost works to enhance and balance it, and with all the oak this has on it, along with the lemony funk, the drying cereal grain base, and the obvious maturity, its a complex and balanced brew that delivers what it seems to promise. i am not sure if this was aged in wine barrels or not, but it sure seems like it was, some notes of red and black currant in here, a tart cherry thing, and even a light strawberry thing, they all make it seem vinous to me, so does all the tannins in here. i even get trace watermelon flesh, juicy fruit gum, and red wine vinegar. suffice it to say there is quite a bit of depth to this. the fruit is insanely natural, really forward, and expressed beautifully through this base saison. almost as intense as i remember them being in the raspe, although i know this has to be less per barrel right? i also like it being a little stronger here, seems to slow me down, allow it to warm and open, and cut some of the flavor intensity with a little palate clearing alcohol. brilliant stuff, good carbonation too, especially compared to a few of the others in the series. the beat goes on for side project!"
5237,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.32,"Tasted from bottle. 2016 version. Pours dark brown with minimal tan head.

5240,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.46,"Pours Brown. Foamy, short tan had that lasts a little. Color is surprisingly light. Smells bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts, caramel and chocolate. Taste roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit hints, and caramel. Lots of barrel character it should be called bourbon rain instead. Finishes dry with a roasted and bourbon linger. Lighter medium body and lightly fizzy medium carbonation. Flavor is not as sweet as I was expecting but tastes amazing. The body was surprisingly thin though."
5241,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.76,"12 oz can (canned on 6/10/19, Drink by 7/22/19, opened and reviewed on 6/14/19) poured into a spiegelau glass. A golden color with light orange hues and a hazy, frosted opaqueness. Creamy white foam settles in eventually, with good cover and small islands of clumpy foam. Intricate lacing all over the place! The Nelson Sauvin hops from Australia bring forth aroma's of: white grape juice, tangerine, pineapple, dry summer grasses and Grandma's spice rack. The malt smells creamy, with golden wheat and assorted grains. Overall a very deep nose. O.k...wow. the mouthfeel is out-a-sight! Sooo lush, so smooth and full feeling. Somehow achieving a light, golden and crisp body with super smooth edges. There is an incredible, dry and snappy bite in the finish that just has me stunned. Luxurious. The complexity in the hop flavor is deep... practically bottomless. The unique, earthy, dried fruit and herbal nueances of this hop is on display in every imaginable way. Just when you think you've tasted every aspect, another one rolls in. Earthy...whole cone, wet and dry hopped style flavors roll in, and keep rolling. I love 2xIPA's that focus on one hop strain, so you get to know it's total vibe. Dry pineapple, white grapes, black pepper, herbs and spice mix and snappy citrus notes all sort of mingle and jangle around and on the palate. Team work!! Double Nelson and the Hill Farmstead folks are setting the bar, very, very high."
5242,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.2,"Pours an effervescent jet black with on finger of caramel colored head. So-so head retention & lacing, plenty of viscosity  S: Chocolate, rapsberries, figs. fades a touch once warm. Boozeyness then surfaces  T: Raspberry & dark chcoclate, raisins, roastyness & barrel dryness up front. More dark chococlate, barrel dryness & raspberry as this warms,a little raisin as well. Finishes with rapberry sweetness & tartness, a touch of breacing booze & barrel dryness, plus plenty of dark chococolate  MF: Fairly chewy, moderate carbonation  Pretty darn drinkable for the style & ABV, but enough heft to command respect"
5243,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.59,"2017 bottle (?), drank April, 2021 out of a tulip. 15.9% ABV Poured thick with little head. Nice bourbon smell, followed by sweet taste although I couldn’t get much coconut or vanilla. Think the coconut manifested itself in the sweetness. Very bourbony which was great. Thick mouthfeel.  Overall great beer, but these days it doesn’t stand out as much as it once may have given the huge plethora of coconut vanilla bourbon imperial stouts that are good to great..."
5244,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.55,"2017 vintage. Not a gusher. A: Pours very dark brown with a finger of khaki colored head. Very good retention with a solid ring and some swirls of foam.  S: Cinnamon and coffee feature, alongside dark dry chocolate, noticeable red chili, maple, and light roastiness. T: Cinnamon, hot cocoa, and roastiness in the forefront, with a backbone of medium roast coffee and light vanilla bean, finishing pretty dry with just a hint of red chili heat and a punch of cinnamon. Not picking up any maple. M: Full bodied with light carbonation. Fairly creamy. Mild alcohol warmth and a hint of a bite. O: Pretty tasty adjunct imperial stout. Dry enough, with sufficiently balanced flavors, that this is quite drinkable. The chili and maple come through much more when it hits cellar temp."
5245,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.4,"This APA is IPA’ish. Upfront & mid mouth it’s citrusy. Hoppy on the backend; the hoppy taste lingers for several minutes. Overall, those who love IPA’s; would love this beer. It’s very well done; good job 3 floyds!"
5246,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.33,"Really glad I was able to take an extended lunch break to try this much talked about beer. Appearance-wise, it takes on the typical Trillium look - opaque with solid head retention. Wow what an aroma - smacked me in the face - grapefruit, resiny pine, heaven. However, the taste is a little overkill. I can tell it was brewed with 6 different hops - flavors are all over the place but ultimately it feels like I'm chewing on grapefruit skin. This is very good, but a little overhyped. People go nuts for this beer every year, I would try again but not go out of my way for it."
5247,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.38,"Thank you Jon for hooking me up with this one! Pint can dated 10/04/18 pink dot. Poured into a tulip at 44f Pours a pretty hazy, rich honey golden, with a fluffy, two-finger ever-so-slightly off-white head, slowly slinking down to small patchy islands of film, and a little collar. Some spotty lacing. Absolutely beautiful color. Nose is dank dank dank Mosaic hops. That dark fruit/berry aroma, with a big impression of passionfruit and over-ripe mango. Some Meyer lemon action in there as well. Sweet, dank, and tropical fruity. Very Mosaic. Palate is very dank. There is a fragile malt backbone, providing just a touch of sweetness, but the hops are the star of the show here. The malt here is just enough of a platform to securely showcase the huge Mosaic dry hopping headline. Big dankness. That passionfruit is much more muted on the palate, with more of a berry/starfruit/mango vibe. It is still fruity, but the scale is tipped way in favor the dank side. A very restrained bitterness comes in towards the finish, taking this fruity dankness, and drying it out to chalky proportions. Balanced. Uber hoppy. This drinks way more like an IPA than an APA. Mouthfeel is crisp, but medium bodied. It has some good heft to it. A lot of body for the ABV. It's soft and super juicy up front, and then the dryness comes in on the finish, drying it out very fast. Carbonation is medium and strong, and gives it a little bit of lift. Overall, this is a fantastic pale ale. It has so much flavor. I don't think you could make this anymore flavorful. The Mosaic dry-hopping is great. The quintessential essence of Mosaic. The nose is to die for, and the feel is great. Absolute Mosaic flavor bomb. My first offering from Trillium, and I'm impressed. Scored a touch low, because I still have some killer beers to review (Galaxy Cutting Tiles) and I didn't want to over-rate myself into a corner. This is fantastic. If you love Mosaic like I do, you need this."
5248,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.52,"Canned 7/11/20 (I think, the stamping was very compressed and distorted) Once again shifting away from their hoppy portfolio, we have a highly regarded milk stout that was included in the mixed case I got Pours completely pitch black with a massive 3 fingers of espresso colored head that fades slowly to a cap and leaves patchy lacing In the nose, I pick up rich milk chocolate, roasty coffee, vanilla, and subtle hints of dark fruit, toffee, and cinnamon. A very enticing aroma here Up front in the taste I get a nice balance of char and sweet chocolate. On the swallow, it become evident why this is a milk stout. Layered with juicy raisin, rich chocolate, and light coffee roast, this is sweet but absolutely fucking brilliant This has a medium full body with light tingly carbonation, leading to a finish that is a touch sticky and sweet. The relatively low alcohol content almost feels like a joke, as this drinks like a beer that is over 10% Well, it’s certainly true when they say this drinks bigger than it actually is. I’m floored by the way they coax huge flavors out of something with such a low abv. Bravo guys, this exceeds some of their IPAs"
5249,King Julius,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.83,"A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a decent cap that leaves good lacing S: A mix of citrus, dank weed, and tropical fruit up front. Some lighter floral and pine notes in there as well. A juicy hop bomb T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of citrus and tropical fruit. Orange, mango, and grapefruit stick out. Some of the dank weed/herbal notes also come through, but not nearly as strong as the nose led on. Lighter floral notes present as well. Light bitterness. Finishes with lingering citrus and tropical fruit M: Medium bodied with low-moderate carbonation. Super fluffy and smooth O: The king is for real. Amplifies on all the great aspects of Julius while getting bigger and somehow better. A juice bomb that does everything right. Extremely highly recommended"
5250,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.65,"I just had a cellered Lou Pepe Kriek from Cantillon bottled in 2010. I poured it into a snifter. I imagined myself being in the garden of a Belgian Brassiere while drinking it. Look: dark reddish light brown with a thin white head Aroma: cherry pie and red wine. Taste: wheat/grain, tart and slightly sweet cherry, lots of cherry, some funk/vinegar, red wine and oak. Body/Overall: medium body, soft/velvety, well balanced and delicious."
5251,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.72,"Right up front I get the classic dark fruits. Plum, raisin and fig with a touch of dark cherry. The malt has a deep earthy and somewhat nutty quality with a very mild molasses like sweetness and bitterness playing off each other. I also get a light note of black licorice and some bitter bakers chocolate moving into the finish. The finish has a firm earthy almost leathery hop bitterness with a warming Sherry or Madeira like alcohol character."
5252,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.52,Cloudy straw color with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a prominent grapefruit aroma. Taste is also a prominent grapefruit taste with a little touch of hops. Nice blend
5253,Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.32,"2020 version poured into a tulip glass. I had the 2019 coffee version on tap earlier today, which is excellent. A dark black with a thin half inch dark tan head. Zero visibility through. The aroma is vanilla, cinnamon, and chocolate. The taste is very similar, with a touch of the pepper zing. The flavors are blended well. The mouthfeel is full, but not sticky, carbonation medium low. Good as it advertised."
5254,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.2,"750ml into a matching Hoarders snifter. The brew streams dark brown in color and comes to rest in my glass dark brown to almost black with a finger khaki topping that fades to a thin film. Smells sweet like candy with a solvent kick. Mild anise, toasted coconut mashmallow and chocolate. Tastes sweet and boozy with a mild spicy oakiness. There is a lasting flavor of raisons and mildly musty oak. Some solvent booze, chocolate and toasted mashmallow/coconut. This is full bodied and lightly carbonated. A pleasant sipper but hardly differentiated from normal bourbon BT."
5255,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.05,"Poured from a tap at the initial release of Duck Duck Gooze in 2009, lovingly collected in a 16oz clear Solo cup. So I was doing consulting work in SoCal in 2009. Gueuze wasn't my thing; I'd never had a sip in 40 years of fine beer drinking. My son informed me that the Lost Abbey was putting out this Duck Duck Goose beer that Saturday, that his friend would have donated his right arm to be there, and could I pick up a bottle for his friend. It was a bit of a hike from where I was to where the beer was, and I'd have to stay the weekend to boot. His friend is a good guy, so sure, I'll stay. I arrived early for the opening, or so I thought. A very long line snaked through the parking lot 90 minutes before release time, and I took my place. I remember the sun was beating down from a cloudless sky, and I was getting an unanticipated sunburn atop my head. Finally I heard a cheer from the front of the line that quickly snaked by me to the end of the line (I couldn't see it.) There was a 2 bottle limit on purchases, which initially bummed me out (this was the first time I waited in a beer line in 30+ years.) However, inside the warehouse a bar was set up and they were serving healthy pours of DDG. My initial impressions were negative, as in ""what is this?"" But as I made my way to the bottom of my Solo cup, it started to grow on me. I was able to get a second pour - same cup - and this one I took my time to savor. I've been drinking gueuze til today.  And the friend: he ended up getting both bottles with my compliments. He repaid me years later with a bottle of Kate the Great. Both of us are older, life's gotten in the way so neither of us follow beer as we used to, until for me anyway COVID has reintroduced me to BA. Hopefully beer follies will begin anew, and I'll be standing in a few more beer lines."
5256,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.26,"absolutely wonderful beer and one off of the long time wants list for me, who would have guessed it would take moving to idaho to find one?! in any event, its worth the hype and the years of frothing for one, a decadent barleywine experience with lots of barrel character, a ton of malt richness and layering, but not as over the top heavy and sweet as some of these can be, as it has a great maturity, lots of wood, some tannins from the oak, and enough barrel char and booze to keep it from being diabetic. pretty deep amber color with some head from the bottle, dense but not sedimented, and high shine in the right light. aroma is awesome, slight oxidation over sweet concentrated grain sugars, molasses and maple notes, some soy sauce, high end bourbon, vanilla, burnt wood, toffee, creme brulee, and a fruity mix of dried apple, raisin, and holiday fruitcake. the enormous alcohol content makes no effort to conceal itself either. the flavor has a ton going on too, sweet dates and molasses, a little more of the soy thing, lots of woody maturity and a ton of whiskey, vanilla and honey notes from it, some bitter char thats needed for balance here, and a whole ton of booze, but its warming me from the inside out in the most pleasant way. this is a monster, even if the body isnt as big as some of them, its a slow sipper and one to cherish and savor. i see why this has become sort of a cult following beer, its a prime example of the style and is wonderfully barrel aged. worth every penny!"
5257,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,3.9,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKG05/13/21 14:52:24 BEST BY 09/10/21"" Appearance: The body of the beer is a light colored milky beige that is completely opaque. The head is white and frothy with mostly large bubbles. It doesn't seem to create much lacing but it has decent retention and alright formation. Aroma: It floods the room with aroma as soon as the can is cracked and pouring it only sends out the aroma even more. The beer has a nice grapefruit aroma and a bit of a wildflower scent. The aroma isn't very strong in the beer but it's nice. There is a clear presence of aroma but getting close to the surface of the beer shows how muted it is. Taste: Up front there is a bit of passion fruit flavor along with some grapefruit. These flavors carry on to the middle of the palate where a peach character joins in the party. Mouthfeel: It has a medium-light body with a mellow bitterness. There doesn't appear to be an ABV listed on the can but it does state that this is a ""DOUBLE INDIA PALE ALE"" and whatever ABV it has it does a good job of hiding it which is noteworthy. It's also very easy to drink. Overall: It's a very enjoyable New England Style Double IPA. The beer has a very good delivery and the flavors change as they cross over the palate. The beer is very fruity and has a mild bitterness so it could pair well with brunch foods. It would be a good beer to drink for any occasion but it would probably shine during a holiday brunch or lunch with family and friends. I would definitely buy it again and I would highly recommend it."
5258,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.7,"L: dark dark brown, with some reddish brown at the edges. Like a very dark cola."
5259,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.19,"A 2015 vintage - consumed for the 2021 Online Barleywine Tasting  Pours a ruddy, rusty mahogany brown - sitting muddled in the glass, with very little light penetration. A frothy, almost boiling cap of loose caramel bubbles fizz around before quickly dying down. Nose: I can smell this from several feet away. This is absolutely massive dark fruits - uncanny aromas of prunes, madjool dates, dried Turkish figs, dried cranberries, fruit leather, apple cider, concord grape skins, black cherry juice, cranberry-apple juice cocktail...the fruit complexity is insane - dark, juicy, and unbelievably deep. There's leather, saddle, dusty oak, old library, Irish malt whiskey, California laurel leaves after a rain, wild peppermint, and some toasted sugar. Very intriguing. Palate: MoaS greets the palate with a balanced malty sweetness paired with an immediate, but subtle and restrained bright fruity acidity. Fermented apple, dates, dried figs, then tons of burned toffee, burned sugar, toasted pipe tobacco, black treacle, and even a bit of stouty roast. Big bourbon barrel presence, with splintery oak, char, and spirit. Definitely some oxidation here, with some sherry-like character, and it becomes clear that laurel note is also a product of that - lending this interesting sort of minty/camphoraceous element that my NorCal hiking enthusiast BAs are definitely familiar with. There's another odd oxidized note that is very difficult to describe, but it isn't exactly delicious, and I find it's highlighting a bitterness in here - a burned quality. The finish sees that bitterness grow, with the bright fruity notes falling back, revealing some earthiness, along with more barrel, tobacco, and oxidation. Mouthfeel/Body: This one is certainly full-bodied. It isn't syrupy and viscous like today's hype stouts, but it's a chewy, heavy, slick ale - with a lower degree of effervescence that's there - but diesnt fully push through the weight of the ale. It dries out, becoming more fluid, and tightens its grip with a splintery dry finish. Some stickiness definitely left around the lips. Overall: There's a lot going on here. The aroma id simply divine, and unlike any barleywine I've encountered. It's complex and beautiful. Unless this is a naturally bitter barleywine, I think the oxidation has hurt this one a bit. While it adds complexity, there's just this unusual tannic burned thing going on, and it detracts from the overall character. I can see a beautiful barleywine in here, and everything surrounding that character is enjoyable, but perhaps this is one to enjoy fresher? I'll definitely have to try to sample a newer bottle. Finishing all this may be a challenge."
5260,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.55,"I tried 2017 and 2020 versions of this beer. Both pretty amazing beers, this rating is for the 2020 version which I thought was a bit more crisp and diverse in it's taste."
5261,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.54,"Maple nose, maple and roasty coffee combo throughout, and a long, lingering finish with a bit of heat. The maple does not overpower and fits in nicely with the coffee and roasty stout base. Like others have mentioned, the price tag is a bit prohibitive. However, the beer itself is excellent."
5262,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.12,"Can from Vinyl Beer on the UES NYC. Pours an almost clear light amber with two fingers of fluffy white head that sticks around, great lacing, smell is muted musty pine, orange and grapefruit zest, peach rings, caramel malts, taste is big chewy dark crust bready malts up front, transitions to bitter pine and grapefruit pith, feel is full bodied with nice carbonation. An epic big boy bitter pale ale."
5263,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.66,"Poured from a 32 oz growler into a snifter. Mild carbonation, dark brown with slight ruby edging. Big berry notes on the smell with mild barrel presence. Berry on the forefront of the taste, barrel is very mild. Smooth syrupy feel, alcohol is disguised well. Exceptional beer."
5264,Double Stack,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.91,"On draft at Georgetown taproom some time ago. This beer really left an impression. It was cold and raining when it was served to me. After about 15 seconds of it being on the table outside, I could smell it clear as day, even through my mask. Tons of maple and coffee: absolutely divine. The taste was just as good. Roasted coffee and a bucketload of maple yet so well balanced. The foam laced the sides of the glass as I drank it. Damn near perfect."
5265,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.69,"Had on tap. Finally got to try this lambic, was skeptical of the praise, but wow this was amazing! The apricot just explodes onto the palate on the finish with supporting flowers, hay, candi sugar, peach jam, pear, and funky yeast. So much fullness of flavor while maintaining a light, delicate and exception mouthfeel. Smell is not as vibrant, yet does put the spotlight on the apricot and peach yogurt (yeast) aromas. Pours bright gold with plenty of white foam, amazing lambic! Despite my doubts, the hype is real!"
5266,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.35,"Massive thanks, again, to rawfish for pointing me to a bottle shop with this untried gem. 22 oz. grey-waxed bottle split with my wife while sitting in my boxers in a warm San Diego kitchen.  Dark, dank, musty, old dictionary brown gives way to vanilla, coconut, faint barrel, with a baster of allspice on the finish. Not bad, but not aggressive either.  Coconut B-Bomb - b-bomb, a-bomb, h-bomb, all accurate. The coconut gets a Cold War escalation from mild to spine-tingling within a few degrees. Beneath being struck in the larynx with the coconut is gentle bourbon, appropriate cinnamon (not easy to do), vanilla as Ben Affleck, brown sugar, with a long, leather-smooth finish sliding into a bowl of turkey-prepped spicing. Did I mention smooth? Bloody easy to drink.  The coconut gives a monopropellant thrust to an already lovely base beer. Sub-elite which is to say, excellent."
5267,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.26,"2016 release - consumed on November 12, 2020. "
5268,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.0,"Holy crap is this rated high, I had no idea. Well its time then. Pours a cloudy yellow with 1/2"" white head. This review is from a sample on tap at the Bistro barrel aged festival. Dry yeast brett nose to it. Light. When you talk rustic agricultural stuff, here it is, plenty of leather meets wood meets hay meets various barnyard effects here. This is what its all about. Layers of aromas.  The taste is pretty nice, you get about a 6 on the 1-10 sour scale, soft acidity, still plenty of those hay, leather, cotton, humidity and barnyard notes. Its like a blend of a saison, but the sourness of a wild ale. Light amount of pepper in the mouth feel, along with all that other stuff. Carbonation is more than average.  I really enjoyed the beer, but wow, I think if you put an InBev label on this, it wouldn't even move the needle for beer nerds. Instead, low yield small batches from a slightly out of the way brewery = ratings gold (on BA). I totally dug it, but it didn't even stand out that day amongst all the other beers."
5269,Scaled Way Up,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.18,"Canned about a week ago. A: Pours a light hazy orange with a finger of bright white, dense head. Very good retention and lacing. S: Dried potpourri, orange julius and orange pith, hay, and very light grainy malt.  T: Dried flowers, a bit of pine, medium well-integrated bitterness, and again some wheat graininess. Fairly dry, a bit too dry for the style. M: Medium body and medium-high, somewhat sharp carbonation. Slight creaminess.  O: Pretty tasty, dried-flower-forward IPA. A little sweetness might bring the flavors together."
5270,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,3.96,"Canned 3/27/19. Pours a mild golden hue with a thin head into my glass. Strong hop punch in the nose with pineapple and grapefruit. Extremely bitter with grapefruit, pineapple and lychee making their presence known in the mouth. Acidic finish that reminds one to sip, not quaff. At 10.3%, it's stronger than most IPAs and if you like your IPAs on the lower side of the spectrum, you may not enjoy this. I do though. Well worth it."
5271,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.53,"2011 bottle poured into a snifter. A hazy medium brown color with a thin tan head. Aroma was whiskey barrel up front followed by sweet caramel, toffee, and faint stone fruit. The taste followed thankfully. A rich, smooth experience of caramel and toffee malt balanced by plum and prune notes, framed by a restrained barrel presence. Full bodied and just rounded. A bit oxidized but this did not detract. Phenomenal."
5272,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.32,"Bout Six/February 2019 bottle.  Pouring from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a wine glass, this beer pours out a light pink color and forms in the glass a color resembling a rose. It has sea foam pink bubbles that are noisily popping the whole way through the pour.  The nose brings a very real cherry element; tamed and subtle. It has a slight acidity. I like the realness aspect but it does seem to be underwhelming overall in the nose.  The taste comes in with a prominence of cherries; all kinds, from sweet to tart. It offers a really balanced tartness that by no means try’s to steal from the show. A nice carbonation that leaves you burping up the flavors of cherries. I don’t pick up much of any barrel aging; maybe a very slight, dry oak but that’s it. I like how you can really see the cherries battling in this as it bounces from tart to sweet cherries; all the while keeping it natural.  Overall, it does end up being a bit one dimensional and doesn’t showcase much of any barrel, but the dimension it shoots for (cherries) gets nailed. It’s a nice, well made, refreshing brew."
5273,Double Citra®,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.49,"Appearance: poured a non-translucent cloudy peach color beer. Finished with a 1 inch head that disappeared quickly.  Smell: a ton of passion fruit, some orange juice, and vanilla at the nose. Kind of like a creamsicle. Very sweet.  Taste: heavy orange juice with hint of tropical fruits. Large amounts of vanilla, again giving this a creamy flavor and feel. Nice dank bitterness midway through without any hop burn.  Mouthfeel: very smooth, creamy. Medium bodied.  Overall: a well rounded juicy double NEIPA. Love the bursting oranges and passion fruit."
5274,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.4,"Poured from 16oz tall can into a tulip. Canned on 6/17/20. My first Tree House beer! Appearance: highly turbid darkish-yellow hue with two thick fingers of frothy ivory foam atop. Looks great. Smell: dank yet fresh; there's a good underlying juiciness and sweetness. It doesn't knock me over with volume, but it is largely free of flaws. Very good indeed. Taste: dank and juicy, but not as dank as the aroma; the flavor is much more ""approachable"", as it were. Bitterness is quite low but still present, and the fresh juiciness builds on the palate in a delicious way. This is indeed among the best hazies I have had. Mouthfeel: medium body but with a good carbonation and an absolutely huge creaminess. Very satisfying. Overall: Tree House has a lot of hype around them, but in this case, I tend to think it justified. Just a wonderful beer."
5275,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.49,"Wow-this is the best Mosaic hopped beer I have ever had. Super bright pineapple, citrus rind and a touch of dank. Crazy crushable and smooth. Really impressive take on the style. Glad I can get this in my area. Highly recommended."
5276,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.94,"Awesome beer. Wine barrel present, expands on what I love about Arthur. Soft, citrus presence. Makes me want more and more of this. Would bang again!"
5277,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.68,Pours a straight black with light tan lacing. Low carb but enough to avoid a flat finish. Vanilla is present on the nose and overall vanilla held up very well despite being 4 years old now. Mouth feel is velvety smooth. Barrel is almost gone and oddly could've used a smidge more heat to balance the slight sweetness but this was excellent overall. Super easy drinking
5278,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.23,"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 9/24/2019. Pours fairly hazy deep golden amber/light orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp finishing. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-plus carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mild increasing warmth of 9.5% After the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; dangerously smooth and easy to drink for the big ABV, with the moderately bitter/resinous/drying finish; not overly aggressive. Amazing Simcoe, Citra, Galaxy and Mosaic profile. Extremely vibrant, juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a nice sized honey and bready malt backbone. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp resin dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. Loved the hop profile as expected."

5280,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.27,"Drank on 9/19/2019. Traveling hotel beer - this was an excellent treat after a 12 hour day at work. Sweet, light, and fragrant. Beautiful orange, opaque pour, very hazy. Quite good."
5281,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.52,"This one struck me as a little bitter at first, but I ended up really enjoying it as I went on. The combination of hops in this one works very well, making it another solid DIPA from HF."
5282,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,5.0,Bottle of Parabajava 2015 opened on 1/9/2019; A unicorn was found and did not disappoint! Great MF and very well balanced. Some things just get better with age....
5283,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.42,"Description: Appearance is jet black, like the normal Speedway, with little to no head. Smell is full of oak but not so much bourbon. Coffee, dark chocolate and roasty notes are also apparent. The woodiness of the oak really comes through on the taste and adds a lot of earthiness to the beer. Taste is not as coffee heavy as the smell. Feel is more like a porter in that it's a little light for a stout. Minimal carbonation and smooth drinking. Suggested food pairing: BBQ ribs If you like this beer then you should also try: KBS Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely have it again) This is certainly a great derivative of an already stellar brew. Feel is a little thin and it could use more bourbon flavor but this is an all around fantastic beer!"
5284,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.51,"If you wanted a drinkable DIPA, you will find it hard to beat this. The first time round I didn't think this was a DIPA - it's smooth and you notice the Citra only if you know it. Before long it disappears as you keep drinking it only to make a roaring comeback just when you want to dismiss it. Probably not the one DIPA for me but it will be hard to not have it in the stable. Certainly a memorable version of a DIPA."
5285,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.93,"Jet black pour with a 3/4"" tan head on the top of it, looks gorgeous like a model. So much chocolate smells on this one, vanilla, bourbon.  Taste is so thick, chocolate, bourbon, oak. I'm talking that super deep double German chocolate cake. "
5286,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.6,"The pour is black with mahogany colors on the edges, underneath a dense tan head. The first note on the nose is rich coffee - wow. This literally reminds me of brunch. There’s also a significant cinnamon component. I am now officially salivating. The maple and cinnamon are more prominent on the taste, which really elevates this, IMHO, because they are the perfect balance to the roasty coffee flavors, and admit milk chocolate flavors to the imperial porter dance party Kane has served up. The mouthfeel is a bit chewy, which fits this beer perfectly. This flavor profile (chocolate, coffee, maple) is popular, and Kane absolutely nailed this with the cinnamon addition."
5287,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.51,"Tasted from bottle. Pours dark brown with thin beige head. Aroma of cognac, molasses, caramel. Thick, cloying, chewy mouthfeel. Moderate to heavily sweet. Flavors of brown sugar, molasses, cognac, toffee, caramel, and hints of oak. Just a perfect barleywine."
5288,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.59,"Bottled 1'21, consumed 4'21. Poured into a tulip glass (cuz i like those). Intentionally foamed it a bit & beer responded w/ small/mid-sized head."

Really delightful brew, and let this baby breathe! You will be rewarded as the beer temperature gets into the 50s. Classic Trillium!"
5292,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.74,"Getting lots of mango, papaya, pineapple, some pine. All on top of a nice pilsner presence, with some fresh baked bread and wheat.

5293,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.54,"Poured from a bomber into a taster. Thanks Ryan for sharing.  Pours a magnificent neon pink body with a bright pink head. Brightest, most unique looking beer I've ever witnessed. Wow.  Taste and aromas align.. Straight passion fruit, candy-like fruity tartness.. Hawaiian warheads if that existed . grassy, earthy, lactic and citrus tartness, pulpy. Drinks like fruit juice."
5294,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.01,"650ml bottle, 2018 vintage, poured into an oversized Funky Buddha snifter glass. Enjoyed on 11.24.18, reviewed from Tasting Journey.  The beer pours a jet black color, thick and with a nice viscosity, opaque with a loose khaki head that rises nicely with moderate retention and lacing. The aroma is pleasant, sweet and rich maple leaps out with chocolate and roasty coffee, dark grains, cream and a nice salinity emerges that evokes bacon. The flavors are good, really coffee forward with a nice roast, moderate acidity but a good richness that plays nicely with toasted dark malts while the maple comes out behind the roasted quality toning down the beer and bringing out some cream flavors while a lingering saltiness washes the palate. The mouthfeel is okay, a thinner medium body that coats well, lively and bubbly texture with a nice soft finish. Verdict: A good adjunct porter from Funky Buddha. The texture is a bit thin relative to the amount of flavor packed into this beer while causes there to be a bit of balance issue. In terms of the actual flavors involved, the maple and bacon are great nuances to what is a very coffee forward beer."
5295,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.82,"Picked this up at trillium in boston 10 days ago and drank one of them that night. It was very good but a bit bitter. Had another one tonight and it was bursting with juiciness and flavor. My mouth is watering. Might be worth leaving in the fridge for a week or two. This is one of the best trillium beers, thus the best beers ive ever had. Definitely the best double ipa ive ever had"
5296,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.99,"2016 variant (bottle number unknown) drank in a snifter on 12/16/2016 L-thick, black, motor oil, nice lacing, minimal head...one of the thickest beers I have had S/T-wow this is amazing. the barrel alone without adjuncts is unbelieveable. The bourbon, VANILLA-y oak, and barrel come through exceptionally well F-thick, oily, amazing Overall-I am amazing at how different these BA DLs are compared to the base. The barreling is outstanding at Floyd's and maybe even underrated (if possible) based on how the gen pop seems to feel about the base DL (which I still enjoy). This is for sure underrated as it definitely held its own with BVDL and FVM. AMAZING!!!"
5297,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.35,"Poured from cellar temp on 3/7/2021 bottle dare 8/25/2015  Pours a reddish amber with a cream colored head that leaves a ring of lacing.  Nose of red wine, subtle candied cherry, caramel, mild grain, mild oxidation.  Taste follows with a well blended red wine and candied cherries, oak follows with minimal grain, some oxidation but adds to the complexity of the beer.  Feel is light with light carb and lingers on the pallet for medium length.  Overall, this beer has held up incredibly well. Balance between candied cherry, and the pinot barrels is excellent. There is some oxidation, but do not think it is making this beer worse, but adds to the complexity."
5298,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.46,Man is that thick. So malty! Tastes like an English style IPA. Some throat and chest burn - it's hot. Crisp. Not very bitter. Dank fruit. Tremendously dangerous for a triple - too smooth.
5299,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.9,"One of those long time wants that lived up to all the hype and anticipation. Bottled 7/28. An extremely cloudy pale orange gold color with mild head and lacing. Smell is strong citrus notes of orange and pineapple, a mild dank pine underneath. Taste is where it shines. It’s big and juicy and citrusy, but it’s got a very strong bitterness that competes equally, so it achieves some serious balance. Medium bodied, almost an equal dry/mouth watering finish, subtle alcohol presence. It’s a welcome departure to the usual NEIPA, and it is an extremely great beer. I’ll gladly buy it again given the chance."
5300,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.79,"Old school big IPA. Doesn’t fall into the trappings of being a syrupy mess because of the high abv. Dry, bitter, resinous, scary easy to drink. Well crafted. I had very few TIPAs that I like, love this one."
5301,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.58,This is like a sweeter version of Backyard Rye. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night at a recent tasting. Certainly worth trying or seeking out if you are into fruited chocolate truffle flavors in your stouts.
5302,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.93,"Hazy orange body with tons of funk on the nose. Some tartness, but not too much. Delicious funky flavor that you only get biting into an apricot, just perfect."
5303,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.84,"The listing says this is retired but Cycle had it on tap at Barrel Aged Day March 13, 2020. It was available at both tap stations and it didn't last long. I got one from each station and it seemed slightly different. Look- A dark black with a coating of beige head that clings to the edges of the glass. Smell- One station definitely had more strawberry aroma. Both had vanilla and bourbon mixed to perfection.  Taste- A great mix of all strawberry vanilla, bourbon, and cocoa. As it warmed the chocolate was more fudge like and barrel cut the sweetness. The first station did have less of the strawberry vanilla mix but the second one was great. Mouthfeel- A creamy mix that lingers perfectly. It coats your tongue and leaves you wanting more. Overall- Probably the best brew I have had from Cycle. A complex mix that works to perfection. Worth every penny to get attend the event."
5304,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.26,"From a can dated 4/26/18, poured into a glass at home.  Looks like muddy apricot, virtually opaque. Modest head, some lacing.  The smell was the high point for me -- so much hops, I felt like I was standing in a brewery.  Initial taste entry was quite acidic and carbonated. Taste levels out to include citrus (grapefruit, pineapple) with a long, bitter -- but not unpleasant -- finish."
5305,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.36,"Pours golden amber with a thick white head that turns into plentiful lacing. Aroma is hop floral forward, some citrus. Flavor is a ride of hop bitterness and malt/honey sweetness. The hop floral notes evolve after each sip bringing a range of flavors. Feel is good for all the bitterness. Full and coating. Overall an interesting DIPA, be ready for the flavor experience."
5306,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.38,"Pours a murky orange that glows like a Dragonball when held up to the light. Snow-white foam tops out at just over a finger after a modest pour, and retains well. Aroma is orange, tangerine, papaya, and pineapple form a smashing, but not brutal or harsh, tropical fruit display. It smells a little sweet. Toasty biscuit, wheat, and bread malt notes help bring down the sugary citrus rush. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, orange, and mango with a hit of toasty biscuit, and bready malt notes. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fuzzy, nearing-on-velvety texture at the onset and then thins out on the tongue. It has a middle of the road consistency. Overall, a flavorful American Pale Ale, although it really drinks like any other NE IPA just with a little more malt at the forefront. Knocked down 1/4 of a point for that. The malt balance here helps counteract the sugary hop pull most NE IPAs carry, landing this one at a very favorable balance. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can."
5307,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.4,"2017 release (El Cat Round 7). A: Pours a viscous black with a smattering of dark brown head. Leaves a razor-thin ring which lasts for a decent bit. S: Cinnamon in the forefront, loads of dark cocoa, charred oak, light bourbon and vanilla, and a bit of pepper/alcohol burn in the nose as well. T: Cinnamon, dark chocolate, vanilla, along side an accent of red pepper, light oak and bourbon, and a bit of red fruit (cherry, almost). Fairly dry with mild roastiness and dark roast coffee through the finish. Almost moderate heat from the chili—it kind of sneaks up on you. M: Mouth-coating full body with a moderate alcohol burn. If the beer weren’t so big and flavorful, the alcohol presence would probably be more distracting than it is. Medium carbonation ties things together. O: Tasty stuff, and fairly drinkable despite the heat, which doesn’t detract much. Lots of flavors here, but it doesn’t seem as integrated or elegant as it could be, and the barrel presence isn’t huge."
5308,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.49,Loads of orange and stone fruit - super dank and not too sweet which I appreciate . Little earthy and a lot of juice- very nice! Mouthfeel is perfect!
5309,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.41,"16oz can from Tavour. Hazy yellow body with a small, frothy white head. Aroma is a blend of floral and yeasty notes, soft, welcoming. Citrus and tropical fruity scent. Taste brings the juicy tropical fruit up front, yeast and floral flavors backing it up, and finishes with a whimper of bitterness. Soft, full, creamy, silky. Exquisite."
5310,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.66,"Had a freshy can thanks to my friend who graciously gifted me one since I threw a bunch of brews his way for a party. When you open the can, it doesn't just greet you with an aroma, it jumps out and punches you in the face. The flavor is wave upon wave of juicy and dank hoppy goodness. It's hard to describe all the flavors since it's like describing the sound of a volcanic explosion: really fucking loud. I get a ton of tropical fruit with berries and dank resin. Mosaic plays the lead role with Galaxy as an obvious supporting job. Serious body commands this to be sipped and enjoyed, but I never got any booze heat or warmth. Overall this is my favorite Trillium to date with Galaxy Cutting Tiles coming in a close second. 7/17/18 can consumed on 7/26/18 in a tulip glass."
5311,Dinner,100,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.23,"on draft, served in a Maine Beer Co glass slightly hazy dark yellow golden in color, thick white head. good head retention. nice mix of tropical and grassy hop aroma. taste is similar, sort of a nice mix of WC and NE style. fairly bitter. medium bodied. good, but not world-class."
5312,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,100,Pale Ale - American,6.8%,4.09,Look - thick thick hazy slightly tan yellow with a great white head and lacing
5313,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.6,"Poured into a HF bulb. Brownish/Black in color with a small mocha head. Smells of dark fruit, some maple, oak and bourbon. Taste is exactly as the nose but more prominent. Not as much maple as one might think but it’s there. Just a treat to sip on. Feel is slick and mouth coating, almost chewy. Overall, this is really great. HF just makes everything well and this is no exception."
5314,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.85,"Vintage 2006. Opened in 2016 as a toast to friendship and craft beer.  L: Red wine lipstick crimson on the body with heated Jell-O colored foam on the pour.  S: Predominantly red wine and oak, with bits of earthy funk and muted fruit lingering on the nose. As the beer warms, the aromas open up, highlighting a wonderful blend of vinous cherry notes that take over the olfactory senses.  T: Very tart up front, showcasing Cantillon's signature lambic, then mellowing after the first wave as the sour cherries begin to pop; acidic fruit flavor then takes over, resonating throughout the palate, leaving hints of oak and mild tannins that finish with a taste of sweet cherries.  F: The mouthfeel is light and clean with a dry finish. Well carbonated.  O: This is one of the finest beers I have ever had. It showcases the best of what a fruited Belgian lambic can offer to the senses. For me, it is the near perfect balance of sour, funk, fruit, and meticulous barrel aging, all coming to together to create a masterful beer."
5315,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.48,"A - Pours pitch black with a thin tan head. Good amount of soapy lacing. S - Aroma is coconut, dark chocolate and coffee. T - The taste is coconut, dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, roasted malts and bourbon. M - Full body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish. O - This is a killer BBA porter. Great balance with the alcohol going completely undetected."
5316,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.46,"Canned 4 days ago and poured into a pint glass (only ""beer"" glass available at time of pour). Pours a glowing, hazy orange / yellow. Modest head that leaves behind some nice, thin lacing. Aroma comes off the beer in waves of tropical, hoppy goodness. Taste is a nice combination of citrus & tropical notes, but with just the right balance of hops and a tiny bit of bite. Medium carbonation and a medium to medium full mouth feel. Overall, while I'm not a huge IPA fan in general, I have to admit this is a great beer."
5317,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.53,Into a wine glass at a share. Amazingly clean. Soft nectarine and huge waves of apricot; everything from the pit to the flesh. Perfectly balanced tartness to compliment it.
5318,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.34,"Picked up a single from Kings Beer & Wine 12-18-19 for $4.19. Canned on 10-31-19; consumed on 2-17-20. Beer poured a golden orange with a nice white head with the original pour. Nose is old school double IPA, not the hop burst you get today but a beautiful combo of the sweet malts infused with grapefruit, orange, and mango. Taste is awesome! Huge malt base meets a Citra dominated hop addition with orange, mango, and grapefruit balancing nicely. Finishes with a solid bitterness; 8/10 on my scale. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied and very smooth. Overall a wonderful old school DIPA that is big and flavorful but not the old school booziness. Well made! I will definitely seek out a four pack next fall!"
5319,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.55,"Review #8000, 2015 vintage. This will be a very emotional review. Normally for big milestones like this, rudzud would have some crazy beer to share, but that can't happen now. Instead this was one from our share box that we got from Hoarders, saving for a special day. He might not be here physically to share it with me, but he's here in spirit. Pours basically with no head, whisp of fizzy bubbles disappears almost instantly, dark murky molasses brown color with no real light coming through, and legs for days Nose brings lots of barrel and bourbon, lots of vanilla oak, a bit buttery oak, fresh bourbon barrel juice, a bit like my nose in a Glencairn glass with some decent bourbon, lots of dark malts under that, some roast and coffee, no char, loads of cocoa, dark chocolate, a little nougat candy bar, fudge, a bit of a chocolate syrup as well, a little alcohol Taste super rich heavy malts and barrel, dark chocolate, raw cocoa, chocolate syrupy again, a bit of a candy bar with light nougat and caramel notes, some roast and coffee as well, more like a coffee syrup, barrel brings lots of vanilla again and fresh bourbon barrel juice, a little generic whiskey character but some raw sweet bourbon as well, getting fudgey in the middle, some toasted oak character and layers of vanilla, a touch of baking spice, med lighter bitterness mostly from the roasted malts, some hot alcohol not quite fusel but almost there, finishes sticky and coats the mouth, never really goes away, lingering cocoa, fudge, vanilla and generic whiskey Mouth is full bod, rich syrupy and really coats the mouth, some hot tingly alcohol, med-light foamy carb Overall quite nice, there have been better Bruery beers, but for a Black Tuesday variant adding the extra bourbon and barrel was nice, although I think it has dropped a bit from what it probably was fresh, but alcohol didn't destroy either as the age probably helped there.  I swear I heard a pop sound from my glass while it was resting and I was typing. Matt must have taken his sip, and I hope he enjoyed it. Miss the great bottle shares and fun times. This was just one more milestone in my reviews. I know rudzud always joked about how he would never catch me in reviews, and I guess he was right. I'll keep drinking beers, but I'll always have that hole that will never be filled. Cheers Matt!"
5320,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.62,"Straight brilliant. Nice to have stout that is so well executed, and without a tone of additives. So much going on and all of it from the base beer and barrel."
5321,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.44,2017 drank in 2020. BIG BEER. Tons of bourbon on the nose with caramel and vanilla. Taste follow with a huge hit of bourbon. As it warms oak and caramel toffee notes come out along with dark chocolate. Really complex and a treat to enjoy over a few hours.
5322,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.51,"16 oz can, dated 4/30/21, poured into a teku A- A hazy good orange with a three finger white head  S- Oranges, mango, lime, some sweet malts, papaya, some melons, hints of pineapple, piney, slightly floral. T- Earthy, piney, mango, some melons, oranges touch of lime, some sweet malts, hints of pineapple. M- Smooth, creamy, medium to full body. O- This is a well done NEIPA, but not living up to the hype for me. Maybe being almost 2 months old is a little too old for this beer, maybe this batch just wasn’t as good, but this is not standing out as much as other Tree House beers."
5323,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.85,"Exceptional brew. Nice on the palette, Loaded with flavor. Top 5 brew for me. I find it better than heady topper. Incredible nose on this beer. Complex and unique."
5324,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.49,"Look: very dark brown, some ruby highlights when held to light. Modest mocha head on the pour that mostly subsides. Clingy, oily lacing."
5325,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.6,2018 vintage Taste the dark roasted malt and dark espresso up front then the dark fruits and bittersweet chocolate appear. Definitely get the barrel and booziness in it. Nice viscous mouthfeel and is surprisingly light on palate. Very enjoyable.
5326,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.32,"16 ounce can in an hour glass beer vessel. Dense golden orange juice color. Modest white cap and some lacing. Cool looking can. Dank and resinous. Sweet malt. Orange rind, lemon, and tropical fruit aromas. Orange, grapefruit, and tropical fruit flavors. Berry mix in the back likely from the Mosaic dry hop. Thick and juicy. Hop bitterness with a clean finish. Oily resin. Standout juicer style ipa."
5327,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.37,"Hype machine was pretty dead on here, slight knocks for feel (could be creamier, more lacing) but all in all this one is great. All Citra NEIPAs are some of the best"
5328,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,3.86,"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 12/01/20, code ARTICULATE."
5329,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.1,"Enjoyed at GAB bottle share, 2013 Light fizzy head, thick black beer good legs Nose sweet syrupy thick beer, little roasty cocoa, mild coffee and barrel Taste mild sweet candy but oxidized cardboard, dark choc cocoa, roast and coffee, wet paper, little barrel Mouth is fuller bod, decent carb, little alcohol Overall meh, prob too old and oxidized, wish i could try it fresh"
5330,Green,100,IPA - New England,7.6%,4.6,Another masterpiece from treehouse. Brilliant complex aromas of stone and tropical fruits. Super smooth and easy to drink. Taste is a little less potent than the flavor which makes it so easy going down with a little bit of spiciness that I love.
5331,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.59,L: Bold tangerine and dark orange hues with a thin wispy white head that recedes quickly
5332,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,3.89,"Picked up 2 cases of Treehouse 2 weeks ago. Got 4 of these. Drank one before Trekkies wedding last week. This review is based on that beer. Crack can, looks black inside, pours black outside. Brown head 3/5"" deep. Looks impressive. Found the aroma to be weaker than expected in terms of the coffee presence. Was pretty mild for something rated world class and a ""double shot"" of a name rated the #1 stout in the world (although its 8.2% abv should prolly have it categorized as a double stout, but then it wouldn't be ""#1"" if they did that).  Taste was fine. Delivered on every commercial tug job aspect the beer talks about, yes there is lots of hearty roasted malt, plenty of chocolate malt notes, even plenty of coffee notes from the roasted malt. But the coffee presence itself, I dunno, I've literally had dozens of better coffee beers, much less coffee stouts. Some dude said these were $8 a can, but I don't recall seeing that when I got mine. Mouthfeel was good, alcohol wasn't problematic. I liked it and will look forward to cracking the other 3 cans of it. I dunno, sometimes my nose isn't working good, but I wasn't tasting it either, perhaps I will revise the aroma upward if that is the case."
5333,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,3.31,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Black colour, no head. Aroma of coffee and woodwork. Sweet flavour with loads of coffee, molasses, caramel, oak and vanilla."
5334,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.09,"look: yellow, a little dark smell: mainly pine, taste: follows the smell, pine mostly, maybe some bread, but no fruit feel: smooth, easy to chug, medium body, a little bitter finish overall: I think it's overrated, it's similar with bells two hearted or lawson's sunshine, sunshine is better!"
5335,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.53,Look: Very deep mahogany and very cloudy. Nice deep and creamy head.
5336,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.45,"Right in line with some of the best sours out there. Great taste and feel, but didn't get an outstanding smell from it. Nothing bad, just didn't blow my socks off. Overall, very glad to have tried this one out."
5337,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.64,"Big time grail for me. Vintage 2019 on tap at Bier Station, consumed and reviewed October 2021. Pours black with a finger and a half of dark caramel foam. Good head retention. Aroma is spices, cinnamon, chocolate, toffee, caramel, and molasses. Roasty and toasty malts offer up a firm base, adding a strong malty stout backbone to each whiff. As the sweetness crescendos to a peak, barrel character sweeps in to add some char, bourbon, and bitterness. Alcohol remains an after thought, allowing the beer to shine forward of its ABV. Loaded from first whiff to last sniff. Flavor profile is more of the same - a firm stout base of roasty and toasty malts form the foundation of cinnamon, spices, vanilla, caramel, molasses, toffee, and cream. It opens up less spicy than the nose, but finishes more spicy than the nose, that is to say, the dynamics are shaped in contrast - mirrored. Only caveat to the mirror image is the barrel character notes of char and bourbon that come thru at the end again, dropping this stout an octave into deeper heartiness. Despite the bourbon character popping through the beer, the beer never comes off as hot. Mouth feel is thick with a smooth, consistent grit. Its feel is uniform from front to back. Overall, incredible depth with loads of barrel complimenting the initial spices well. It borders on an ADHD stout, spreading it's attention in a spiderweb of directions, but remains cohesive enough to form an intoxicating melody.  Draft. 8oz pour."
5338,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.51,"Picked up a 750 ml bottle from the Craft Beer Quick Stop 5-27-20 for $22.99. Bottled on 9-26-19, consumed 7-24-20. Beer poured black with a very nice tan head that has some good hang time. Nose is very good, full of medium to heavy roasted malts, a touch of coffee, and a touch of dark fruits. Taste is a huge malt base that lends a prevalent cherry profile, some licorice and a hint of coffee that is really well balanced by what i would imagine a ton of alpha hops. Finishes with a nice touch of heat that could easily miscast this brew as barrel aged. Mouthfeel is very full and very satisfying, the way impy stouts should be! Overall i had always seen this as an over-hyped old guard brew but i am now convinced this is the real deal! Given the high abv and the nice warmth it seems barrel aging is not needed but i do look forward to the BA version of this!"
5339,Anabasis,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.62,"B2 at the cellar. Traded my first bottle(b1) 18 months and 62 trades ago as my first trade. Thanks Morandi, especially enjoyed befuddlement especially, but I'm happy to finally have this puppy tonight! It's dark brown. No bubbles. Smells boozy as booze. Rum booze. Booze good. Stell-ahh! Taste begins with Carmel (autocapitalize as if we're in Carmel by the sea. by the Sea). Quoth my buddy ""the booze kind of dissipates. How does he do that? You're writing this down? I'm getting orange. And then the coconut. You have to mention the coconut. Like a toasted toasted pina colata.""  Me: ""yes! You are killing this beer review. And it has dates."" Buddy thinks I'm taking about romantic dates or a beer named dates. Who would name a beer ""dates?""  Katie of the cellar: ""Yes. review is great. Like ..."" Buddy: ""Is this too much? Are they going to lose this?"" Buddy keeps insisting this is like derivation. This is not like derivation except in how it is thick with goodness.  Mouthfeel is very good. Full and not bubbly. Nor am I. Great beer. Beer is great!"
5340,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.28,"Pours a turbid and opaque color of grapefruit juice with over a finger of head. Surprisingly, the first note that I got on the nose was dankness. Secondary on the nose are the citrus notes.  The flavor is juicy with solid citrusy notes. The finish is pithy and decently bitter.  The body is light for the style and the abv is well-hidden. If motivated, I could slam the whole four-pack. Then, I'd probably fall over."
5341,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.58,"Insanely great stout! Lots of the expected goodies: Choco, coffee- but also the amazing cinnamon. Really good, and much more solid body than the none BA."
5342,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.49,"A: cloudy; pale gold in color; 1 finger finely pored ivory head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing; S: floral first, then pineapple is predominant with several other aromas noticeable as well, including orange and apricot; T: juicy fruit from start to finish; tangerine, red grapefruit, and others are balanced nicely; mild citrus pith bitterness at the end; M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; dry finish; soft; O: another of my absolute favorite Tree House beers;"
5343,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.65,Look: Hazy light orange color with no head
5344,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.46,Lots of apricot with a moderate funk to the aroma. Sweet apricots mix with funky and musty sourness in the taste. A little sharp in the finish. Excellent overall.
5345,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.13,"Thanks to intecwrx for this 12 oz. can. My very special old jacket was my first black leather motorcycle jacket, which protected me from my first motorcycle crash. It looked bad ass with those skid marks across the right shoulder. My shoulder, not so much.  The pour is very dark brown with Shanda Fay highlights. Nose is surprisingly weak – or is that subtle – with dark fruit & what I’d assume was brandy if I couldn’t read.  V.S.O.J. How is this not brandy barrel aged? Because that’s what I get: rich alcohol, dark, fleshy fruit, caramel, brown sugar, sharp oak, molasses, damn there’s a lot going on in here. Sticky, denser than Michael A****** (name redacted). Like Fay, once in a night is enough.  Yet another beer that falls into the “after dinner liqueur” category, ‘Jacket is decadent like a 007 yacht. Less the considerable hype, this is still an excellent beer."
5346,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.46,"16oz can dated 1/4/20. Pours cloudy gold with a minimal head or retention. Dank and tropical in the nose. Mango, guava, peach, grapefruit, and weed. Medium bodied with a creamy, soft mouthfeel. Lush, ripe, juicy citrus on the palate. Unripe peach, mango, and grapefruit. Finishes dry with zero malt and a firm bitterness."

5348,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.56,"Outstanding BA stout. It’s got tons of chocolatey sweetness and a very pronounced, but not dominating barrel character. The bourbon blends perfectly with the big malty flavors of dark fruit, and chocolate. The mouthfeel is super thick and coating, perfect for the style. Overall I’ll be making the effort to get this again, it’s great."
5349,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.59,"Poured into a Hoof Teku. Smell is strong with lots of citrus coming through. Graperfruit, papaya, some orange. Taste follows suit. Absolutely excellent triple IPA. Unbelievably smooth, does not feel like 11.5% at all."
5350,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.56,"Best by date: 07/02/24. Tasted 1/4/21. Finally did a side-by-side blind taste test with St. Bernardus' Abt 12 Abbey Ale and their Christmas Ale. Overall, I preferred Abt 12, although both were great. The Christmas Ale was actually a touch smoother and easier to quaff. But Abt 12 had more of a potent aroma and more spiciness and depth of flavor. Really a wonderful beer overall, especially for those chilly winter nights."

5352,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.88,"A: This pours pitch black and oily and has a sticky, thicc dark-khaki head.  S: Definitely getting the espresso on the nose. Vanilla comes through, as does roastyness.  T: Whoa... so much going on here. First off is an explosion of rich coffee and vanilla. It's not overly roasty, which is good in my opinion. Lots of toffee. I love the vanilla-forward flavor. Burnt caramel and molasses show up too. It's sweet but rich and roasty at the same time.  M: Very thick and sticky. A little cloying but in a good way. That burnt caramel and coffee and vanilla linger around for a while. This beer is giving me coffee breath!  O: So glad I found this! I almost didn't buy it because I didn't want an overly-roasted coffee flavored beer (this happened in the recent past -- $23 gone down the drain). Anyway, this lives up to the hype. It'll bring more than just a caffe americano flavor profile. I liken it to a coffee/vanilla-infused Marshall Zhukov -- has the same thickness and feel, and the base stout seems to bring just about the same flavors. Very impressed by this."
5353,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.19,"Taster and shot-ski at brewery. For a big triple IPA, it’s pretty smooth, almost seems harmless. Goes down very easy, hoppy, but not much evidence of the high ABV. Light golden, mild haze, small fluffy head. Here’s a beer you could drink until...you realized what you were drinking. Tasty."
5354,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.62,"Another vibes outing from Shared, this time with coconut. Shared with the Mrs., this pours pitch black, with a dark tan head if aggressive. Wife had a good amount of coconut ""floaties"". Strong malt bill on the nose, intermixed with coconut and a hint of alcohol. Very big and rich on the palate, with a flavor that coats the mouth and stays. Once again, there is a bit of coconut, but I was also pleasantly surprised with a good amount of chocolate. Overall, very enjoyable."
5355,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.77,Incredible Russian Imperial Stout. Amazing barrel characteristics. Great body. Over all one of the best Barrel Aged Stouts I've had. I must say that I feel like Barrel Aged Dark Lord is just as good or better at a quarter of the price though...
5356,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.1,"Golden and hazy with no visible carbonation. Topped with a finger of yellowish head. Smells of grapefruit, grass, orange juice, a hint of evergreen, heated hop resin and a hint of paint thinner. Amazing taste, certainly get the alcohol on the end but very orange juice, hoppy, resinous, and turpentine forward, with hints of green leaf. Its slightly sweet with a grapefruit pith bitterness.  Medium feeling body, with moderate, foamy carbonation, and an alcohol burn in the throat.  Got this at Trillium Brewing Co in Boston. Drinking up in Canada by Lake Muskoka, Feb 1st, 2018."
5357,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.14,"Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a thick dark brown to motor oil black color with a finger's worth of tan foamy head that slid off at a mild pace. Some stringy lace concaved at the sides."
5358,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.4,"Revisited with the 2018 bourbon barrel Adam June 07th, 2021 Murky, dark brown body; no head. Big earthy aroma of oak with a twinge of bourbon; cocoa. Richly sweet taste oozing with cocoa, molasses, and muted whiskey. Heavy body; slick and oily; slippery; bold residual sugars coat the palate; sweet mouthfeel overall offset with a low-key boozy warmth. I find this version of Adam to be very similar to the 2015 rye version. Perhaps because I'm a bourbon man, the taste really appeals to me a tad more. Regardless, this is one beautiful monster of a beer. Poured at 55° F. -------------------- Original review ratings for rye 2015 version: 4.0 4.0 4.5 4.5 4.25 Originally reviewed June 06th, 2021 Dark, murky brown body; initially no head then a thin wispy ring circles the glass. Rich smell; dark pitted fruit, anise and leather; mild earthy spiciness. Outstanding taste; like a rich port; cocoa and plum plus raisin with a subdued booziness. Heavy body; slick and oily; coats the palate with a slippery sweetness. The old bugaboo with high ABV beers having little head retention exist here; but then, it's nearly six years old. Otherwise, the taste and mouthfeel are exceptional for the style. The beer is rich and complex overall. Late note: I see on the bourbon bottle that Adam is produced with no carbonation, so I bumped up the appearance score from 3.5 to 4.0 and upped the overall to 4.25. Served at 54° F; rye bourbon barrel version (2015)"
5359,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.65,"Bottled December 2016. Released a few months ago AFAIKT. A: Pours black with a smattering of espresso-like tan head and dots of lacing. A fine ring persists for most of the glass. S: Rich, very dark roast coffee, light roast, and dark chocolate bar meld effortlessly with toasted oak, vanilla bean, sweetish bourbon, and a soupçon of cola. Slight spirit-y note. T: Sweetish dark chocolate, light bourbon, and dark coffee (less prominent than the nose). Mild tannic and toasted oak alongside light vanilla. A pretty hefty dose of sweetness positions this more as a dessert beer than anything else. Hides the alcohol remarkably well.  M: Full, thick body with light carbonation. Slight warming note.  O: An absolutely delicious, flavorful dessert beer. Dialing back the sweetness, which limits how much of this I can drink in one session to about 8 oz, just a bit would put this alongside the best BA Speedway variants in terms of world class BA stouts."

"
5361,Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.63,"A glorious, dark chocolate, thick, almost black look. No head at all, sparse froth along time of glass. Looks like a gloriously dark cup of coffee. The smell is delicious! Coffee and chocolate perfection dance in the nose. Rich caramel notes appear as well. The taste is extraordinary! Rich, sweet dark chocolate, with mild coffee and buttery mouthfeel. Vanilla beans add warmth and comfort to the mouth, in a subtle manner. Chili peppers are not forward and present themselves, just barely after crawling up the throat. Just an ever since slight heat. The feel, is silky and rich, but not heavy. This is an excellent beer and would be perfect for and after dinner desert. Mmmm, it’s delicious!"
5362,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.25,"Pours golden straw color with perfect foamy head. Strong citrus aroma with some dankness. Great citrusy hop flavor. Medium bodied. Overall a great ipa from OH, would buy again. 3/18/20"
5363,Black Gold,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,3.96,"Black without foam. N/A Alcohol flavor is a plus. No roast or char, plenty of wood/barrel. Reads as an old ale more than a stout. Not that thick, hot finish though and bitter is a knock."
5364,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.62,"Prairie Pirate Paradise Imperial Stout, 13% ABV. Pours black with a ring of brown bubbles, typical for a Prairie stout. Nose is rum, coconut, and chocolate. Taste follows, plus coffee, with moderate bitterness. Decent mouthfeel, if slightly under-carbonated, overall world-class."
5365,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,3.38,"Growler @ Mike’s. Black in color with a khaki head. Spicy coffee aroma. A little bit of green pepper to it, but a lot of nice dried blueberry, hazelnut, maple, and vanilla. Sweet caramel flavor to it. A good bit of roast and cocoa powder. Somewhat on the bitter side, actually. A fair amount of coffee grounds. Not bad, but could be better."
5366,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.56,"Very good head production, considering the sky high ABV and double barrel aging. Quickly fades, as expected, leaving behind only a thin ring of foam around the edge. Body is surprisingly clear and cola-colored. Boozy nose - whoda thunkit? The smell of bourbon, port, and brown sugar wafts over you from the pour itself. Up close it's similar but stronger: red grape, molasses, chocolate, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, honeycomb. Strong, sweet, and boozy on the palate, with an alcoholic burn that grows and grows. Very slow sipper. Lasting heat in the throat and chest. Incredibly deep and complex, rich and dark. Molasses, brown sugar, oak, bourbon mash, red grape, white bread, light toast, toffee, vanilla, espresso. Long aftertaste, although the booze understandably dissipates rather quickly."

A beautiful black appearance accompanied with a wonderful smell of chocolate. Nice head retention which is a light brown. Smooth maple and chocolate flavor finish with lingering hints of chocolate fudge which is kind of pleasant to the pallet.
5371,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.45,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a taster. Thanks Brandon for sharing this.  Sweet coffee, vanilla, cocoa, caramel roasty , a little plastic on the aroma. Lighter body than expected."
5372,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,3.83,"Pouring from a 375 ml. bottle into a tall wine glass. Bottle dated 3/01/18. This beer pours out light straw/lemon in color. And forms a thick white crown. The smell is some fruit sweetness and tartness. Peaches, apples, pears. The taste is sharp and ripe fruit and a slight funk. Almost has a burning like tartness. I am just really not coming out impressed with these Russian Rivers I have tried. I wish I was but it's just not adding up to me. I've had better sours than this. I want more complexity, more flavor. Idk just not adding up to me the ratings."

5375,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.46,"Foggy burnt gold with a fuzzy white blanket that recedes to a thin ring. Having just had Jammy b2 before popping this cork, the aroma here features significantly more funk and complexity by comparison, with barnyard hay and straw, lightly stinky nutty cheese, and toast, all sufficiently met by juicy peach and apricot. Taste is more peachy than smell, featuring a stupid amount a drippy peach with a soft froth and a tingly semi-dry finish. Bottled 10/13/17"
5376,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.42,"Getting coconut on the taste cold. It seems to be that way fresh with some of the Fremont barrel-aged beers? Warmer, I get more of the coffee and cinnamon."
5377,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.49,"Look: Dark liquid, like black coffee. Camel leather colored head that was short in height and slowly melted to a thin ring around the glass with moderate lacing."
5378,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.43,Poured into a tulip glass via draft Color is a lemony yellow with haze Smell is dank citrus and pine..pungent  Taste is lemon and orange peel Carbonation is high Mouthfeel is full Top shelf DIPA
5379,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.6,"10/2015 - huge hoppiness, tangerine, big malts, ethanol on the nose; dank, pine flavors pair nicely with more tangerine, orange zest; surprisingly dry, lightly bitter finish, with a touch of heat in the back. I like this more than Pliny the Younger for sure."
5380,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.54,"One of the most wonderfully aromatic IPAs outside of the northeast! Alpine IPAs never fail to deliver, and this bad boy (ho!) is no exception! The bottle creeped me out a little bit, but I won't hold that against such a delicious DIPA."
5381,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.21,"Picked up a 12 oz bottle from Kings Beer & Wine 12-18-19 for $12.99. Bottled 7-18-19; consumed 3-26-20. Beer poured black as night with a nice tan head with the original pour. Nose is a combination of rum, chocolate, and vanilla. Taste is a huge malt base infused with cocoa nibs, rum from the barrel, and chili peppers kicking in along with a subtle vanilla. Finishes sweet but balanced to hold of cloying, Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Overall a fun beer to try once as it is not for the faint of palate!"
5382,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.45,"Finally trying this one, march 28 2021, bottled 10-3-18. For me the feel is just outstanding, full and creamy and smooth, approaching syrupy, but still with enough carbonation to keep it drinkable. It’s Hill Farmstead, of course the feel is going to be exceptional. The aroma is strangely mild but the flavor explodes with maple syrup and whiskey notes and has to be the sweetest of any HF beer I can recall. Just lean enough to stay in balance. Very nice drinking."
5383,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,3.97,"Bottle, RBNAG 2009 in Vatlandsvåg. Pitch black colour, low brown head. Complex aroma, chocolate, coffee, soy sauce, prunes. Full and rich flavour, loads of malty sweetness, also some fruitiness, loads of chocolate and caramel, notes of coffee."
5384,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.44,"16oz can, breaking in the new Trillium snifter. Bright hazy golden yellow body, one finger frothy and thick latte white head, plenty of retention, lots of lacing. Looks positively appetizing. Smell is massive Galaxy aromatics- tropical fruit, grapefruit, mild herbal spice, floral notes, mild caramel. The honey isn't really present here on the nose, but on the palate, it's there in spades at the end and finish, for sure. It's a wonderful mild honey sweetness that lingers for a while. Mild-moderate spicy bitterness, otherwise big but relatively balanced galaxy and caramel malt. This is pretty delicious, and the honeyed finish is really, really very nice. Medium fuller bodied, good carbonation, silky smooth with a slight dry floral and herbal resin that is supplanted by a mild lingering sweet honey."
5385,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.47,"Good lord is this a boozy beast. I decided, probably in error, to drink a bottle by myself on a Tuesday evening. I had two Grey Mondays gathering dust in my cellar - and no one ever wants to open these at shares, so I thought I might start thinning the herd. Full disclosure: I only finished one glass before falling asleep. Appearance brings to mind a barleywine, more than a stout - Grey Monday pours a deep reddish brown and smells tremendously boozy. Seriously, this stuff makes my head swim. Hazelnuts are faint in the nose, but there's definitely a bit of warm nuttiness there. It's quite sweet and fairly sticky, thick, and oily.  While Bruery stouts aren't my every day go-to, it's difficult to deny them accolades - these beers are nuts. Delicious, but they just aren't practical when drinking alone!"
5386,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,100,Barleywine - American,17%,4.01,"The big man brought out all the barrel aged versions back in October. Cheers!  From a 37,5cl bottle into a tasting glass.  37 degrees Plato"
5387,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.49,"Poured into a tulip glass. Avery clear golden color with a medium white head. Aroma was as white wine, lemon, and stone fruit. The taste followed with a tart cherry flavor and floral notes. A clean dry backbone. Overall a fantastic beer."
5388,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.74,"05/2015 - Love the huge cognac aromas, raisin and plum, a slight maple, subtle hoppy aromas; sweet, honey, boozy, caramel, dank hops, and more plum and some tobacco too; chewy mouthfeel with flavors of raisin, tobacco, dark chocolate, and cognac lingering."
5389,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.59,"5/2/19 (Chicago): $12.47 12 oz. can prepaid purchase for January 2019 Haymarket brewery release, canned 12/28/18 and poured into snifter. Black pour, carbonation prevalent, tax head quickly dissipates living fine lacing. This release is 12% abv and labeled a barrel aged stout with raspberries. Raspberry aroma strong, nice balance with bourbon, overall sweet aroma. Taste mirrors aroma, raspberries are excellent, well blended taste with offsetting mellow but strong bourbon taste and roasted malt, tart cherry in the mix. Outstanding Stout! Slight fizzy carbonation, somewhat thin texture for a stout, nice and easy smooth drinking. Glad I poured this on a cold and rainy May Chicago evening."
5390,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.33,"I've had several different vintages over the years from 2015 to 2020 and it's varied quite a decent amount. Unfortunately, I feel as the years have progressed, it's a lost of the vanilla bomb characteristics and it's become boozier, more oaky and bourbon forward and carbonated in mouthfeel, with the most recent year having a cherry-like flavor. Overall, decently thick body with a bit of cocoa brownie batter and hint of vanilla."
5391,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.63,"Vertical of 13' 16' 19'  13 was the best with it's age, then 16 and 19. These guys are great with some age on them. Very distinct between the 3 . 13 is drinking great right now. 19 needs some time. 13 was definitely the best with it's Musty mustard seed funk. Still tart with light carbonation."
5392,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.68,"Pours a beautiful deeper yellow with fluffy white head that is almost sustained by the influx of bubbles from beneath. Funk funk funk on the nose, with a kiss of sweet. There is an initial sweet, that then spreads out into a more earthy flavor, that evolves into a tart finish, with a slight acidic reaction from the 'ol personal heartburn detector. Very good take on the style."
5393,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.26,"L-Hazy, cloudy......1 inch head........color is like an autumn leaf.......not brown not yellow but somewhere in between......not very attractive S-Aroma is faint......some tropical hops.........mostly mango T-Great tasting........flavors are bright.......orange, lemon, mango, tangerine, passionfruit.......lots of fruit juice F-Less than medium.......slick.......carb is moderate......ABV undetectable O-Great tasting brew that tastes much better than it looks........would buy again"
5394,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.0,"Pours pitch black with tan head. Aroma is as expected. Roast, spice and booze. Flavor was a tad shallow. I was expecting more bold flavors considering. Overall, I expected more. Still, solid for what it is."
5395,Coconut B-Bomb,99,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.45,"L: Pours a thick black with a small to medium tan head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. S: Toasted coconut delights the nose, followed by bourbon, vanilla, some oak, notes of leather, caramel and toffee, some chocolate and dark stone fruit. Lots going on but smells very inviting. T: Lots of bourbon, vanilla and oak, with some leather, dark cherries, chocolate and caramel and toffee, a nice natural toasted coconut adds to the balance. Booze is noticeable but not as noticeable as I expected based on the abv. F: Smooth slick body, mouthfeel is medium, not quite as big as expected. O: This is a a very nice Bourbon barrel aged winter ale."
5396,Peche 'n Brett,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,10%,4.44,"500mL/16.9oz bottle purchased at Nectar in Kendall Yards, Spokane, Washington, for $17.90. ""Batch no: 2019. Bottle date: 03/2019 WA."" Now 8.5% abv, btw. Abbreviated review.  Last time I had a beer from Logsdon, they were being brewed by a different brewer for a different owner in a different state. What's different? Not much. Still a great beer. Want some fruit and funk? Look no further."
5397,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.16,"Dark viscous used motor oil black with a dark tan fizzy blanket that slowly reduces and thickens, specked with surprisingly large, thick white chunks, of...cocoa butter? coconut? Wtf? Smell is sweet, decadent and indulgent, and it really hits the notes of the inspirational namesake. Chocolate, vanilla, and cake. Hints of fudge, coconut, nuts, and even cake batter...flour or egg or something, which, even though it's seductive, is very odd. I mean, it really smells like a coconut pecan frosted German chocolate cake...like wtf? I mean I didn't want it to be so good, to be honest...the Coffee-mate creamer beer trend has me questioning authenticity and ingredient usage--seriously, what's going on here? But, I just can't deny it smells delicious. Annnnd on the tongue, IGCCS is rigoddamndiculously decadent and rich, with sweet chocolateyness all the hell over this thing and smooth fluffy vanilla cake notes. I also get a little mocha coffee and a hint of sweet, fresh coconut frosting. However, this beer is so insane that there's a cloying, throat coating Robitussin aftertaste long after the swallow...and because it's so sweet, you have to give it a good break between sips or else you're in for a sugar migraine, so it's inevitable you'll get this aftertaste. Feel is really smooth, luscious and over the top slick with a nice medium-thin froth while keeping a surprisingly semi-dry, but sticky finish."
5398,Blåbær Lambik,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.54,"2014 750ml. Had a quarter pour side by side with a myriad of other blueberry beers. Big take away was I surprised how soft and not sour this was. Tart yes and still got that Cantillon funk. Got more berry flavor as it warmed. I've heard this beer is really over-hyped and compared to the other blueberry beers out there I still think this is a very special beer. Maybe bluberry sours in general are just not as flavorful and jammy as raspberry, cherry, apricot, etc. Proabably wouldn't seek it out again but was still a great beer to have."
5399,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.79,Sweet and smooth. Dark pour. Loads of fresh-roast coffee on the nose. Dark chocolate on the tongue. An amazing beer! Can / Nonic pint glass / No food pairing
5400,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.33,"2016 bottle - wish I would have drank it fresh. It’s not bad, but there’s very little on the seeet side to balance out a pretty intense coffee flavor.  Checks all the boxes, but sadly there are comparable beers I can grab on the shelf."
5401,Sang Noir,99,Wild Ale,9.3%,4.28,"Dark brown with an amber tinge when held to the light, topped with 4 fingers of orangey beige head. Smells sour of balsamic vinegar, funk, earthy, heather, leather, and slightly fruity of cherries and dates. Sour smoothness. Sour of lemons, balsamic vinegar, lightened by an absent or phantom sweetness, cherries, funk, cellar, leather and peat.  Medium, acidic and dry body with a smooth, foamy, and light feel to it. 2015 Project. Got in Rochester, NY, drinking in New Hamburg, ON, July 28th, 2018. Excellent for the style!"
5402,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.47,"Bottled 12/24/20, opened 2/14/21. Pours black with no head. The nose is coconut frosting and soy sauce. Equal parts sweet coconut/vanilla/dark chocolate and savory depth. The taste follows. Coconut, vanilla, dark chocolate, soy sauce, and bourbon. The mouthfeel is medium+ with light carb. Overall, very good. A tasty blend of dessert and bourbon."
5403,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.22,"Pours a lively mahogany hue with thin, tight, off-white band around the edges. Nose expresses smokey notes, molasses and brown sugar. Taste follows nose - sweet and cloying, but not in a bad way in theses circumstances and the cognac barrel (wood and spirits) comes forth in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium in body with an almost still carbonation and an oily texture. Overall, nothing short of amazing. I just wish the price point wasn't so dear."
5404,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.51,L: Deep Ruby in Color. Thin pink head that dissipates quickly
5405,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,"2012 bottle. Was absolutely delicious. Great mouth feel, so smooth, silky taste, smelled great. bourbon on the nose very little bite on the taste. Very thick look on the pour."
5406,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.28,"16oz. can into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. Shared with schen9303.  Nose is chocolate, cream, lactose, and cold brew coffee. Some cocoa powder and peanut butter ashiness in the back. Nice. Actually more subtle than I thought it would be. Beer opens chocolate, mocha, and lactose. Super creamy. Peanut butter shows up in the middle complemented by coffee and a very light, roasty tartness. Finishes more roasted malt, chocolate and fudge with a lactose, milk, and vanilla finish. Body is medium with low carbonation. Slick and soft on the palate and goes down silky smooth and rich. Sticky, lingering aftertaste. Shockingly drinkable.  This one's quite nice. Peanut butter could be a touch more pronounced but this is the prototypical Tree House milk stout."
5407,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.46,"Another superb SP fruited sour - eff yes! Awesome apricot, peach abound; yet not acidic whatsoever; nice tartness in the back of the palate; creamy, slightly sweet, and just crushable AF."
5408,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.5,"Cloudy orange haze. Lots of tropical fruit and citrus. Very mild spice. Hefty orange and grapefruit, nice juice quotient, medium lighter caramel, oats, medium fuller bodied with soft carbonation, very mild floral and zesty bitterness. Great stuff."
5409,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.77,"Really hope they make this again. Coffee, chocolate fudge, vanilla, maple, bourbon - just everything to make KBS even better. Don't skip this one if you see it. Worth every penny."
5410,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.44,"Had on tap. Dark, brooding and smooth. Pour jet black and viscous with slight brown foam that quickly dissipates. Has a bitter bite to awaken the drinker from the smooth and tranquil body. Molasses and rye bitters combine with the bourbon, brown sugar, caramel, chocolate and licorice sweetness to make a full flavor complexion. Smell is bourbon and rye forward."
5411,Vanilla Bean Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.84,"This was opened at Perennial today and drank with KBBS, BA Abraxas, and Fuzzy. Small 2-3 oz pour from the 12oz 2013 vintage bottle into a snifter. A - Dark obviously like every other solid stout out there with decent lacing. Looks thick and vicious in appearance and definitely stains the glass. S - Small notes of vanilla with chocolate as well as light notes of whiskey. Hard to compare because I have not had regular assassin but smell is pretty damn good T - Taste follows the nose although the vanilla is somewhat muted. It blends in with the milk and dark chocolate flavors that come through from the base. Definitely some hints of coffee in there and some bourbon on the finish although it is not that prevalent. M - Mouthfeel is pretty thick and vicious, not as thick as KBBS and MD but it is definitely a thicker BA stout which I love O - Glad I was lucky enough to get to try this along the KBBS and the other fine brews that were drank today. Thanks again Cory"
5412,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.58,"poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. pours a lovely hazy gold with bright white foam. strong lacing on this one. smell is an exquisite mix of dank resin, ripe fruitiness and a slight bit of pine. such a complex aroma for a single hop beer. taste is dank and fruity with nice bitterness. overripe melon and resin. so well balanced. feel is smooth, creamy and full. this is an amazing DIPA. complex yet drinkable. enjoyable the whole way through. pure Mosaic bomb."
5413,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.5,"Excited to have this one after hearing about it for so long, and it did not disappoint. Foreboding opaque black with a thin oatmeal colored head. Smell hits all the right notes: espresso, huge chocolate, vanilla, barley and smooth malt. The tastes is dark and powerfully creamy, the chocolate is heavy, the espresso lifts with the vanilla, there is some nuts and caramel under the surface, and the malts don't come across as super roasted, rather they are smooth and super heavy. This beer sits in the gut like a brick, but the body is creamy, somewhat airy, and frothy"
5414,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,5.0,"Perfect slighly hazy golden color. Was extremely active in the bottle before pouring. The smell was pleasantly funky and tart...you can smell it the second it pours. The taste blew me away...zero flaws as far as I'm concerned. Everything good about Arthur with the added complexity and tartness from the wine barrels. Even has a bit of vanilla flavor in the aftertaste which was very nice. Less carbed than I was expecting and that's not a bad thing...almost creamy, which I didn't expect either but I really really enjoy. This may just be the best beer I've ever had. Wish I could drink this every day."
5415,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,3.84,"On-draught at Verdugo Bar, Los Angeles. I've waited a long time to try this one. 30cl for $8 USD. 8% ABV. Imperial IPA. Pours a glowing orange body of average vibrance. No yeast or lees are visible. Head is white, coating, and thick. Head retention is good for the high ABV - ~8 minutes. Leaves scattered lacing on the sides of the glass as the head recedes. AROMA: Orange creamsicle, fresh orange peel, fragrant citrus, a blip of rind, tangerine. Has concomitant bitterness but it's nevertheless well balanced. Suggests an imperial IPA with a well-disguised ABV, plenty of hop pungency, and good depth of flavour. Aromatic intensity is average. I'm eager to try it. Very fresh and vivid. TASTE: Undertones of orange creamsicle and candied citrus peel (orange, tangerine, maybe even mango) underscore this fresh citrusy brew. Juicy but adequately bitter, with pale malts keeping the hops in check, resulting in an impressively well balanced beer. Good depth of flavour. Above average flavour duration and intensity. I wouldn't say it's complex, but there is some intricate layering of citrusy flavours that amounts to a beer with a nice diversity of citrusy flavours. Exceeds the sum of its parts, but it's far from the most busy imperial IPA out there. Nitpicking, it could be more vivid, fresh, and/or juicy, but it's very well-balanced as is. MOUTHFEEL: Creamy, soft, medium to full-bodied, smooth, wet. Not oily, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy. Well-carbonated. OVERALL: Ludicrously drinkable for an 8% imperial IPA. Its balance really sets it apart. I can see why it's regarded as one of the very best in the style, and it showcases its hop selection extremely well. Up there with Alpine-brewed Alpine beers in my estimation, and very well executed, but I'd balk at the idea of waiting in line for it.  One of the best expressions of the style I've tried to date, but I can imagine it better. If orange creamsicle IIPAs are your bag but you want more bitterness and hop pungency than the hazy IPA fad offers without the yogurty tang of a Hill Farmstead expression of the style, this is the beer for you. Really damn tasty. B+ (3.84) / VERY GOOD"
5416,Double Nelson,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.4,"Had on tap. Cloudy dirty gold body with a thick white foam ring. Love the nelson sauvin hop and love what HF has done with them. Grape must, earthy hops, lemon zest, peach, slight grass, black pepper, and mango aromas. Taste has the same flavors but the malt meets them all in a dry cracker way, the combination gives the beer a dry, resinous, and elevated finish. Smell delivers more on the promise of the hops. Feel captures the dry earthiness in a matrix of a neipa, good juicy orange and yellow fruits."
5417,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.39,Big chocolate bomb and very tasteful.
5418,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.6,"Bottled 2011, Opened May, 2020"
5419,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.83,"750ml bottle - 2015 vintage Pours pitch black with a creamy brown foam head. Smells strongly of wood and oak, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, dark toffee, caramelized brown sugar, molasses, dried dark fruits, raisin, fig, coffee, dark chocolate, with earthy herbal grassy pine. Tastes pretty exquisite with a great blend of aforementioned flavors, oak barrel, bourbon, vanilla, caramel swirl, maple, dark toffee, caramelized brown sugar, molasses, dried dark fruits, raisin, fig, dark chocolate, roasted coffee, with earthy herbal grassy pine. Feels medium bodied, creamy and smooth with moderate low carbonation. Overall a real nice and rich bourbon barrel aged imperial coffee stout."
5420,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,3.26,"Mostly maple with some coffee. Has a metallic flavor to it. Reminds of waffle crisp cereal, you know, it’s not too bad but leaves an after taste that seems really fake maple. Did not enjoy this very much, prefer Hipster Brunch by quite a bit for a beer with these adjuncts. Finished half the bottle and then went on to something else."
5421,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.06,"A true imperial pale ale. Wouldn't want to drink two back to back. A little too chewy/syrupy/boozy for my current tastes, but that's more about the style than this specific example which is very well done."
5422,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,3.9,"Tasted from bottle. Pours a cloudy orangish gold with thick white head. Aroma is sour, fruity, champagne. Taste is moderately sour but not overly so. Nice fruity tart flavor. Apples, lemon, yeast flavors. Crisp and tart on the palate. I'm not a huge sour fan but this is very well done."
5423,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,5.0,"2016 vintage from 22 oz bottle, 13.4% abv. From Quality Liquor Store out of San Diego, CA. Beautiful and unique dirty amber color. First served around 45 degrees F, the beer just explodes with flavor. Smells similar to the best imperial stouts but immediately informs you it is in fact a barleywine upon first drink. Very lovely on the palate. Blooming yellow-brown head that disappears almost entirely as quickly as it came. The booze greets you with every drink, unyielding. Which is a good thing. Think ""W00TSTOUT aged in delicate wines"" and you're on your way to an idea of what it's like. After warming the sharpness of the mouthfeel starts to subside (a bit)."
5424,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,3.85,"This was poured as part of a blind vanilla share. 2019 vintage. Surprisingly ethanol on the nose and on the taste. Vanilla is present and still tastes pretty good, but I do believe this to be overrated."
5425,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,5.0,Ordered this at a bar after the previous IPA ran out while on vacation. Was pleasantly surprised at the amount of aroma and flavor from this beer with a bright citrus flavor and enough malty sweetness to balance out the back end. Was able to find a couple packs of it at a local package shop to take home to enjoy. Highly recommend this beer!
5426,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.48,This is a great NEIPA. Departs from some of the standards but is still a great beer. I appreciate the level of bitterness as it balances the immense pineapple and papaya that the hops give off.

5428,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.61,"(16 oz can, 8.3% abv, 04/13/21; purchased at TH by my brother; kept stored away cold till today... poured in stages into Trillium fat tulip) L: milky, yellow-light amber liquid; tall, expansive, glossy foam, rocky in its receding, lasting long S: musky pineapple rind, dried pineapple out of the gate... as the head breaks down, a peculiar peppered dough note... when the liquid shows on the surface, citrus burst... alcohol rather buried, though a soft floral perfume wafts in the ether... later it gets catty, and likely the most catty character I've ever sniffed... 3D expressions, at any rate T: lightly-oxidized pineapple, fruit-ed cereal flakes... lightly-earthy, subtly-peppery, vaguely mango finish... lime-drenched grapefruit note in the aftertaste... third sip starts as nilla wafer, then morphs into a tropical, leafy bitterness... fourth and fifth sips, it becomes clear this is one of the better-balanced NEIPAs between grain milk and hop nuance, a perfect marriage... the alcohol does start to open up and emanate in the aftertaste about halfway through, accentuating and mutating certain hop elements... it's almost malty tiki by the end... honestly, what incredible flavor development over the course of every few sips F: attenuated, numbing nectar... delicately viscous, stealthily buoyant... slight resinous, residual drag in the finish... by the end, the tonic booze is just stoking the hearth of my face... I don't enjoy the sluggish milk, and this is anything but O: I'll have to reference my other TH reviews, but this (especially being a nasty pineapple ho) is one of the better/best NEIPAs I've tried... bitter, strident (booze), dynamic, sharply-shaped, B.O.-tiful... my bro has been hooking it up, but I might need to make a special trip up Mass-way to snag some of this myself (1768)"
5429,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,5.0,"This is plain and simple one AMAZING beer! It hits all all notes...Nice flavor all the way through...Vanilla, Strawberry and Chocolate. The balance, the taste, the mouth feel...and pretty much everything else are dead on. The HYPE is real and this beer is worth it. Rarely do I find myself saying that :) Had the chance to try this twice and it amazed me both times!!!!!"
5430,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.99,"Draft at DLD and on draft 2 days later at FFF. Dark dark dark appearance. No foamhead except for caramel colored ring on the edge of glass. Cinnamon, bourbon, some chocolate and even a slight bit of jamminess. Taste follows the nose. Good bit of cinnamon but not overpowering other ingredients. Chocolate is present and some jam quality too. GOOD bourbon note and a very sticky thick mouthfeel. As someone who’s had the past four Marshmallow Handjees and many other DL variants, this just may be the best one: Chemtrailmix 2018. Also, this dwarfs BA Abraxas 17 I had and makes the BA Abraxas taste one dimensional and lacking in barrel presence. Top 5 beers I’ve had all time... easily."
5431,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.5,"Had a 2015 vintage Honestly expected more raspberry in the taste and nose. As the Cantillon employee said it was their finest lambic with not 200 grams, but 300 grams of raspberry per liter Lou pepe. Nevertheless still a great beer. Cantillon does not have any bad beers"

5433,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.31,Serving: Can
5434,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.8,"2017/18 bottle. Pours a deep, lush red with very little foam. Smell is robustly tart with big washings of ripe raspberries, blackberries and some lemon. Taste. Well, the taste is just wow. This hits the tongue with a brash and potent sourness and acidity, really opening the nostrils and gets the salivating going. You can really feel the acidity in the jaw and your tastebuds just beg for an encore. Sip number two presents the FRAMBOOS with a huge pop of raspberries and blackberries. Hints of vinegar, but stays just on the right side of the line. By now, I'm practically drooling and having to restrain myself from just chugging the remainder of this 45 dollar bottle. Every sip just opens up the complexity and notes of funk, hay, lemon and grass come through, but the stars of the show are the raspberries. Juicy and summery and just the right ripeness. This is a stunning, stunning beer. Mouthfeel is thin and sparkly, almost champagney. Overall, this is the best raspberry beer I've ever had, even surpassing Rose de Gambrinus, which ranks in my all time top five. This is as good as sours get."
5435,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.75,"Traded in NC for a bottle. No visible date Look- Poured into a tulip. A thin brownish-tan head which faded quickly. The little lacing and some stickiness in places. Smell- Lots of caramel, chocolate, and vanilla. I was expecting more coffee and the barrel, but it just was not there. The smell was fantastic either way. Taste- The caramel, chocolate, and vanilla blend was phenomenal. The bourbon was a little more prevalent as it warmed and the coffee showed up more toward the end of the pour.  Mouthfeel- Nice and smooth with just enough carbonation. No idea this one clocked in at 12%. Overall- A fantastic stout with a rich blend. Highly recommend."
5436,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.36,"Pours like muddy water. If I had made a home brew that looked like this then nobody would drink it. The smell was the best part fresh citrus, mango and grass. No malt character to be found in this beer. If you like munching on a bag of hops then this is your beer."
5437,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.25,Batch 1. 2015 vintage; drank 11/18/17 @ the Yarchives.  Cloudy orange appearance.  Minimal white head; minimal lace.  Burnt wheat & mild peach notes in the nose.  Medium mouthfeel.  Peach jam & mild smoke flavors; a faintly tart finish. Refreshing & easy to enjoy.
5438,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.5,"Finally got a four pack for $22 from Liquor Cabinet on Hilltop Road in St. Joseph, Michigan on February 18th, 2018. Was worth the wait! Outstanding beer very near as good as the great ones like KBS, Goose Island BCBS, and Bells Black Note."
5439,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.56,2017 Bottle: 
5440,Grey Monday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,4.62,An aroma of booze and hazelnut. A bit of heat in the taste but with this high ABV how could there not be? I like the mild carbonation. This is creamy goodness. I even loved the aroma they put in the wax!
5441,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.0,"I don't know about this one... the strong ABV negatively offsets the ""sunny"" taste. Two weeks old and it shouldn't be this boozy. For my money - and opinion - the original ""Sips"" is significantly better."
5442,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.56,"Can dated 9/15/20. Poured into a small tasting glass. L: Dirty Julius S: ""Juice Machine"" - they aren't kidding. I can practically smell the citrus from across the room.  T: ""King Julius"" meets ""Very Green"" F: Lingering finish, where the ""Very Green"" aspect (bitterness) eventually takes over from the juice. O: I liked this very much, but it wasn't quite what I expected. TH's own description of ""King Julius"" meets ""Very Green"" is apt. I'm more Team Julius than Team Green, so was expecting more of a fruit bomb. That being said, this is a very enjoyable beer, if you don't mind a bitter finish after all the juice. If you're looking for merely Julius or King Julius on steroids, you're going to be slightly disappointed."
5443,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.04,"Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA"
5444,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.75,"A: Pours a deep murky brown color with a beige colored head. Head is somewhat creamy, has very decent volume considering the aging done on this beer but dissipates quite quickly to a ring. S: This beer really needs to not be ice cold for the nose to open. Still, it's pretty faint. There are notes of leather, peacans, vanilla, pepper, oak, caramel and light smoke. Quite a bit of raisins, dates and figs and maybe even dried apricot? Very nice and coherent but pretty low on intensity.  T: What it lacks in smell intensity, it fucking gives back in taste. Jesus this beer is insane. It's insanely tasty with a ton of raisins, figs, dates and yes dried apricots. You have a ton of caramel, toffee, vanilla, smoke, very smooth oak, light pepper, super strong vanilla, leather and peacans. It's insanely complex and incredibly coherent. If I could give this beer a 6 I would. Taste wise, it has NO faults (enough for me to give a 5 on its own) and is absolutely spectacular in the mouth with its intensity of flavors while still being very drinkable."
5445,Mornin' Delight,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.8%,4.81,Bellview! Straight crazy... Nose is a decadent blend of coffee and chocolate and that mouth feel that coats the tongue and back of yer throat leaving you needing another sip!
5446,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.64,"Can dated 01/28/21 into a Spiegelau IPA glass. L: Pours hazy white yellow with 2+ fingers of pillowy white head with great retention and left mixed lacing. S: Potent citrus with some prominent floral notes, then breadiness, slight hints of dank and tropical fruit underneath.  T: Follows the nose very well, with slight additional pine dimension. Finishes with plenty of bitterness and medium acidity, acidity lingers and drys the palate.  F: Low-medium bodied with medium-high carbonation, tingles on the tongue, slick on the swallow. O: Definitely my jam, loved it!"
5447,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.5,"Very interesting and complex ale. First, this is definitely a sour. I usually do not like sours but this is definitely one I will keep drinking. The nose is a very light raspberry with a hint of yeast or fruit wine influence. It is a beautiful deep red color. The taste definitely has a fruit wine influence with a subtle bubbly or spicy finish. Overall a fantastic well made beer, especially if you enjoy raspberries."
5448,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,3.32,"Some chocolate, spices, oak and a massive sweetness that overshadowed all other components of the beer. Nice mouth feel, but not much else positive to say. Cloyingly sweet and could not finish my 6 oz pour."
5449,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.25,"Appearance: Pours double chocolate fudge colored with a one finger tan head; shards of lacing linger Smell: Roast, dark chocolate, caramel and coffee with a hint of vanilla Taste: Mocha forward, with dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee tones; caramel sweetness filters in, through the middle, while the coffee aspect lingers into the finish Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation Overall: For a sweet milk stout, this one has a lot of complex flavors and never becomes cloying"
5450,Congress Street IPA,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.44,"Classic New England IPA looks with that yellow gold color and a massive 2 finger off white head that faded slowly and left really nice spotty lacing. Trillium IPA's keep the looks at the highest standard.  Smells super dank with fresh weed, orange peel, tangerine, guava, fresh pineapple, mango, wet citrus hops, floral notes, very light peppery spices, sweet malt, caramel and gummy bears. Not the most balanced brew, but super juicy smelling. Tastes as good as it smells with everything listed in the description above plus grapefruit, lemon, Razzles candy, faint piney notes, orange juice and fresh cut grass. The same dank qualities from the nose come through with the flavor and add nice complexities."
5451,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,4.53,"Had this at Aslin's second anniversary. The look is an unmistakable pinkish purple color and the taste is quite different. If you aren't into sour type beers, you might pass. For what it is though, you will likely find no better."
5452,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.68,2017
5453,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.25,Pours a dark burgundy with slight head that fades quickly and minimal lacing. Aroma hits right away with fresh sour blackberries and red wine. The taste follows the nose. There's a bit of lemon and some red wine vinegar along with a buttery component that comes through as it warms. Mouth feel is light to medium. Very good overall. Glad I got to try this.
5454,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.99,"2016 22oz bottle from my wine cabinet,13.4% by volume. Thin ring of brown foam when poured in tulip glass."
5455,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,3.98,"Canned fall 2016; drank 9/17/16 @ the Yarchives.  Opaque orange appearance.  Huge white head; frothy lace.  Pineapple, banana & dry grapefruit notes in the nose.  Medium thick mouthfeel.  Pineapple & faint banana flavors up front; dry grapefruit notes on the finish. No booze heat.  A touch too dry for my palate, but very nice."
5456,Gueuze 100% Lambic,99,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.74,Pours a lightly hazy amber with a rose gold hint around the edges. 
5457,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,5.0,"Very rarely do I give a 5 for every category, but there just really isn't any other choice here.  The first thing you notice is the coconut floaties. Now I'm not talking about the occasional sprinkle you get with Cycle or other decent BA coconut Stouts. The chunks of coconut just come flowing out. Unreal. This beer is so thick, too. Coats the glass Smell is amazing. No one adjunct stands out above the rest. Same with the taste. Absolutely incredible.  Mouthfeel is where this truly shines. I have never had a beer where people were smacking their lips minutes after taking each sip. We all were amazed at how much this beer stuck to your mouth like syrup.  Truly one of the top 3 beers I've had, and if I'm being honest (which is hard for an Indiana local to admit) it might be better than Handjee for the top spot. Seek out as many as you can. You won't be disappointed."
5458,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.23,"Picked up a 6 pack of these before we left the source. Basically drank everything they had on draft but this, seeing as how I was gonna grab a pack on the way out. Drank the first one at Trekkie's wedding.  Pours a familiar beer color yellow-light orange with 1/3"" white head that dissolves at a predictably average rate. Aroma seemed to go with Galaxy and Citra hops? Notes of pine and pineapple were abundant alongside a mild sweet citrus component. Taste and mouth feel are where its at. Has a similar to Pliny like texture of corn syrup for drying effect and hop avalanche on top of a relatively easy going malt bill. Keeps the grapefruit, orange and pineapple feels flowing the entire time. Real easy to drink, hides alcohol especially well. The pine seems to be from the boil, the CTZ (they call 'em Columbus for some reason in the more liberal parts it seems, odd) pushes through the entire drinking experience. Definitely gonna bring one of these out to Thanksgiving and see how much it changes in a 6 week period. Excellent beer bordering on world class for me."
5459,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.56,"Gifted from @lingenbrau. I thought it lost carbonation, but he told me their stuff is normally under carbed. Either way, it's a winner. Dark muddy brown color. Smell is boozy, oaky, apply. Taste is the old ale style, malty, strong booze, sweet, smoky, woody barrel and apple notes. Smooth, mild burn, trying not to hold the lack of carb against it as I'm not sure if that was how it was intended. Very good."
5460,Moment Of Clarity,100,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.7%,2.81,"16 oz. can. Pours quite black with a mocha head. Smells of sharp coffee, maple, lactose sweetness, and roasted malt. Tastes of coffee throughout. Rich coffee, but lactose and maple make it taste acidic. I'll never understand why this is a desired flavor. Sweet maple and chocolate with a roasted malt finish. Medium heavy. Sweet, but not oppressively. Slow to drink, but it's not prohibitive. Lactose, as always, ruins it. Although without the lactose I'd probably still be complaining about how sharp and sweet it was. I made it about through about 3/4ths of the can before dumping it."
5461,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,5.0,"Simple put this beer is perfection. Rich, creamy, smooth while bursting with tropical juice goodness. The balance is perfect which is what separates the truly elite beers above the rest. Wish is was available all the time...."
5462,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.99,"This is the best beer I have ever tasted. If someone is sick of beer and is questioning if any beer is still worth drinking, give them one of these and it will immediately remind them how refreshing a beer can be."
5463,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,11%,4.05,"Very good barrel aged russian imperial stout. Doesn't meet the hype, but does not disappoint either. The body did meet the hype, with a roasty, thick, and boozy feel all the way through the glass. The taste was a bit smoky, with the bourbon and malt leading the charge with aftertastes of dark chocolate, oat and tobacco. Very enjoyable, would have again on a cold winter night"
5464,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.45,First time seeing Lawson in my local six pack shop! Great tasting hop profile smooth herbal dank yet balanced. Kind of worth the hype but to me I could probably find smoother local IPA's. Still was glad to pick one up for around 5 bucks to try!
5465,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.47,"Review #1200 Amazing Russian imperial stout - very happy to be able to get a hold of one of these. 10/16/18 date printed on bottle so this one was over 18 months old. Pours a thick rich jet-black color with just a little tan head and some spotty lingering lacing - not quite as creamy as I was expecting. Huge aromas of rich dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, nuttiness, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, oak, malt, maybe a little faint cinnamon. Taste follows the nose, great balance and richness. Very complex and excellent depth, the bourbon really hits you gently as the beer warmed. Smooth, silky, luscious mouthfeel, just the right amount of carbonation. Became a little more chewy as the beer warmed - very nice. An outstanding beer."
5466,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.29,"Smell was awesome. Nice cinnamon and maple. The initial flavor was what threw me. Almost like an apply flavor in the front, that melded into a maple bomb. Smelled great. Initial flavor not great. Back end flavor, decent. 3.6 EDIT: Tried it for a second time, and I think my first bottle was a bad one. Everything came together very nicely with all the flavors. No apple, but lots of maple and cinnamon. Great beer"
5467,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.75,"Funktastic old bottle that I split with my dad and two guys from NYC that we met at the tasting room outside of Brussels, Belgium. Beautiful atmosphere for a one of a kind sour. Definitely acquired taste but if you like the style you are in for a treat."
5468,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.56,"Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Fort Point Market, Boston, MA"
5469,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.52,"A beastly brew, at 16+ there is definitely some power to this one. It has great barrel presence, with a slug of vanilla on the mid-palate. The length is there. Maybe I'm just not as big a vanilla fan? It was good, but not something I'd need to seek out or ""overpay"" for."
5470,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.06,**
5471,No Rules,100,Porter - Imperial,15%,4.49,"A- Pours truly like motor oil with a body as dark as darkness itself and a small brown cap. The frothy foam slowly falls and lacing is sparse with some webs and sheets. S- The dark roasty grains really shine here with deep cocoa powder, pure roast barley, espresso and char notes. With warmth the barrel and coconut open up quite a bit but in the end the aroma is rather balanced. Toasty coconut, oaky vanilla, smooth bourbon, milk chocolate, slight dried dark fruits, sugar and toffee. T- This is a big boy. Honestly doesn't drink even close to 15% with the coconut and roasted grains coming out as the main flavors in the brew. Luscious toasted coconut and medium dark chocolate leads into vanilla oak bourbon, dark roast coffee, charred grain, toffee, slight dark dry fruits, toasted nuts, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla bean, fresh toasted woody oak and peppery whiskey. MF- Massive thickness to this dark oily monster. Slick and sweet syrup with a rich and frothy consistency. Ends warm but this is smooth. Coconut joins in on a huge amount of roasty grains and a flavorful bourbon barrel. Vanilla, chocolate, coffee and coconut monster."
5472,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,5.0,"Had this both fresh and ""aged"" for what it is worth, and I will say that the strength of the cinnamon itself does die down a little given time. But even with time, this is a cinnabomb, and as my favorite adjunct in a stout, take the rating with a little sense of bias. The cinnamon hides/tones down a bit of the sweetness of the overall brew, yet seems to be enhanced in flavor. A great addition to the BA DL family."
5473,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.42,"2019 bottle - black, some beige head, good lacing. Nose predominantly roasted malt and cocoa with light vanilla. Taste big, sweet, chocolate, bitter coffee. Big, silky feel and below moderate carbonation. Was going to hold it, but TSA repacked the bag poorly."
5474,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.5,"Pretty high bar to set, describing it as sharing qualities with Expedition and the feel of Double Cream. Also a beer that I've long wanted to try. But my first experience largely lived up to the high billing. Jet black body with cola-brown edges. Not as viscous or thick as I expected, but it's certainly a big and bold looking stout. Handsome mocha cap of latte head that collapses quite quickly but leaves a strong circumferential ring of chocolate foam that provides spotty lacing down the glass. Swirls of the glass produce moderate alcohol legs and renewed mocha film that compliments the jet black coloring extremely well. The aroma and taste profile is as expected, with huge bursts of dark chocolate, roasty and toasty malts, divine dark fruits, exotic woods, licorice, brown sugar, and barrel char. The nose is masterfully layered, with no single note dominating and each whiff leading with something different. On the tongue you get an added streak of whiskey heat and molasses sweetness, with strong barrel personality -- toffee, oak, and a little maple -- standing out. There's perhaps just a tad too much black licorice for my liking, but that's pretty nit-picky. It's not a sweet stout, at all, but the semi-sweetness and strong bitterness balance each other out beautifully. Feel is thinner than I expected and was hoping for (especially given the Double Cream reference), but it's incredibly smooth and silky with just a wee bit of stickiness. Reasonably carbonated and very little boozy heat."
5475,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.75,"Flora is clean, crisp, light, and tart, with smooth background tones of wine and oak. Its simple, and in it's simplicity adds meaning to all of its variants."
5476,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.5,"2018 bottle. Pours black with a large light brown head that settles to a ring and leaves minimal lacing. Smells of oak, vanilla, bourbon and dark fruits. Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, oak, caramel, figs, dates, toffee,raisin and a hint of chocolate. Full bodied. light carbonation, plush mouth feel, bourbon lingers on the finish along with mild dryness."
5477,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.33,"Pours a slightly hazy golden honey color with a big fluffy white head that left some sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma is big on floral hops, fresh. Pineapple notes, perhaps some mango. The taste is of the tropical hop flavors, pineapple and mango. I get a bit of a grassy bitterness. The malt is bready and provides some honey sweetness. The feel is of a solid malt body. Great balance between sweet and bitter. 8% ABV well hidden. Drinks easy for a bigger beer. Very nice double IPA that drinks too easy."
5478,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.74,"2016 batch drank in a snifter on 12/9/2016 Overall this was a really enjoyable beer. The vanilla was potent and opened up more as it warmed, overtaking the strawberry which was more prevalent when colder. The combo with the chocolate was very nice. The barrel was present but didn't overpower the NEOP flavors. This was really enjoyable and I'm glad to try it. One of the thicker cycle beers finally. Creamy as well. Well done!"
5479,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a burnt caramel color with a modest head that quickly fades to a ringlet; leggy, with spots of lacing on the way down Smell: Caramel, black cherry, date, fig, maple syrup, Oloroso sherry and Bourbon; hints of walnut, chocolate and vanilla Taste: Caramel, black cherry, date, fig and maple syrup, up front, Tawny Port, Oloroso Sherry and Bourbon tones developing in the mid-palate; still boozy, after the swallow, with hints of walnut and vanilla; the aftertaste is a blend of the fortified wine, the Bourbon and the fruit Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low carbonation; warmth in the gullet Overall: I have traded away quite a few bottles of this over the year and while I have tried it, on occasion, at tastings, I waited a few years before opening my last bottle; I am surprised that it remains a little hot and angular and would have hoped that it had come together more by this time; Olde Hickory has a way with barleywines and this shows off their talents"
5480,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.71,"Poured from a can (01Dec2020) into a Teku L: pours a translucent more dull yellow orange with a nice and thick white head. As it fades leaves great large rings of lacing, as does each sip ~30 minutes post pour S: get this excellent and layered tropical/grassy/vegetal aroma, slightly sweet with a bit of bitterness toward the back cutting through. Get passionfruit, peach (white peach, candy rings), melon, some citrus, papaya, slight grass, berries? T: follows the nose so well, delivers what I hoped with a bit more of an earthy flavor to complement the fruit notes. Tropical fruit leads, getting that peach and melon from the nose along with passionfruit and I want to say mango? Immediately playing against the fruit is this earthier/grassy flavor that adds excellent depth for me. Toward the finish get a slight pithy citrus bitterness, mixed with those vegetal notes. There’s something about the flavor of this beer I can’t get over, simply love it F: medium+ carbonation, medium body, call it medium drying (I want another sip but not desert inducing), very drinkable O: probably my favorite HF IPA - nose and swallow checks pretty much every box for me, mouthfeel is excellent and welcomes each sip. I can drink this again and again without hesitation"
5481,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.2,"Pours a deep amber and a reasonable head, decent lacing. Smells very fruity, orange and peach. Booze not noticeable despite the hefty ABV. Taste is dominated by fruit, mostly peach and citrus. Bitterness is moderate but only noticed after the fruit flavor. Feel: Medium mouthfeel, carbonation is just right and a pleasant aftertaste. Overall: An excellent beer. If you like fruity flavors this is an amazing beer, if you prefer a traditional grainy beer or super bitter IPA, this might not be what you are looking for, but I really enjoyed it being an occasional IPA drinker."
5482,Mocha Wednesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.9%,3.72,"2017 vintage (thanks Mike!) . Pours two shade shy of black with lovely ruby highlights when backlit. No head whatsoever on this beer. Nose reveals big ethanol notes (enough to ignite your nose hairs) followed by dark malts. Taste expresses toffee, ethanol and some peppery notes, on a dark malty backbone. Mouthfeel is quite thin with a mild carbonation. This beer is hot!. Overall impressions - young and thin. Let this one sit for a few years."
5483,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.66,22oz bottle poured into snifter. 1/21/15 Pour is a sludgy red/brown with barely even a whisper of bubbles that are gone immediately. 
5484,V.S.O.J.,100,Barleywine - English,14%,4.6,"12 oz can poured into a tulip. Appearance was a little off putting as this was very dark brown. Not the color I'm used to from a typical barley wine. Small off-white head that dissipated quick. Aroma was off the charts....lots of barrel character such as bourbon and wood. Dark fruit was heavily present. Lots of fig, raisin and prune and a hint of tobacco. Flavor was everything I detected in the aroma. Tons of fig, raisin and prune...lots of bourbon and oak. Very rich. Feel was medium bodied. Kinda stout like which is thicker for a barley wine. Overall, this was fantastic. A real treat to have. Glad to have been able to try."
5485,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.29,"A- 375ml bottle pours into a tulip glass with a motor oil black body. The foam that forms on the beer is a light brown and has a puffy texture. The head rises to a finger high and has decent retention. Not a ton of lacing but a few small webs and some spottiness. S- Woah, didn't expect the walnuts to make a massive difference but the first thing I smell upon pouring the bottle, from a few feet away, is toasted walnuts. The nuts combine with the roasted malts, which are chocolately and fudgey, as well as some caramel notes to remind me of turtles or a nutty, caramel chocolate treat. Bourbon barrel comes next with some vanilla sweets, slight wood and hints of whiskey. Strong cocoa as well as hints of earthy cinnamon. Not picking up on the peppers here. T- Not quite as nutty as the aroma but the walnuts are still present throughout and one of the main flavors along with the cocoa and the barrel which gains considerable strength on the palate. A bit of habanero heat in the finish but no obvious pepper flavor, which is probably a good thing if we are being honest. Vanilla beans are strong with caramel, milk chocolate, roast barley, spicy Bourbon, medium toast oak and spicy cinnamon notes. MF- Medium bodied and a little bit thinner than I expected after smelling and tasting this one. I guess it just lacks creaminess and is lightly frothy instead. Fairly slick and oily but not syrupy. The carbonation is moderate and it finishes with moderate alcohol warming and some heat from the peppers. Reminds me of a walnut, caramel and chocolate cluster and I am impressed by how much the walnuts are expressed in the final brew. The flavor is where things really balance out nicely but the body could be just a bit creamier if I am being honest."
5486,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,4.68,Appearance - Drink it from the can! The can looks cool! Smell - The nose previewed the dankness to come.  Taste - The profile began with lemon before bitter grass established itself. It was dank. Mosaic hops were prominent than Citra hops. The bitterness lingered nicely.  Mouthfeel - The full body allowed the bitterness to linger. Carbonation was very active.  Overall - Review #1500 was great.
5487,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.87,"From a growler. Fresh fresh fresh! Hop aromas are pretty floral and fruit-forward. Plenty of biscuity grain detectable. Flavor is juicy citrus and melon fruits and some dank rosewater. Grassy on the back end, seems like a hallmark of Alpine. Mouthfeel is smooth with a distinctive tongue tickle. Way too drinkable for how strong it is. Right up there next to Enjoy By and Dinner."
5488,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.71,2014 Vintage
5489,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,5.0,Poured from a growler I got about a week ago. Great head. I really don’t pick up a lot of smell at all? Sad! Tastes unbelievable though and goes down so easy you’d never guess it has a 10+ ABV Had again a few years later out of can. Hard to find anything wrong here!
5490,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,4.41,"The monk on the bottle makes it a 5 for look. Split a 750ml with some friends who don't typically like beer, and they loved this! I guess that tells you all you need to know..."
5491,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.67,"12oz bottle Pours less than a finger of white head into my snifter. Retention is average, but leaves behind nice initial lacing. Body looks like OJ. Looks pretty good so far, for a hazy. Nose has some punch to it, that’s for sure. A load of dankness hits you right in the mouth. Juicy as well, grapefruit, mango, pretty standard. Maybe a touch of guava. Somewhat sweet. I mean it smells good, but I’ve done this song and dance before, nothing new. Flavor is interesting, definitely not as pungent with dank hops as the nose. Has a pretty moderate start, small dank hop presence, mixed with some light mango notes, substantial grapefruit, finishes smooth and creamy. It tastes fine, just a little off, almost like I’m drinking grapefruit juice, it has a puckering quality to it. The mouthfeel is part of the problem, while it is smooth and creamy, it’s too much so. Carbonation is too low, which I guess is “normal” at this point, but unwelcome. It’s like grapefruit flavored milk, it doesn’t work for me feel wise at all. Drinkability is ok, but it is pretty damn tart, not bitter, tart. The appearance turned out really nice, lacing was thick from top to bottom. Overall this is a good beer, but these small details really hurt it, like carbonate your beer for the love of god."
5492,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.49,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of maple syrup, baker’s chocolate, molasses, caramel, and bourbon. It tastes of baker’s chcolate, maple syrup, molasses, caramel, with some bourbon heat. The feel is thick, but smooth on the back end. A good barrel aged stout from Hill Farmstead, pretty light on the maple."
5493,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.5,"4.5 across the board. Pours a hazy light yellow with minimal head. Nose is slightly tropical with citrus and floral mingling in. Taste of fresh cut pinnaple, orange juice and light grapefruit pith. A bite dank with notes of floral a subtle hints of pale malts. Medium body with a slight bitter dry finish."
5494,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.51,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing. This smells like coconut truffles, coconut cream, bourbon spice, roast, burnt brown sugar, caramel, maple, oak, and milk chocolate. This is definitely huge and sweet, and I wish there was more barrel to it. But it's undeniably delicious, and the coconut is so delicious here. I want more oak, but the bourbon definitely seems to bring across a burnt sugar/maple/caramel type flavor, without much booziness. The base stouts are super fudgy and milk chocolate-y. This is very thick bodied, chewy, and fudgy feeling, with no real booziness to it. This is absolute absurd decadence and delicious. But I do think Anchorage overall does barleywines better."
5495,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.44,"02/2015 - 2013 vintage - Wow, this is exactly what I wanted from this Black Tuesday variant; the chocolate takes it to the next level - big fan! The mouthfeel is even better, too."
5496,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.77,Pours jet black with a thick light brown head. 
5497,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.1,This pours a darker tan caramel color. I get a sweetish citrus aroma that's matched by the taste from each sip. Sweet sticky citrusy and smooth. Hides its abv well.
5498,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.47,"L - 1/2 finger dense mocha head atop a motor oil body. S - bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, molasses, coffee, a hint of nuttiness, just a whiff of booze. T - tons of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and coffee. Some barrel booze, wood, char, roast, molasses. Finishes with some smokiness. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Moderate-low booziness. F - medium body and carb. O - wonderful flavors. If the body was a little heftier this would be a world beater."
5499,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.16,"2019 Vintage (13% ABV) - Gold wax-dipped bottle - Poured into a stemless snifter at 48°F. Pours a thick, oily tar-black, barely forming a dark brown collar before fizzing out, sitting absolutely still and oily in the glass. Coats the glass in a sticky brown sheen. Nose: Dark roasted malts lend plenty of cocoa, as well as molasses, brown sugar, caramel, and toffee. Plenty of barrel presence, with charred oak, spicy rye whiskey, and a lot of woody vanillin. Definitely some pepper heat, and just a touch of savoury, almost smoky chilies, with a hint of cacao nib, and just a dusting of a dusting of cinnamon. Really does bring a Mexican hot cocoa vibe. Palate: This one's a bit of a sleeper on the nose. Barrel-Aged Abraxas greets the palate with brown sugar, caramel, semi-sweet chocolate, and chocolate fudge, with a nice prominent whiskey barrel presence threading all the way through. A vanilla bean intensity builds quickly, making you double-check the label to see if there's vanilla here. Sweetness is there, but is surprisingly tame for what this is. A slight cacao nib bitterness unfurls, and just a touch of chili heat, gently warming the tongue, and sending a peppery bite down the throat. Some darker, roastier notes appear, quickly drying out the malt sweetness with a bit of charred malt. The finish brings dark chocolate, burned sugar, a kiss of chili sharpness, and just a minute whisper of blink-and-you'll-miss-it cinnamon, ultimately concluding with lingering roast and dry oak. Mouthfeel/Body: There's a rich fullness to this, but more in a creamy lactose way. It's actually not terribly fudgy or at all syrupy, and goes down fairly easily - perhaps even a little thin, despite its size. Little effervescence - just some soft underlying fizz. Only a touch of stickiness around the lips. Dries out very well in the finish, and just some mild warmth going down. Again, very balanced. Overall: One cannot help but have some lofty expectations when opening a beer such as this. For all intents and purposes, it's a fine barrel-aged stout, with a nice whiskey presence and a pleasingly balanced chili influence. The lack of cinnamon hurts this one, as does the thinner body and swift roasty finish. Perhaps other vintages convey the Mexican cake theme a bit better, but at the end of the day, this isn't a top 3/250 beer for me. Nevertheless, a quality stout."
5500,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.41,"Enjoying a 2013 vintage obtained in trade, which is apparently not recommended, but I still find it one of the best porters I've ever had. No signs of significant oxidation, and the floral hop character is extremely delicate, surrounded by dark chocolate, earthy cold-brew coffee, and oats. Moderately full body and luscious, silky mouthfeel. Perfect degree of carbonation and a light, medium-dry finish."
5501,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.21,"Pours a pitch black with minimal head. Hint of vanilla on the nose. Not as aromatic as when you taste it. It's a syrupy sweet coffee. It's like dark chocolate syrup with a touch of coffee. Not overly complex. Not boozy, but it feels very heavy. That might be a result of the low carbonation. It is very sweet. Overall, it might be one of Trillium's best stouts."
5502,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.5,"2014 vintage drank on 3/17/2017 Look - looks like a golden ipa with a bigger white head, nice body Smell - lemon, other citrus, some grapefruit, some funk Taste - lemon, grapefruit, barnyard funk, a little oak, nice acid Feel - creamy in some sense, nice tartness but still subtle Overall - very enjoyable, semi-complex, glad to finally have tried"
5503,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.59,"3F Hanjee gets all the hype, but Chemtrailmix is right up there, if not better depending on the year. I've had 2018 and 2019 and they're both solid beers!"
5504,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.4,**
5505,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.87,"2019 edition. Dark, boozy, with wonderful smells and tastes of bourbon, cinnamon, and chocolate - more than coffee. Very warming as it goes down. Easy to see why this is one of the best."
5506,§ucaba,100,Barleywine - English,12.5%,4.57,"*§ucaba 2019 Batch No. 008* *Poured into a Teku glass from a 12oz bottle* *Drank on: 05/18/20* Looked a brown-amber and it was pretty clear when put up against the light, pretty predictable look for a barleywine style. Had a brown colored half-finger thick head but had little to no retention to it, but considering the age and ABV, it was pretty understandable. The aroma was very barrel forward, you can definitely get a big hit of bourbon, ethanol, and oaky notes upfront. There were soft notes of leather, dark fruits, burnt caramel, vanilla, and toffee in the middle and back-end, but the beer was so barrel forward that these aromas were a bit subdued. Maybe some age will mellow out the bourbon and alcohol aromas and let the other notes shine. In terms of the flavor profiles, I felt like the taste followed the nose for the most part. Delicious and complex, I also found that this beer struck a nice balance between the sweet/caramel notes of the malt and the boozy/earthiness of the bourbon oak barrel. You get the bourbon and the oakiness upfront, which eventually just dissipates to a bourbon flavor and dark cherries in the middle. Towards the end, I got a bit of the burnt caramel, toffee, and vanilla characters which left a combination of a sweet and bitter aftertaste, though the bitterness wasn't strong at all. This beer was medium to full bodied with light carbonation. Again, this had a sweet and bitter aftertaste which lingered for a while, but the flavors weren't super bold or strong. I felt like this was a very sold representation of a barrel-aged English Barleywine style. Big malty characters of caramel and toffee, but the flavors were balanced with the booziness and earthiness of the bourbon and oak. Very solid, and will review again after a year!"
5507,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.6,"Look: very dark brown, nearly opaque. Some cola highlights when held to light. Nice frothy mocha head."
5508,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.49,"Bomber poured into snifter  Jet black liquid , one finger brown foam cap quickly recedes  Aroma of a mounds bar , chocolate , coconut , bourbon  Sweet , coffee, coconut, chocolate , bourbon taste  Velvety smooth, low sudsing, sweet coffee taste lingers"
5509,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.5,"Season 16|17 Blend No. 51 - drank November 2nd, 2019 while cleaning out a few bottles of lambic. What truly stands out to me about this blend is that it's quite absent the typical apples that define many geuzes - the tart and sour notes are far more present, and the beer doesn't have quite the same body. Lots of oak notes dominate as well. It's funky, but only lightly so. Quite a terrific beer. I'm not sure that I'd rate it significantly superior to Drie Fonteinen's standard Oude Geuze though (that being said, I absolutely adore the standard geuze... it amazes me that it's a shelfie in certain parts of the country)."
5510,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.74,"10/2016 - Amazing coconut, light rum, graham cracker, marshmallow nose; a ton of vanilla, creamy, light coconut too on the palate; incredible mouthfeel, semi-sweet finish; creamy, coconut, vanilla, rum goodness."
5511,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.28,"Bottle from Toby at de Garde anniversary event. Ruby colored pour, light pink head. Sweet, funky aroma. Grape-y taste, yeasty funk, medium tart. Hits all the right marks."
5512,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.29,"Great brew, very tasty and loaded with a good variety of hops. Rare, which is why I was so grateful to acquire two 4packs. Not the best beer I have ever had - Personally I think focal banger is better. Focal Banger is in my top 5. Would buy focal banger again would not buy heady topper again."
5513,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.17,"Nice looking beer with a nearly opaque color and a nice foamy tan head that lingered. Whiskey, coffee, cocoa, and caramel on the nose. The taste was a bit too much whiskey for me, but there was a nice sweetness and roastiness from the honey to balance things out. Not overly cloying, but essentially two dominant aspects (whiskey and honey) that battle it out. Definitely not subtle."
5514,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.42,"The Raul man has never aced anything before - schoolwork, driving test, my first time in the sack with my baby mama... All palatable, but no ace of spades for the Raul man. But consarnit, if Raul was meant to “ace” something, it would be with his palate by drinking a 100 rated beer. And right here in Swish, we have exactly that. No, this is not Swaggy P shimmy shuffling and then bricking a 3; this is Kobe down the lane dunking over Yao Ming. Believe dat! I’m out."
5515,Beyond Good And Evil,100,Stout - American Imperial,10%,4.29,"This is a review of the 2015 version that was on tap in October 2019 @ Hill Farmstead.  Pours black, 1/3"" brown head. Aroma reveals that both the coffee and maple have melded/faded into the bourbon notes. I like that sweet spot where things gel more than being led by one dominant aspect generally. Equal parts. Taste, oh shit, now we're about to get heavenly up in here. This is why sometimes you ignore that ""drink fresh"" notion. Fresh maple dominates seeming too sweet sometimes, fresh coffee just dominates and that is largely all you taste. But here, 4 years later, you get this full fledged bourbon accentuated with maple and coffee. Again, the notion of equal parts, but it tastes even better than it smells. Of course the damn mouth feel is silky and luxurious, the maple seems to be best here, smoothing out double digit abv into a delight to drink, never oppressive, hot, bitter etc. . .  Shit man, this beer is a prime example of how a barrel aged stout w some adjuncts can get even better with age."
5516,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.5,"Beautiful pour of milky orange, medium head and lots of lacing. Nose is grapefruit juice, a bit of resin. Flavor has the hop resin more forward, with herbal notes over a powerful pith core. The finish is surprisingly mild, given the grapefruit emphasis. Tasty and beautiful."
5517,Fyodor,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.1%,4.31,"Pours black with a finger of thin, large khaki bubbles. Aroma is toffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, and roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon adds a kiss of heat to the back, which is soothed out by oak. Flavor profile is really well developed, hitting notes of roasty, toasty and caramely malts with sugary notes of caramel, toffee, molasses and brown sugar. Bourbon is present, but not out of place, adding a subtle twinge of heat that works to establish a better balance. Oak and char add a little smooth bitterness at the finish. Mouth feel is still with very little nuance to the texture. It has a full and thick consistency. Overall, stout is solid with subtle and well maintained levels of flavor, heat and bourbon.  Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 500mL bottle."
5518,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,3.56,"This one pours a very dead looking and murky purplish brown, with no head and no lacing. This smells very much like apple brandy, with boozy fruit, caramel, and more booze. This is absolutely hindered by the complete and total lack of carbonation- I guess I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate something like that. It's got some interesting flavors- like smoke, prunes, chocolate, tobacco and tons of apple brandy. It's super flabby however, and just feels unfinished- I can't get fully behind it. It feels so thin and flat. The mouthfeel is obviously a weak point here- even just a little bit of carbonation would be so helpful. This is very intriguing but I just simply didn't enjoy it."
5519,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.81,Bottled 2018 (couldn't find date)
5520,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.29,"Looking at this impenetrable haze of murky yellow-peach colored concoction isn’t pretty, but the billowing white foam and lacing portends exceptional craftsmanship. One smell, and the pungent aroma of grapefruit, orange, mango, and pineapple confirms exquisite quality. Great tasting, but a bit boring. Should be on an index card for the absolute standard in easy drinking, hazy pale ales. Flavors of orange and grapefruit and mango burst through. Bitter without being too bitter, a tinge of grassy earthiness without being too floral, everything is in balance and in moderation. Velvety smooth, light mouthfeel with good carbonation."
5521,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.5,"Headroom has been a wishlist beer for a couple of years now - as with other Trillium offerings, I've only sporadically been able to nail down trades. We're only talking about IPAs here - but they can still be confoundingly difficult to locate. Headroom, strangely, fell in to my lap via a friend. This 2018 release can was a very pleasant surprise. The beer pours a light orange - the nose is soft and fruity and very pleasant. Mouthfeel is rich - in a blind test, I might very easily misidentify this beer as a milkshake IPA. It's surprisingly, really - it's just super thick and yeasty and malty. It's also tremendously sweet and soft, which I think may be the unfortunate source of the slight lingering and unpleasant aftertaste. It could definitely use a bit of a cleaner finish. I'd also have to add that it's just a bit boozy - the ABV isn't really discernible per se, but it's certainly a little hotter than your standard 8% IPA. I like, and do not like, this about the beer. I'd really like it to be a little more sessionable. But, that's my personal bias, and I haven't factored that in to my ratings. Headroom is a fantastic beer - I'll admit that I'd prefer a lot more DDH Fort Point in my life, but lacking the option, I'd very definitely take some Headroom!"
5522,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.31,"Finally got to try this whale. It was very good, however the hype around this beer killed it. I have tried many IPA'S that I consider better than Pliny the Younger. I would never again pay the premium for this beer. One and done."
5523,Mexican Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.31,"Appearance - The poured a murky black color with a dark tan head.  Smell - The nose was rich sweet chocolate. It may have been a chocolate maple combination.  Taste - Chocolate really stood out in the initial taste. It brought to mind chocolate cola. There were also notes of coffee, maple, and a touch of cinnamon. I knew this was not Mexican Cake, but I expected more heat from the chilies. The rest of the profile was well balanced.  Mouthfeel - The feel was slick with sweetness and modest carbonation.  Overall - I thought the beer was tasty, but I expected a bit more. Mainly, it lacked spice."
5524,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.46,"Pours a completely hazy, opaque, and thicc. Bright orange color. Thick, frothy white head.  Aroma has luscious, bright tropical notes. Mango, pineapple, orange, and tropical fruit interspersed with notes of dank fruit, grass and some doughy malt notes.  Taste follows the nose with notes of mango, pineapple, orange, and tropical fruit - ripe and rindy. Doughy malts provide the backbone for the hops. Light grassy and windy bitterness on the back end.  Feel is on the thick side, full bodied. Smooth, pillowy almost creamy mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation.  Overall this is a really nice NEIPA - great aroma and flavors."
5525,Lou Pepe - Framboise,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.64,"The beer pours a ruby red with a big fluffy pink head. It has medium high carbonation. The beer smells of raspberries, funk, almonds, and vanilla. It tastes lightly tart, with raspberries, almonds, vanilla, and light funk. The feel is very light and dry. A tasty lambic from Cantillon."
5526,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.69,"Pours a dark amber black. Minimal foam. Incredible aroma, cherry and campfire smoke go together. Incredibly smooth with a long finish. This beer was made to be sipped."

5528,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.55,"Had on tap at Dark Lord Day 18. Pours thick black with a halo of brown bubbles. Nose is dark chocolate, cinnamon and spice. Taste is very sweet at first, and then balanced out by the spice and of the rye barrel working very well with the cinnamon and pepper. Feel is smooth with a very nice mouthcoat that keeps the flavors lingering. Great beer. The rye barrel with the spices really worked well for this."
5529,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,3.83,"Did a side-by-side tasting with DDG, Allagash Coolship Resurgam and Jester King Spon Methode Gueze as part of our annual Xmas eve tasting."
5530,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.57,"12oz bottle poured into Chimay Goblet. 2018 vintage. L - Deep gold brown pour, thin tan head. S - Raisin bread, slight metallic note, molasses, burnt sweetness. T - Candy sweet, black licorice, treacle, almost sherry-like flavors, thinning to brown bread, and bitter grains. F - Fine carbonation, dry finish. Definitely a sipper. Would make a great dessert beer. Do not drink on an empty stomach."
5531,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.69,"Look: black with brown edges. Basically no head Smell: chocolate, malt bourbon Taste: follows the nose, the bourbon opens up more and there is a nice depth to the malt Feel: super smooth, nice gentle carbonation I have kept the bottle a 2020 for about a year before drinking it."

Aroma is rich and substantial booze, roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa, toffee. Bold and rich flavors. Booze heat but not overpowering, fudge and bitter chocolate, earthy vanilla and woody barrel. Dark fruits and licorice root. Toffee sweetness as it warms. Rich and decadent body, lighter side of moderate carbonation. Excellent brew, super mouthfeel and flavor balance/blend."

5536,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.78,"Pours a super hazy dark yellow/orange. Very nice head and good lacing. The aroma is explosive with floral, juicy orange, peach, and mango, and a nice dank edge. Some sweet, slightly toasty malt makes for the perfect backdrop. The flavor is intense and resinous. The same orange, peach, and mango flavors found in the aroma are here in big fashion. The malt adds a nice honey like sweetness and a creamy, lush body to provide the perfect backdrop for the hop flavors. Overall, an absolutely delicious hop bomb. Not a hint of anything vegetal, nothing but super intense, sticky hop flavors perfectly balanced against a creamy malt body. Perfection."

5538,Leaner,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.7,"Had side by side Casey's Leaner. Side Project's had a bit more funk and layers to it, but I preferred Casey's powerful fruit notes. Both were fantastic!"
5539,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.43,"Appearance: Beautiful dark blackberry juice. Medium size head due to the high carbonation (starting in the bottle once I cracked the cap). I was afraid I was in for a ""gusher"" but it held off. Smell: Wow, blackberries to the max. Jammy along with a strong acidity right from the nose. I could smell this brew for hours. Taste: SOUR! Before the blackberries could hit I was struck by a huge sourness that got you right in the jaw like a Sour Patch Kid. While I do love sours, this was a but much right off the bat. As the brew warmed the sourness subsided (or maybe I was just getting use to it). Aside from the sourness you get, you guessed it, tons of jammy blackberries. As it warmed I got a slightly buttery and briny flavor as I sipped. Interesting and I liked it.  Mouthfeel: This was dry, but not intensely dry. It had a nice body and as noted it was well carbonated.  Overall this was my first experience with something from Side Project and I was very pleased. If you like fruited sours (and I'm talking intense sours) then I highly recommend."

5542,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.55,"Batch 4. Appearance is light gold with good carb. Great smell with some funk that has a bit of a gueuze-like character. Taste is tart, citrusy, and incredibly balanced. Get a little bit of wheat and a little bit of oak. Overall a fantastic saison that is head and shoulders above others I've had from Hill Farmstead."
5543,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.5,"This is an amazingly balanced triple. You don’t even know you are getting mule kicked. Had it in Waitsfield, and took a 4 pack home and had it a couple weeks later. I love the Double better, but this is pretty special too"
5544,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.52,Hop Juju pours a gorgeous amber gold color with a thick creamy head. It has some serious carbonation. The aroma is equally fine. A great blend of hops and malt. The taste supports that great blend I smell. Supreme. It has enough hop bitterness to really accentuate this Imperial IPA. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick and chewy. The hops separate this from other similar beers. Overall an outstanding brew I believe I could get used to having around. Love the subtle differences in this beer.
5545,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.32,"Beautiful looking beer, pungent aromas of fuzzy peach skin, under-ripe white peach flesh, lemony acidity, and a hint of peach rings and oak. the nose on this is really wonderful. wish I could say the same about the taste - I feel like this could be used as an effective cleaning product. there is definitely a robust and complex peach flavor that is very impressive, but the overwhelming dryness and acidity detracts from that and probably drowns out some of the more subtle complexity. getting some grainy character and hints of vinegar, white grape and vanilla. don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this beer, but it was sour and acidic to the point of almost being harsh ... I tend to prefer more subtle and delicate examples of the style. As I finished the bottle I thought well this was good but I would have been fine with 8oz, which is something I have never said after drinking a 375mL of world class fruited mixed ferm."

5547,Black Note Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.2%,4.79,Phenomenal. Near perfect Drinkability and finish. This beer is smooth and perfectly balanced. You will not get a traditional place punchbof hops like most imperial stouts and that is not a bad thing.
5548,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.66,"12.7 oz, 2019 bottling, served in a snifter.  Appearance: Completely black. thin tan head with some persistent small strands and islands of lacing.  Smell: Rich and sweet - chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, just a hint of walnut.  Taste: Chocolate, vanilla (a bit fudgy), definite spiciness of cinnamon and chile powder, with bourbon mixed over it all. Finish is chocolate (light bittersweet chocolate) with definite hits of the spices at the finish. A very rich and delightful beer.  Mouthfeel: Perfectly smooth and creamy. Very light carbonation. Strongly warming at the finish due to the spices and bourbon, more due to the spices in my opinion.  Overall / Drinkability: Wow - this is quite an amazing slow sipping beer. Dangerously drinkable with sharp spice warming hits with each sip. I definitely need to pick this up again and pair it with a dessert."
5549,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.54,8/17 pour at greenway. L strong haze on pale yellow side
5550,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.0,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/15/17 with ""EW-WAM-AM-AH"" written below that. I don't know what that means or if that is a heavy metal reference but I can honesty say that this was a typical Trillium beer that had all of their attributes present in it, including an easy sense of enjoyment to it throughout my session! Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a muted honey with enough off to offset the the cloudy, dull liquid even though that settled relatively quickly. Only a few spots of lacing was left behind as I worked my way through this as the residue on the side of my pint glass was quite disappointing. Tons of mango, citrus rind, booze, and yeast filled the nose although they were quite muted from the first whiff onward. Dank, pithy, and strong, tons of melon, cantaloupe, and kiwi came through as this warmed up but it was never easygoing enough for me to fully embrace. This had a creaminess and slickness to it that saved it from being a disappointment but it needed more sugar and tangerine from feeling too heavy, as the carbonation was nearly nowhere to be found... No doubt that this had enough alcohol to it and it seemed to complement the subtle hop burn quite well. That wasn't what I was looking for as this beer put the ""heavy"" into heavy mettle. Tons of Galaxy hops ensured that this would be a dank hop bomb but in the end, this needed it's rough edges rounded out a bit. Worth a go for those who love Trillium but this didn't match up with their better, and more popular offerings..."
5551,Chemtrailmix,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.95,"Had on tap at DLD. At a glance this looks like most other DL with a dark chocolate brown with a small head. The smell is dark chocolate and cinnamon toast crunch. When you take a sip the, the cinnamon plays perfectly with the dark chocolate and cocoa aspects of the Dark Lord. There is a slight heat and spice on the backend that lingers. Overall, this is one of the best variants of Dark Lord I've had in awhile and get why people hope to get this bottle!"
5552,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.67,"Canned 1/12/21, in DC. L: Pours a hazy orange-yellow. Thin head, which stays. Splotchy lacing. S: Citrus, but with just a bit of a medicinal tint, which turns out to be a harbinger. T: Astringent. More medicinal than citrus. Dry and slightly bitter finish. Very little fruity, floral, or hoppy in the flavor profile. F: Medium mouthfeel. Appropriately carbonated. Doesn't burn, despite the astringency. O: Disappointing for Other Half. It looks, smells, and feels good, but the taste is lacking. Hoping this is just the DC brewers finding their footing."
5553,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.74,"Thanks to my new friends at the Cycle Barrel Aged Day bottle shared. Look- A smooth black with a thin tannish head which faded quickly.  Smell- A mix of barrel, booze, and sweetness of chocolate. Interesting mix that really works. Taste- Chocolate, barrel, coconut, and just a hint of cinnamon. Nothing like the Hunahpus that I had tried before. There was more sweetness but the barrel gave it a nice sharp flavor. I think the brandy really gave the flavors an awesome boost.  Mouthfeel- A nice thick coating which lingers. Full bodied and little carbonation. Overall- A fantastic brew from Cigar City. This is definitely a one of a kind brew."
5554,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.49,"L: A dark ruby red with very little head and no lacing. Slight alcohol legs. S: Fruity, deep, rich caramel, raisin, prune, vanilla, coconut, and cognac. T: Very rich caramel flavor, similar to aroma, raisin, vanilla, coconut. F: Thick, full bodied, very smooth and creamy finish. Overall: One hell of a strong beer, but very smooth considering. It drinks like it has lower abv, very little alcohol burn, although five years in the bottle certainly helped. Highly reccomended."

5556,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.0,"Maybe it was an off can or I was just not in the right mood, but my first exposure to this last week (from Tavour) was very meh, especially compared to the other TG offerings I've had. Fortunately I have a couple more cans and will try again soon. Bitterness was really the only thing that stood out to me."
5557,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.75,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with thin white head. Aroma of coffee,molasses and cocoa. Thick, sweet and sticky on the mouth. Coffee, cocoa, brown sugar, molasses, caramel flavors. Awesome stout."
5558,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.25,"Finally had a chance to try this iconic beer. As is the nature of things this beer is a huge credit to history and the early expansion of huge bitter west coast style DIPAs. Somewhat reminiscent of a Pliny, etc. Clearly remains an outstanding beer but now the bitterness and dank quality seem overstated. The creamy deep maltiness has a slight bit of a cloying and syrup. 10 years ago I would have marveled... now it seems somewhat pushy even a bit harsh in the aftertaste."
5559,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.46,"Poured from the 500 mL into a snifter. Fizzy pale white head (it gushed when I popped it) over a peach skin color. Some residue but beautiful. 4.75 Tart orchard fruit and earthiness. Some sort of unripe peach or apricot. The fruit is robust. 4.25 Apricot or peach, I don't know but it's either of these fruits tasting like an unripened puree, earthiness, Brett-y yeast flavor. Gets oaky and a touch of white wine. Plenty of flavor here. 4.5 Vinous and tart and dry but so easy-drinking. Delicious. 4.5 Love this fruit exposition. Great brew."
5560,Barrel Aged Bomb!,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.7%,4.68,"Smell: Initially I get a good amount of spicy green chillies. a lot of chocolate. Dark Chocolate, milk chocolate. You get some Barrel notes, Sweet vanilla, toasted coconut, smooth whiskey with a hint of oak. Also get some caramel and dark malts that come through as well.  Taste: This is a lot sweeter and Maltier on the palate. Right upfront I get massive amount of butterscotch, carmel, and chocolate syrup. The sweetness from the chocolate and malt carry through the beer. In the mid palate you get milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, dark chocolate, and smooth medium roast coffee, almost like a cold brewed coffee in the way that it's not very roasty and it is extremely smooth. The beer finishes with a hint of green pepper spice, whiskey, toasted coconut, a kiss of oak and more of that Hershey chocolate syrup. As I mentioned the beer is sweeter on the plate which is really nice. The malty butterscotch sweetness lingers on in the after taste as you feel a nice lingering warmth in your chest. The beer also has a ton of chocolate which is awesome. Feel: Medium bodied. A really nice creaminess, a perfect amount of carbonation, which helps the beer feel a little fuller, which is a good thing because the beer is on the thinner side for a Barrel Aged Stout. Still the carbonation and creaminess makes the beer just glide across your palete, which in turn makes this way easier drinking then it should be. Overall: An awesome beer that really held up great to the Barrel aging process. The Barrel adds a big sweetness and nice boozy presence. In the end though This is only slightly better then the none Barrel Aged version, I would say there almost equal, which is ok because both the BA and non BA version are top notch world class offerings. Don't worry if you can't get your hands on the BA version, because the regular will do just fine."

Picking up pineapple, orange, grapefruit, mango and others.  Taste follows. Juicy with above mentioned aromas as well as a bitter hoppiness.  Soft mouth feel. Bit of noticeable carbonation. Mildly bitter aftertaste.  Even with 4 months on this beer, it drinks great. Solid beer."
5571,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.38,"Was surprised that I got to try this beer. Batch 1, shared at the SP Brewery 1 year anniversary. Pours a dark reddish hue, with not a ton of carb. I didn't pick up on much more than the cherry on the nose. Flavor was pretty intense, which was a bit of a surprise given the age of the bottle. A nice robust tart cherry flavor on the palate. I didn't get a lot of the barrel, but that could've been from all the other insane beers I was having at the time."
5572,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.35,"On tap at Kuni Sama A: Pours dark brown, nearly black with a khaki head that settles to a thin layer and leaves a little spotty lacing. S: Traditional FW barrel nose to start, lots of dark sugar, toffee, smooth bourbon, a little vanilla, roasted malt, a touch of coffee, and faint dark fruit. T: Balanced, peppery spice, roasted malt, dark chocolate, smooth bourbon, dark sugar, vanilla, oak, coffee is somewhat subtle, but adds another nice dimension.  M: Full body, moderate carbonation, just a touch of warmth. O: I've had some barrel aged coffee imperial stout where the coffee ran the show. This is quite different. It more just adds another layer to an already great beer. I think they could have added in a bit more, though the bitterness could always throw off the balance."

5575,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.62,"Pours a cloudy, attractive gold color with a 2 finger, dense bright white head. Great looking. The aroma is light and fresh with notes of grapefruit and tangerine, though not too sweet. The flavor follow the smell with well-balanced, light and fresh citrus and tangerine flavors with a hint of florals brought on by a semi-sweet light malt base. The finish is clean with orange notes. Feel is soft with a light effervescence and very low bitterness.  This is just a fantastic, unpretentious beer that is masterfully crafted with balance in mind. It should be an award winner IMO."
5576,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.54,"Can dated 4/14/21 into pint glass. Pours a very hazy golden orange with a nice off-white head. Good lacing. Initial impression is pineapple, mango, a bit of grassiness, pine resin, and a very subtle sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium and chewy; carbonation is perfect. Finish is more citrus and pine, fading to a slight but enjoyable bitterness. Overall, one of Other Half's better offerings IMHO."
5577,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.56,"Dark cola brown in the glass with bits of light coming through the edges. No head lingers in the glass but there was lovely carbonation at first. Barrel and coffee comes through in the most but the barrel is not super pronounced. Roast, slight chocolate and vanilla and booze is there but well balanced and dare I say hidden. Taste is somewhat sweet with a roasty middle and followed by a woodsy back end with the slightest bourbon bite. Feel is kind of thin especially for the style. It has slightly more carbonation than is usual for the style but barely any objectively speaking. Overall a great beer that is very well balanced but could use some more body. Not a coffee bomb at all."
5578,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,4.6,"Definitely coffee up front, dark chocolate malt, dark fruit, medium mouthfeel, a light lingering bitterness. A wonderful stout that sets the standard."
5579,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.31,"This had a good bit of barrel sweetness. Bit of coffee, but more roast. It did also have this honey-type of sweetness at the end I don’t usually taste in the style. Not bad, but unexpected. Medium feel."
5580,Sunday Brunch,100,Porter - Imperial,9.2%,4.4,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Blue Session. Aroma has fresh roasted coffee beans, toasted malt and espresso notes. Taste has bittersweet coffee, cold brew and a fresh, roasty bitterness on the finish."
5581,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.59,"Pouring this from a 22 oz. bottle into a snulip glass, this beer pours out as black as night and forms a pinky worth of tightly packed, peanut butter fudge colored bubbles to rest on top as a crown. 4.25 The nose brings a plethora of different layers; creamy coffee, semi sweet chocolate, maple sweetness, burnt brown sugar and slightly toasted coconut on the backend, all resting on top of a smokey/salty base. The barrel is detectable through some very slight dry oak notes. 4.5 The taste comes in with sweet maple before melding into slightly roasty, creamy coffee notes. The smokey/salty layers are still present, tangling with brown sugar and semisweet chocolate. It makes me think of coating maple bacon strips with brown sugar, putting them in the oven, and then pulling them out and drizzling them with chocolate, all while you are enjoying your morning coffee. The barrel is very slightly present, offering just a touch of dry oak and a kiss of dark fruit at the very end. If you weren’t searching for it, you might not even guess it was there. 4.75 The mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. The carbonation is low-low medium, allowing the drink to shine. It’s very smooth and drinkable, hardly any warmth from the bourbon barrels. It does offer a touch of dry oak, but almost none of the 13% ABV is showing through. It’s dangerous. 4.5 Overall, I’d say the balance and plethora of layers and the way they mix are the winners here. Nothing is trying to take away from the other, just all tangling perfectly to create an amazing drinking experience. 4.5"
5582,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.32,"Thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can of this. Something I remember trying to get when it first came out but those Connecticut haze boys value this thing on whale tier level. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy murky deep orange hue with a fat two finger white head that fades slowly to leave loads of creamy lacing and a dense creamy blanket. S - Aromas of bright juicy citrus and peel, decent amount of candied mango and tropical fruit. Flashes of dried fruit as well, tropical fruit leather. Good lighter malt sweetness. T - Taste is similar to the nose with nice juicy citrus and tangerine. Decent generic tropical fruits, not overly juicy, loads of dried fruit and fruit leather. Very, very soft bitterness. M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, medium bodied. With there was a bit more carbonation here to help with the fluffiness. O - Overall this was a solid IPA. Glad I never gave in to the hype years ago as apparently this is quite accessible now. Really enjoyable. Serving Type: Can"

No head, thus no retention or lacing. Lots of sludge left in the bottom the bottle as well. Lots of dark fruit and malt scents in the nose, reminds me of a Belgian Quad. Very similar on the tongue, with some noticeable alcohol heat. The body was smooth, even, and had a sweet finish, but the lack of carbonation was an issue. Drinkability was OK, but, some carb would have made it great-to-excellent. Overall, another great beer from HotD, but, please y'all, put some bubbles in."
5585,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.65,"Very drinkable at 5% ABV. Taste of multiple types of fruit. very limited availability in the USA, but for the high price would recommend other lambic beers as an alternative. Either way, solid offering if you can get it."
5586,Tweak,99,Stout - American Imperial,16%,4.81,"Served in a teku glass from the bottle.  Appearance: Semi thick dark bown tinted body pouring a bit like crude oil. Dark deep in color with medium bubbles to the body creating a tan head rising maybe just one finger's length off the body. Settles quick after one sip with a nice even lacing. Smell: Chocolate whiskey aroma with hints of espresso. I let the beer warm up and seriously intense in the nostrils.  Taste: Complex toffee and chocolate with hints of pure coffee bean with notes of whiskey. You are all over the place while inhaling this brew. Toffee and malts might be too much of a congestion but seriously this one is a dessert.  Mouth: Stick-icky with a medium carbonation. Body is incredibly full, which the after taste just lingers with you.  Overall: What is funny is that I have had this beer at least two to three times before today and never did a beer review. Might be my most favorite imperial stout produced by Avery brewing. The complexity alone is worth grabbing it, roughly about 15 a bottle here in New York. Salud!"
5587,The Streets,99,IPA - New England,10%,4.85,"Had the good fortune to get 24 of these,"
5588,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.65,"2016 Bottle poured into teku. Orange, clear, crisp, active carbonation, frothy off white head. Citrus zest, grapefruit rind aroma. Slightest hint of funk, some tart apple. Flavor combines light zesty citrus (lemon) with earthy grass/hay. Some oak balances the tartness and melds with wine grape. A bit of sweetness smooths out a light layer of funk. Moderate carbonation, soft, tart, medium body. Overall an excellent brew, excited to try the next vintage that I have in my cellar."
5589,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.66,"People differ in opinion, but I loved the fruity, tart, bitter and slightly funky flavor. Look: Hazy golden with a thin white head Aroma: tart green apples and apricot Flavor: The flavor is tart apple, pear, apricot, maybe orange, some yeasty funk, maybe white wine, a dry oakie bitterness at the end. It is delicious. Feel: it's light and refreshing"
5590,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.61,Awesome!
5591,Caffè Americano,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.67,"L - Pitch, opaque black with a thin dark tan head that dissipates quickly leaving behind no head. "
5592,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.73,"I don't think it pours as dark as everyone says. I certainly don't think that light disappears into it like a black hole, and there even seems to be a slight purple/reddish ting around the edges. The nose is bourbon and dark malts. Sort of like what I wish my wife smelled like after work. Some caramel notes. Taste is bourbon and dark malts. Sort of like what I wish my wife tasted like after work. A little oaky, touch of cake. Feel is smooth and silky, not to thick, not to thin. Sort of like what I wish my wife felt like after work."
5593,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.72,"I became a big Toppling Goliath fan over the past few years and traveled out to the brewery in August 2019. Assassin was on tap and it was the best beer in the joint. My draft was a beautiful midnight black with light lacing, thick and bold with rich mouthfeel. Slightly boozy aroma. Chocolate notes blend magnificently with coffee on the back end. There were a lot of excellent beers to try but I did several Assassins and made a stop back on my way out of town the next day for another one. This brew was deadly good! Give Decorah, Iowa a try. It's a great small town - filthy dirty (in a good way) with Norse culture and a few great breweries. How can you go wrong?!?"
5594,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,3.6,"This gold-waxed 750ML bottle is the last of the booty we hauled back from our San Diego Christmas vacation. Le sigh. Time for more warmth. Soon.  About as dark as any stout, the brew introduces itself with vanilla, roast, cinnamon, & a hint of cream.  B-Bomb w/Coffee & Cinnamon: too much cinnamon. With the proliferation of beers containing Ceylon bark, I am coming to the conclusion that any more than a pinch of the stuff is too much for this beer drinker. It seems to bludgeon everything into submission with a wrist-thick beaver stick. Moderate roast, nutmeg, mild chocolate, with barrel that’s more sensed than tasted. It’s sippability quotient is easily its strongest attribute.  I love Fremont. I don’t love this. Pretty good is the best I can muster. Damn cinnamon."
5595,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.79,2016 bottle poured into a teku. 
5596,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.63,"Pretty Ridiculous. Creamy, juicy, smooth. Has an earthy, nutty, grassy taste I was not expecting for something called ""juice machine."" I was not blown away because you know I live in the northeast.... but certainly one of the best beers I've ever had."
5597,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,5.0,Rating is for 2013 Vintage:
5598,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.03,"Absurdly opaque yellow-tan with a minimal, bubbly white blanket. Smell is sweaty mango and peach with dank af cannabis and a hint of biscuit, while taste continues to bring on mango, mostly green, with a touch of pine, and even more juicy peach. The medium-thin body has a smooth, crisp carbonation that expands to a filling froth before a bone dry finish. An unbalanced treat, but I actually enjoyed regular a bit more."
5599,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.35,"2018 vintage. About six months from bottling.  A: Pours jet black with a thick ring of dark brown, espresso-like head. No lacing and average retention. S: Suuuuper rich dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, vanilla bean, dry oak barrel and cinnamon, and light bourbon. A little bit of cardboard. A very brawny BA stout. T: Dark chocolate, vanilla, cola, light spice (cinnamon, clove) and light toasted oak, a bit of sherry and roastiness. Pretty long finish. The barrel is not very noticeable on the palate. As you might guess from the base, this is super sweet; the barrel and vanilla balances this out somewhat but not completely. Like a liquid candy bar. M: Sticky full body and medium, sharp carbonation that thankfully cuts through the massive body. A comforting alcohol warmth gently warms your innards.  O: Big, sweet, rich, and pretty tasty beer. The cardboard note is distracting, and the sweetness is as overwhelming as it is in regular DL. I’d always heard that, even though the base beer is terrible, adding it to barrels transformed it in such a way to somehow make it ethereal. That’s half true, I guess. I can’t drink more than like 4oz of this stuff."
5600,Alter Ego,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.25,"Probably has the most bitter flavor of any TH beer I’ve had yet but it has enough sweetness to balance it. Smells of tropical fruit and oily hop, taste follows suit with just enough hop complexity to satisfy you with enough blended tropical fruit and citrus flavors to keep everything in check. Delicious."
5601,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.53,"L - 1.5 finger white-pinkish head is slow to recede. Body is a murky, opaque maroon. S - tons of sweet, tart raspberries. Brown sugar. Oak. T - raspberries for days. Real raspberries too, not artificial sweetness. Tart, brown sugar, only moderately sour. No bitterness. Low sweetness. No booziness. F - medium body and carb. O - this is one amazing fruited sour."
5602,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.31,"A - Pours a pitch black with a one finger tan head. Very light soapy lacing. S - Aroma is maple, roasted malts and bacon. T - The taste is maple, coffee, roasted malts and salty bacon. M - Medium/light body with carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a crisp finsih. O - Very solid breakfast porter. Big flavors without a huge alcohol punch. Definetly recommended to fans of adjunct porters."
5603,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.59,"L: Burgundy, mocha, and maroon opaque hues with literally no head whatsoever"
5604,Doubleganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.34,"Pours an opaque yellow/light orange with a big pillowy white head. Leaves good lacing. Smell is slighly sweet tropical and stone fruit (reminds me of smelling dried mango and peach) and dank hops. Great full bodied mouthfeel; chewy and juicy. Medium carbonation and smooth. Taste is well balanced; also tropical and stone fruit sweetness and floral bitterness. Only a very slight warming booziness. Another solid Tree House offering, but not one in the upper echelon of theirs that I would choose if I had my personal pick."
5605,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,3.53,"Pint can in a curvy beer glass. Another murky straw colored glass of juice. Thin white cap, loads of lacing. Heavy dose of citrus aroma with a pineapple tropical mix. Stinks up a bit as it warms. Any malt or wheat? It’s fruit juice as far as flavor goes. Juicy medium bodied, fairly smooth. Lasting bitterness. Another glass of juice from TH masquerading as a beer."
5606,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,5.0,"Has a very barrel forward nose, defined by leather, wet basement, moldy wood and yogurt. The interesting thing about this is, that there is a recognizable freshness, coming from the base beer, at the same time. It provides aromas of lemon zest, soft wheat and dried herbs, building up a perfectly enjoyable collision. Has a fine effervescence with a light, sour and dry body, making this remarkably refreshing, with a nice smoothness to it. Tastes of an initial flavor explosion on the palate, mellowed by a pleasant yeast silkness, enriching unripe grapefruits, kiwi pulp, mushrooms and blue cheese amongst warming campfire wood. Turns a tad sweeter, with toffee joining in, highlighting the oranges by adding a fruity sweetness, entagled into the oak. This gets softened by an aqueous quality, producing just a light hint of spices, perfectly integrating lemon zest and a late herb dryness with some prevailing mushrooms.  Incredibly well nuanced beer with an absolutely astonishing complexity, while it drinks almost too easy with a world class mouthfeel. This may be the closest thing i‘ve yet enjoyed so far to a belgian saison / lambic from the US and puts up this brewery with the very best in the world for me."
5607,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.16,"22 March 2020 - Beer #55 - BA Top 250 Alert! Corona Day #10 Price: $59.99 at Healthy Spirits 15th Street in San Francisco Appearance: 5 - a glowing apricot orange. Thick bubbly head for days. Nose: 4 - yeah, it's a Gueuze for better or worse. For some reason I always get a briny kind of smell on these, like vinegar or pickles. Here's one: you know what your piss smells like after you have asparagus? This. Taste: 4 - not as good as the Cuvee Armand & Gaston, which is my favorite Gueuze. Hefty vinegar / pickles here. Intensely flavored, though. Action packed. Mouth: 5 - tremendous. Extremely effervescent. The sourness and acidity make my mouth water even though it's already wet. Impressive. That was a pretty great description, so I copied / pasted from the Hommage review. Overall: 4 - an excellent example of the style, and one I'm glad I got to try. Wish I had gone to the other store that had the half size for half price, but hey, you only live once. Cheers!"
5608,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.22,"First pour displays a slight chill haze, yet still allows for a sparkling amber body with a thin creamy white head that fades to a film with a creamy ring and some rolling hills of lace. The full pour yields full haze. Smell is divine. Simple yet complex. Apple, pear, white wine oak, a hint of light aged cheese funk, and sharp passionfruit. Juicy starts smooth and round on the palate with some soft carbonation, a crisp tart middle, and a sharp, tart, tingly, semi-dry finish...but what are these flavors? Seriously! It's so well-made and integrated it's a challenge identifying descriptors. Pear. Passionfruit. Nelson-like hops. Crisp, tart tangerine. White wine oak. It's champagne-esque, but also nearing balsamic territory. Kiwi! All kept anchored by some bitter grapefruit rind. A very good beer, but definitely not the absolute stunner I was led to believe it to be. I would probably put some effort into obtaining another at one point, but actually the beer I had the day before, a similar but local BottleHouse En Foret, impressed me much more, although, it did have added fruit."
5609,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.49,"B3, hoppypocket, can't thank you enough. Tons of barrel on the nose. Tons of wine barrel, good mineral notes, decent sour. Different and not quite what I was expecting (not in a bad way) would drink again ;-)"
5610,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.29,"Copper colored with a very clear complexion. Moderate, soapy lacing is present. There’s a three quarter inch creamy brown head. There’s a pungent citrus aroma. I’m tasting a massively bitter tangerine and citrus forward double IPA. The mouth is resinous, dry, and crisp."
5611,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,99,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,7%,3.94,"750 ml ""champagne"" bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7%. Red colour, large pink head. Strong sourish-fruity aroma of ripe red berries (= cherries, raspberries and cranberries), also notes of oak and farmhouse. Lovely clean sour & fruity flavour with a strong presence of said berries, some sweetness but not too much. Refined and interesting, but still refreshing and easy drinking for its strength and age."
5612,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.46,"Had on tap at the Whetstone Station, Brattleboro. L — Pours an orangey amber haze with a small white head that dissipates quickly but laces well. Doesn’t look as murky as some NEIPAs can - the haze is more inviting	"
5613,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.46,"08/2014 - This shit is crack; impressive bourbon, caramel, cocoa, malts too up front; sweet, flavorful, bourbon, coffee, lactose, vanilla on the palate; solid mouthfeel that lingers."
5614,Fundamental Observation,100,Stout - American Imperial,14.3%,4.43,"Pours pitch black with little to no head Smells of fudge and dark raisins Taste begins with toasty notes, as it warms more of the bourbon and alcohol heat come through but never in an overwhelming way.  Feel is quite nice- not overly viscous but chewy enough to keep my mouth occupied A great heavy hitter that doesn’t over do it"
5615,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.71,"750mL 2016 bottle poured into a Dark Lord Teku. Thanks Ray for sharing this one.  Pours a thick dark brown/nearly black body with a tan head that reduces to a ring.  Aromas are complex and inviting, with lots of bourbon and dark fruits, oak and caramel, cocoa, chocolate, some vanilla in there, alcohol heat. Great combination of flavors on the tongue, I can taste the base beer slightly but it's really complimented with rich bourbon cake flavors, fudgy caramel brownie, dark fruits and coffee on the follow through. Pretty rich mouthfeel, medium-low carbonation, very easy drinking for 15%.  BA Dark Lord is a great example of what a BA Imperial Stout can take like without adjuncts. Super complex, flavorful, balanced."
5616,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.51,"A: Pours a near pitch black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap S: Roasted malt, maple syrup, dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, caramel, and a touch of dark fruit T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of roasted malt, coffee, and maple. Goes into the dark chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. Not super sweet. Finishes with lingering roast and maple M: Medium-full bodied with low-moderate carbonation O: A very nice stout that has plenty of the maple and coffee going on. The sweetness of the maple is balanced nicely by the roasted malt and coffee with the chocolate backs things up on both ends. Makes for a great sipper"
5617,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.39,"Straw and slightly hazy with a few small, slow rising bubbles and 4 fingers of white head. Smells of brett and funk, oranges, lemons and Belgian yeasts, some fresh plastic like a German Heffe.  Light and subtly sour with lemons, orange rind and Brett, barrel funk, and nail polish.  Light and crisp, tart body with a smooth carbonation. Goes down really easy. I got this at St Adairius in Santa Cruz earlier this year, and am drinking it in Redding, July 11th, 2019. Excellent, smooth drinking offering."
5618,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.42,Batch 3
5619,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.44,"Bottle, RBESG 2007 in Glasgow, Grand Tasting. Pitch black colour, creamy brown head. Very nice aroma of chocolate and roasted malts, hints of oak. Intensely rich and complex flavour: oaky, vinous, roasty, chocolate, liquorice. An excellent beer, but so is the ""ordinary"" Stormaktsporter."
5620,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.53,"A: Milky, pale yellow. Soft head and visibly viscous."
5621,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.2,"To-go can, getting to finally try a Degarde for the 2nd time. The color looks stone fruit peach oranges. The smell is very distinct of sourness, vinegary, slight fruit notes. Overall I was hoping for that special first sip that takes my breath away but a bit disappointment bit nevertheless, it's good. Cheers"
5622,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.39,"Pours a mango-orange with a murky transparency and a finger of white foam that retains well. Aroma is earthy papaya, tangerine and grapefruit with a little stone and yeast beyond. It's tropical fruit opening lingers for a while, letting the base pale ale (which is already very hoppy) show throw in fragments. Aroma is akin to a very powerful NE IPA. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, mango, tangerine with a little earthy, nutty malt and raw grain and yeast to sooth things out. It's tropical fruit through and through, and drinks very similar - identical - to Trillium's Northeast IPA (this is labeled as an American Pale Ale at the time of review). All this to say, it's incredible hop forward, much more so than other pale ales, which may be a deterrent for some. Mouth feel is a little gritty, silty and soft, with a medium-thick consistency. It's liken to a well-worn lumpy, linen pillow. Overall, despite a slightly misleading style, the name of the beer lets those knowledgeable about beer that the hop content is going to be high, thus I will not knock it for the style mis-interpretation. It's big and flavorful, which is welcome in a beer. It combines well with the lightly gritty texture to develop a refined, but well-worn and knowledgeable, experience. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 16oz can."
5623,The Broken Truck,100,Wild Ale,5%,4.12,"Hazy pineapple juice yellow with a large fuzzy white froth that dies quickly to a lightly spotty film. Smell is pungent, sweaty apricot, aged hops, grapefruit and weed. Taste is smoother than the nose suggests, but still pungent of peach and grapefruit, sort of like the 2013 Vigneronne we just had before it. Actually this is better, but the Vig seemed a bit off, as though it hadn't aged well. This BT also has a touch of lemon rind. As it warms, and you get closer to the sediment, the oaky funky actually becomes a bit cedary--very unique! Effervescent froth runs through the prickly, wildly complex and tart medium body with a semi-dry finish.  b4"
5624,Great,100,Barleywine - American,14%,4.6,"On tap at NC Rare 1/28/17. Caramel color. Smell was caramel, dark fruit, malts. Tasted more like an English barleywine. No hops at all. Mostly caramel, dates, raisin, mild barrel. Overall, this was a fantastic beer. The barrel was not overdone like a lot of BA barleywines."
5625,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.5,"Bought in Tampa, FL. Poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: The beer is a cloudy cola brown with a dark tan frothy head of 2-3 fingers with good retention. S: Smells like dessert. Heavy on the maple as if smelling a bottle of syrup. Bacon is of the candied sort and is just a light note in the nose. There is more cinnamon and a slightly roasted character. Vanilla, caramel. Biscuits or pancakes or pie crust. Like the smell of an IHOP when you open the door. A really good smelling beer, noticeable from a distance. T: Actually a strong smoked malt character comes out in front. The coffee really leads this, more like a vanilla latte than a roasted black coffee which was interesting. Then some smoked meat comes in, the idea of the bacon creeping in at the edges. It really comes in layers - next is the maple, like a side of pancakes, and a buttery malty character behind. For as strong as the maple was in the nose, this actually was lighter on the sweetness which was a pleasant surprise, and it's not at all cloying. F: The weakest aspect of the beer is it can be called that. A bit lighter feeling, but still coating.  Overall: This is a really elevated porter. Drinkable yet unique. Dessert but not cloying. I'll definitely get this again if I see it."
5626,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.42,"L -- Pours a very deep brown body with a scant half finger of pale brown head produced with aerated pour. Head recedes quickly, leaving a small ring of foam around the edge of the glass. No lacing"
5627,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.45,"750ml bottle. No dating information found, but the label does read ""Coffee is delicate. Please store cold and enjoy within 60 days for ideal flavor and aroma.""."
5628,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.42,"Batch 3. Bottled a few months ago. A: Pours black, viscous, with a smattering of dark brown head that dissipates to a razor-thin ring almost immediately. No lacing, no retention to speak of. A few flecks of coconut on the surface.  S: Toasted coconut and dark chocolate bar, light roast, vanilla extract, and sweetness. T: Thick, melted dark chocolate, toasted coconut, a touch of tannic roastiness on the middle of the tongue, vanilla bean. Medium sweetness brights out the dessert-like character.  M: Extremely thick, full bodied, chewy, with light carbonation—a bit lower than needed to cut the body. Just a wisp of alcohol heat.  O: Not mindblowing, but pretty tasty dessert beer. The thickness and sweetness limit the drinkability, making it difficult to enjoy more than a small taster’s worth."
5629,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.52,"Sweet tangerine citrus, tropical hoppy, bready/biscuity, and dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a nice tropical hoppy and piney-dank bitter bite...some grapefruit citrus bitterness shows up on the backend. This is so soft and juicy on the palate. Outstanding!"
5630,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.26,"16 ounce cans at share. I hit the Trillium trifecta tonight, getting to try three of their double dry hopped ales. The Fort point was no exception. Very well-crafted, citrusy, fruity, with a nice lingering bitterness that seems to go on forever. Juicy and silky smooth."
5631,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.27,"On draft in canton.  Completely hazy, light, pineapple juice color. "
5632,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.53,"Got to have this last week at the Hops & Pie Sourfest 2019 in Denver, Colorado. What an epic day of drinking that was. You know what I liked there more than any other American beer? This one.  Pours a light reddish/purple and pink- color with 1/3"" lighter pink head. The aroma is heavy on the cherry, quite nice. Go Balaton! Taste, wow, just wow. Feels like they used 3lbs of cherry per gallon or some absurd metric conveying a shit ton of cherries. So much cherry, but there isn't an equally thick viscous cold medicine like feel to it. They draft up a relatively innocuous body for the beer. A lot of beers talk about their pie like qualities but this one pushes cherry pie weight like no other. Any acidity is restrained as can be. Oak is mild, spontaneous funk notes are as well. Easily my favorite Jester King beer, and there have been a few excellent ones along with this one. Good cherry skin and pit dryness complimenting it all the way down.  Dammit, I kinda hate that I love this beer so much, given that its not available to me."
5633,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.5,"Picked-up a single can at Tree House Brewery in Charlton for $4.44. My seventy fourth brew from these guys. Very nice stout, appreciate the price point."
5634,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,3.74,"Slick mouthfeel. Chewy. Taste is intense, chocolate covered raisins is my best effort at describing it. Bourbon is absent. Would've liked to try it fresh."
5635,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.71,"750ml bottle, batch 4. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a clear golden-yellow body, slight straw hue, one finger thick white head, good retention, not much lacing. Smell is brilliant funk, white vinous character, mild-moderate vinegar acidity, light oak, minerals, a bit of underripe peach. Wonderful stuff, so complex. Flavour is similar; there is more of a moderate acidic presence behind the oak and white vinous character. Light cereal grain, mineral and cobweb funk. This is one of the best saisons as far as the flavour goes; the complexity is fantastic. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart and a little dry, and the glass seems to empty itself a bit too quickly, strangely enough. Vinous and light vinegar acidity finishes things off. Overall, fantastic beer that is up there amongst the best of the style."
5636,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.9,Had side-by-side with KBBS and it won the night. Retains all the amazing notes of regular Abraxas with a perfect barrel character and mouth feel. Amazing beer!
5637,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.99,"Given to me by @jvgoor3786, and damn, am I glad for that! This is a real great beer. To quote Monty Python, black as the ace of spades, he was, with slightly brownish/purple thinning edges. Had half a fingertip of quickly dissipating head that left a minimal amount of lacing. Smell is a balanced mixture of bourbon barrel, chocolate, and malt. Well, maybe the barrel is more prevalent than the other two. On taste, however, it’s a lot more balanced between the three, with a little bit of vanilla and a bit of a fruity red wine note in there for good measure. Everything comes together-it’s sweet, roasty, and has a tangy, woodsy burn from the barrel. Feel is maybe where this outstanding beer is most outstanding. It’s big and bold from the barrel, but there’s some subtle silky smoothness from the malt and sweet adjuncts. Mouth watering and a healthy alcohol presence. The only thing I can say about it being ranked in the top 250 beers is that 172 may be too low. Thanks tons for sending me this one, Jason, and thanks to Ozark Beer Company for an awesome beer."
5638,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.37,"Really gorgeous beer here - and the oak wine barrels give it a nice complexity. I really wasn't even sure what a nectarine was, but I definitely know now!"
5639,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.44,Had it on draft. Very dark brown color with a creamy brown head and great lacing. Rich chocolate cake smell and taste. Dark coffee and cappuccino flavors become more pronounced as it warms. Hint of strawberry. Very rich and silky smooth feel. Great beer!
5640,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.75,"I’m not sure if I’ve ever rated a beer this high before. The color was an opaque orange juice. Nose was slight bitter hop with many tropical fruits and citrus taking center stage. Taste follows suit but bitter hop is almost not there, rather a slight dank taste is present on the back end but the front is all fruit and citrus puree. Mouthfeel is so pillowy and soft it’s reminiscent of a stout or thick porter. This beer was excellent and I will seek out more."
5641,Saison Bernice,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.69,I thought this beer was fantastic. 
5642,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.43,Pour is a murky bright yellow with a finger and half of chalk white foam. Great retention and lacing.
5643,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.6,"Bright, refereshing, peppery, orange citrus, piney, balanced bitterness, nice lingering bitterness. Big, boozy, but so well balanced. Very drinkable for 10%. Great beer."
5644,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.23,"A: sweet and light boozy with green apple, cocoa nibs, plum, dark red fruits, licorice  A: opaque black with little head, light carbonation.  F: apple cider, roasted malts, caramel, fog, prune, rasin, toffee  M: medium body with moderate carbonation. Finishes balanced with smoothly and silky roasted malts, charred oak, and green apple O: very nice beer. Blend of roasty malts, some char, and green apples."
5645,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.98,"To me, this is about as close to a perfect beer. The best part is how hidden the alcohol is. Sure you can't crush a bunch of these but just one could be just enough. With it's limits, that makes perfect sense to me."
5646,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.74,"The beer pours a some what Clear copper orange with a large fluffy white head. It has medium high carbonation. The beer smells of kiwi, white grape gooseberry, white wine, orange marmalade, and grapefruit. It tastes of kiwi, gooseberry, white grape, white wine, orange marmalade, and barnyard funk. The feel is light and juicy. This is an amazing wine ba saison, it’s tropical, juicy, and funky."
5647,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.51,"Canned 4/30/21. ""Whadayamean Juice Machine?!"" stamped on the bottom of the can Look what we have here, the legendary Juice Machine. Currently sitting at the 5th highest rated NEIPA and 18th highest rated overall, I'm very excited to try this one. It seemed as if every time I went up to Tree House they got this in the day after so I've been missing out until now. Let's see what this one is all about Pours a hazy golden orange with 3+ fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing The hops here do something that many TH beers do not by adding a tartness in terms of tropical flavors, which is a nice change of pace. I'm picking up on aromas of lime, dank weed, creamy peach, orange juice, white pepper, papaya, light mango, and a round doughy malt Ok so the delicate nuance of the nose drops a bit in translation to taste, but it is still damn good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange juice, creamy peach, doughy malt, light pine, and mango. The swallow brings notes of lemon peel, orange creamsicle, white pepper, piney hops, and doughy malt A medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a thick and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a hint of earthy spice A really good beer right here, but I've had better from them. It's close, but this doesn't beat King Julius for me"
5648,Montmorency Vs Balaton,99,Wild Ale,6.1%,4.44,"Appearance - The beer poured from the bottle a hazy reddish pink color with white bubbles crowning the glass.  Smell - The nose radiated fresh cherries. It was more tart than sweet, but amazingly fresh.  Mouthfeel - as with my notes about the smell, the taste was fresh cherries. The leaning was more tart than sweet, but very pleasant. I would compare it to cherry preserves. The overall profile was a little more acidic than I would normally like, but the sweetness provided good balance. The taste was tart all the way through to the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Particularly for the style, the beer was very full bodied. Overall - Some have described this as being like cherry juice. I would suggest the tartness disqualifies that label. The beer really shines when it is served closer to room temperature."
5649,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.28,"Canned on 8/5/20; consumed on 8/19/20 Pours a turbid, dark peach/carrot juice hue capped with multiple fingers of rocky, white foam; great head retention leaves mounds of chunky cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a modest spread of thinner, soapy, webby/spotty lacing around the glass. Aroma starts off sweet and grassy upfront, welcoming in apricot, sweet, musty mint, papaya, and grapefruit rind steadily; a consistent grassiness persists over the middle to softly undercut the building tropical overtones before wisps of uniquely dank red berries ease through the finish. Taste features juicy, overripe peach in waves upfront and accented with hints of nectarine, grapefruit oils, and mango; the tropical amalgam maintains across the palate as lemon and lime fade with the finish and hints of bubblegum linger (in typical Tree House fashion). Mouthfeel shows a medium body with a subtle, moderate carbonation; presents silky with a mild hop prickle developing as it becomes creamy, juicy and pithy past the mid-palate and remains consistent to the finish, where it maintains a plush quality and vague bitterness on the swallow. A confounding and intense experience, so heavily saturated in a flowing hop nuance and begging for perfection, and yet maybe too intense for its own good; there's a certain lack of order that prevents individual elements from shining through, and can be counted as possibly the sole reason this is only an excellent (as opposed to world-class) NEIPA."
5650,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.58,"A killer bottle that is the furthest thing from the pervasive hazy IPAs and pastry stouts. An English Old Ale aged in bourbon barrels that just tastes like you’re sipping it in a 17th century pub. Sticky sweet toffee, vanilla, tons of oak, caramel, figs, and dried sweet cherries."
5651,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.52,"Pours black with two fingers of caramel colored foam. Head retention is great. Aroma is big chocolate, coffee, toffee and roasted and toasted malts and barley. It's huge. Flavor profile is coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, toffee and roasted and toasted malts with some bitter barley. It tastes big. Mouth feel is velvety and thick. Overall, sublime coffee stout. Big coffee combined with a big stout for a win-win.  Draft. Reviewed on phone. 10oz pour into a stemmed large wine glass."
5652,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.66,Look: ruby brown with a 1 inch thick khaki head.
5653,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.5,Stout brewed with four different coffee styles. Extremely well balanced with coffee finish and extensive aftertaste. Color is pure and taste is fantastic. Had on tap at Other Half as well. Solid coffee taste and good stout.
5654,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.13,"Super hazy Yellow. Small white head. Very good retention.  AROMA: citrus, grass. Simple, but strong and pleasant.  TASTE: super juicy, grapefruit, then pineapple, then maybe hint of lemon and/or orange. Bittering finish, similar to Trillium Vicinity (previous beer), but this one is more mellow. A little peppery.  FEEL: Clean and smooth. Light to medium body. **"
5655,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.49,"Picked up a four pack at beer store today and didn't know too much about it. Saw the ratings and I was stoked. This is a well balanced DIPA. I am a big fan of the super hazy NEIPAs and this is not overly smoggy, but it is delicious. This is a great brew for a warm afternoon on the front porch!"
5656,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.39,Look is cloudy dark stew colored with 2 fingers of slightly off white head. Smell is tropical fruits like mango and papaya maybe and some pine coming up through the background. Taste is sweet mango and other tropical fruits followed by a nice punch of pine and some bitter grapefruit as well. Feel is soft and smooth as every ipa I've had from them has been so far. Overall an excellent DIPA. It's bold and balanced. It's also a punch in the mouth but with a very soft feel to it. Really well done.
5657,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,3.99,**
5658,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.53,"Poured on draft at the Fat Head's Saloon. Very floral and juicy. Tropical. A West coast style hop bomb. Bitter enough to let you know you're drinking a hoppy fuckin beer, but balanced and extremely flavorful."
5659,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.48,"Bomber received in a trade 2017 edition, opened 2.16.19 Motor oil liquid, one finger brown frothy foam cap quickly recedes Aroma of roast coffee, maple, whiff of bacon  Taste is roasted coffee, maple , bacon , tobacco Thinner mouthfeel , medium sudsing  Good beer"
5660,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.83,L: Thick mocha and onyx pour that results in a rich sandy head
5661,Hop JuJu,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,4.6,"Can dated 2-18-21. GLBC tulip. A: pours a bright, crystal-clear orangey-gold. One finger white head dissolves quickly to a 1/16 skim of foam that lasts. Tiny stream of carbonation coming from the center. Looks how I want and expect a DIPA to look, except not much lacing to speak of. S: immediately when I cracked the can open I smelled the hops from a foot and a half away. Smells sweet, tropical, piney and floral. More tropical aromas than I expected, actually. Pineapple, mango. Hyacinth?  T: initial burst of lightly sweet tangy hoppiness, crisp, crackery malt center on mid palate with the hops beginning to express themselves, turning at the end to a big, brash, bold explosion of dank, floral, “high note” hops. The slightest hint of alcohol is detectable on the finish, blended in with that bold, lingering floral hop bite. M: this beer really stands out in terms of feel; it is supremely crisp for something so big. Never cloying, and for as bruising as it should be for this ABV and IBU, it is remarkably drinkable. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a bruiser of a beer, but it feels remarkably light on the palate for the style. Not astringent at all. Pretty low carb, not much of the “fluff” I enjoy from ales. Hard at this gravity. O: I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, I am too old to be drinking beers like this. It is a big, potent, relatively clean hop wallop if that is what you are in the mood for. Tropical and floral, not oniony or garlicky, or too piney on the palate, which is good for me. Although there is a good, crisp, clean malt presence, this beer is totally out of balance in favor of hops. Although the alcohol is well hidden, it is noticeable on the finish and this will impair you on the first beer (esp. in a 16 ounce can!) perfectly to style. I came, I saw, I conquered. More than anything, the craftsmanship of this beer makes me want to revisit the other Fat Heads beers I haven’t had in a while, and to try some of those I haven’t had before."
5662,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.05,"L - 2016 tell poor. Extremely thin and extremely light for a big stout. Not what I expected. Head is just barely off white, and very frothy and pillowy - very nice here. S - muted parabola and ZERO coffee. I have nothing else to add. T - Thankfully there's some coffee here, very strong, dark coffee too. The sweet parabola base balances the bitter coffee elequontly.  M - nice, oily and creamy. Not huge, but all around just nice. Overall - this was one of my MOST looked forward to beers that I traded for in the last year and a half. Sadly, while solid, it's nothing great and comes as a pretty big letdown for the stature it's known for."
5663,Dragonsaddle,99,IPA - New England,11.5%,4.56,"This is the upper echelon of of triple IPA’s. The aroma is full of citrus fruit and tropical notes, coming at my nose with waves of dank hops, lots of grapefruit, tangerine and sweet grassy notes. Flavor is super juicy and full of citrus with tangerine, mango, guava, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, faint lemon zest, some lactose sugar or a creamy essence, then it brings sweet malt, grains, floral notes and graham cracker. It hides the ABV masterfully and is a terrific representation of this style."
5664,Abricot Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.85,Pours a orangish opaque color with a small white head. Smells of funky sour apricots. Taste is very acidic and tart with a pungent sour finish. A realmouth puckered. But in a great way. Wonderful thick mouthfeel.

5667,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,3.38,"Bottle at share from Todd. Orange/pinkish pour, flat. Fruity, sweet aroma, hints of brandy. Taste brings tartness, notes of grapes, hint of tomato. Earthy."
5668,Stickee Monkee,99,Quadrupel (Quad),12.5%,4.43,"Very dark brown, headless but does have a ring around the edge. Nice aroma: molasses, alcohol, charred oak, vanilla & caramel. Plenty of sweetness here. Flavor: add brown sugar to the barrel flavors, caramel & a little grain with just a hint of bitter at the finish. Feel is silky smooth, medium thick with some alcohol burn. Delicious!"
5669,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.72,"Pours a twilight brown, half inch of creamy head, good retention. Aroma is a very smooth roasted malt, milk chocolate, espresso beans and creme fraiche. Taste is simple but evocative - the malt backbone is deceptively clean, highlighting that roasted malt flavor perfectly, elements of cappuccino, foam latte, burnt nut and pumpernickel. One of the best porters out there"
5670,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.48,"I'm not sure it lives up to the hype even though it's a great beer. It has nearly a solid black body with light brown foam (although it doesn't have much of head). Smell contains a lot of the bourbon/vanilla flavor one would expect. Taste delivers as well, with a nice cherry body in the middle. Very light carbonation and feels pretty light for what it is, which I'm not sure is exactly ideal. Overall I'd highly recommend for the flavor but I don't know if it merits the 100 it currently has."
5671,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,5.0,It smells like coffee and bourbon.  There is the sweet woody smell of the bourbon backed up by the bold coffee stout. It tastes sweet up front with a punch of liquor and then it's like a bitter bold chocolaty coffee.  It's so much like Founders Breakfast Stout but just stronger in every way. It's got a medium body and is smooth in every way. The bubbles are smooth the liquid itself is smooth and then the finish is smooth bitterness and a little bit of wood. Wow that's delicious.  It's better than the Mackinac Fudge and the Espresso varieties that I thoroughly enjoyed before ever having the real thing.  It's my favorite stout so far. 6 out of 6.
5672,Bourbon Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.7%,4.53,"A- Stubby 12oz into a becher with a motor oil pour and a dark, deep brown cap that rises up minimally to a foam layer and recedes to a bubbly belt around the edges of the glass. Fair head retention and spotty lacing. S- Brownie desserts that are just saturated with cocoa powder and have a heavy but not overbearing coconut presence. The vanilla comes in next and the base stout is imposing in this brew. Once the beer has some time to breath the barrel opens up a lot with sticky charred Bourbon oak and whiskey notes. Burnt barley, caramel, nuttiness, toffee and a tiny hint of candied dark fruit. T- The thing that makes the biggest difference on the palate is the booze which cuts into the sweetness and serves to minimalize that brownie dessert effect. The beer feels a bit more coconut forward but it is not centered around that flavor with toasted coconut notes joined by dark chocolate, espresso, roast barley, spicy Bourbon, vanilla bean and milk chocolate notes. Caramel, toffee, spiced dark fruit, cherry, leather, oak wood and nuttiness also come to mind. MF- Hefty heavy bodied brew with a medium-low carbonation level. The beer is a oily and a touch syrupy. It puffs up a bit with a slight creaminess but the high alcohol cuts into that. Ends very warm and bittersweet. One of those beers that has a stark, prominent foreground with layers and layers of wonderful things supporting those notes in the backdrop. The coconut, dark chocolate and barrel are big but you can dig and deep dive into this beer to find beautiful complexities."
5673,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.51,"A: Pours pitch black with a mocha colored head. Head is quite creamy looking with decent retention. Average lacing. Good looking but nothing special. S: Well, this smells like a very traditional but intense porter. There are chocolate malts, coffee notes (but not espresso), leather, pecans, vanilla and some very light cherries. This a dark, round and complex smelling porter. T: If the smell made me think of coffee without being espresso, the taste really puts the espresso right in the front and center. There is cacao powder, vanilla, leather, cherries (much stronger than in the smell), oak like tannins, pecans and a little bit of earth. The balance is wonderful and with very little residual sweetness. M: I've never had a Hill Farmstead beer that hadn't a perfect mouthfeel for the genre. This is the case here too: it's broad and round, heavy (but not too much) with a low and soft carbonation. O: This truly is a wonderful beer from an incredible brewery that doesn't seem to know how to brew a bad beer. The only thing I can say about this beer, and I think it's the first time I say it, is that it would benefit to have a little bit more sweetness. Not a lot, just a little bit. Also, with it's predominant espresso notes, this beer really sits in between a stout and a porter."
5674,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.46,"canned 1/4/2021 drank on 1/24/2021  Pours a turbid slightly murky orange with a cream head that leaves a full lacing. (Murkiness could be caused by some minimal oxidation)  Nose of grass, tropical and citrus fruit, minimal grains.  Taste follows with bitterness up front followed by notes of tropical fruit and orange. Fruit and bitterness lingers on the pallet. Very clean - no heavy flavors.  Feel is medium light with nice carb on the pallet.  overall this is an excellent ""NE"" IPA that is clean, nice bitterness, and excellent flavor coming from a nice selection of hops."
5675,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.81,2014 vintage...may 26th 2019....this is amazing! Every sip is a different experience. flavors all over the place. maple? vanilla? chocolate? Not nearly the viscosity of Sr-71 but LEAGUES ahead of all around! Worth trying.
5676,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.4,Drank from a 16 oz can dated 5/21/21. Golden opaque yellow with decent initial foam - poured partially into a glass to observe color. Very pleasant albeit strong and thick - good feel. Not sure I can really add to what's already been posted. Worthy of the hype.
5677,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,100,Strong Ale - American,13%,4.47,"A - Pours a very dark brown with a one finger creamy tan head. Nice amount of soapy lacing. S - Aroma is cinnamon, dark chocolate, oak and bourbon. T - The taste is cinnamon, dark chocolate, vanilla, light coffee, oak, leather and nice bourbon in the finish. M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with soft dry finish. O - This is impressive. The cinnamon and coffee don’t overpower the base beer. Mouthfeel is supreme. Great beer."
5678,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.88,2018 can. Thanks Russ.
5679,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.75,Poured from a bottle brought back from the source - clear dark mahogany with thin off white head leaving spotty lacing. Nose is malty with lots of dark stone fruit and spice. Taste follows with an uptick of the nose and a smooth creamy finish . Brought back memories of nights at the Kulminator. Outstanding.
5680,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.0,"16 oz. can. Murky orange body. Smells of onions, lime zest, tropical fruit, and sweet pale malt. Taste has strong orange and lime zest. Garlic comes behind it. The zippy hop flavors linger long into the back end. Slight earthy tones and a little sweetness in the finish. Medium heavy. Drinks pretty well for its size. It's still a big beer, but it delivers on flavor."
5681,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,5.0,Wow. This is easily the best sour I've ever had. Pours bright red in the glass with a trace of head. Hill Farmstead funk without being overpowering. Loved it!!!
5682,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,13.4%,4.59,"First 3 of the 4 pack were fresh and this last one is just short of a year in the cellar. Pours about as dark as it gets and just as you think there will be no head at all, a centimeter of thick foam slowly appears out of the abyss. Nose is vanilla, brown bread, leather, and what to me smells like brown sugar pop tarts. Taste is...damn that's fucking good. Pretty much what you'd expect from the nose but the thickness of this beer is pretty amazing considering the ABV and barrel aging. Some tobacco, and some residual sweetness really round this out. Overall, damn."
5683,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.64,"Had a crowler of this over the summer. Shared with two other people.  Poured into a Trillium tulip....this is one of the haziest, most opaque beers I've ever seen. Bright yellow orange in color with a white/off white head that lingers. Looks ""sticky"".  Aroma of grapefruit, orange rind and tropical fruit abound. Not as assertive as I thought it'd be but I find that some beers with insane hop amounts tend to be a touch muted on the nose.  Flavor....is this orange juice? Stuff tasted like it. It was like DDH Congress on steroids.... so much orange and grapefruit mixed with tropical fruits. Nice lingering bitterness with a dry finish.  Feel on this was ""thick"". Super creamy and sticky. The lacing on the glass was impressive as it left a ring that stuck every single time I took a sip. Very filling though.  Overall, this is one of the more memorable hop saturated beers I've ever had. Super in your face with flavor... just tons of citrus and tropical fruit on the palate. Great beer!"
5684,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.49,"Poured from a can (09Jun2021, DC) into a teku L: pours a completely opaque, slightly creamy, lighter yellow orange with a fluffy whipped egg whites head. Leaves thick lacing as the head fades, as does each sip. Good looking brew S: sweet, delicious tropical juice aroma right off the bat. Notes of mango, passionfruit, pineapple, peach, melon. Smooth, while sweet it’s moderate and not cloying - slight bit of citrusy (grapefruit/tangerine) bitterness but not much. As it warms get more melon, that kind of creamy peanut butter note as well - fairly rich, definitely inviting T: follows the nose very well, great fruit up front with a slight bitter note toward the finish to give it some depth. At first I get this mix of pineapple/mango with a healthy amount of grapefruit bite and tangerine sweetness. More of those citrus notes here than I got on the nose, flavor is also lighter than I expected. This gummy candy peach flavor in the middle with a hit of melon, paired with a slightly bitter pleasantly grassy note that carries into the medium finish F: medium/medium- body, medium carbonation. Smooth, lighter than I expected/the nose suggested if that makes sense. Very slightly drying O: finally getting around to reviewing this after having a number over the years, it’s so good! Sure some NY batches are better, but this is a great tropical and crushable brew"
5685,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.7,"Bottle. I have been waiting for this bitch for ages. I tried both the 2016 & 2018 batches. This was one of my biggest wants because I figured Hill Farmstead does everything else great, I bet they would nail a Barleywine as well. Oh, and it is barrel aged for like an eon. Aaron pours a dark brown. Not necessarily clear bodied behind the tint of the beer. A thin, defeated ring of diminutive bubbles rest steadily around the outer conversion of beer and glass; the only thing minute about this beer. The aroma rises out of the glass like a slothful perfume. Thick, damp whiffs of bourbon, raisins, toffee, and dessert wine. Detailed, rich, royal. The flavor marches in line with the nose. Heavy, sweet, and decadent. I think the older batch has a bit more complexity but lacks the barrel character of it's newer kin. I get some flavors of boozy dates and maple syrup from both, though. Of course the feel stands abreast with the other elements of the beer. Portly, heavy, and warming. Toothsome but intense. Definitely lived up to the hype I personally gave this beer. The best Barleywine I have ever had."
5686,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.13,"Pours a hazed gold with a thumb of eggshell colored head. Great head retention and lacing  S: Citrus notes T: Grapefruit, tangerines, dryness and drynessup front. Plenty of Citrus, loads of powdery dryness and papaya as this warms. Finishes dry with green melon, pommelo and a little strawberry  MF: Medium body, restrained carbonation and nice balance Nice take on the style, will revisit if I can find fresher, but this only 5 weeks old, liked it a little better on draft. Very drinkable"
5687,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.78,Had this when on tap at TG brewery in summer of 2018.
5688,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.5,"On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma has lots of fresh roasted coffee and sweet malts. Taste has astringent coffee, sweet malt and a light roasty bitterness. Balanced and tasty."
5689,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.83,"What do you have for breakfast in Florida? Well, I'm going with this. Sitting on a balcony looking at the beach I'm pouring this from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out beautiful for the style looking like coffee with highlights and not being too dark for a porter. Forms a great dense and creamy tan colored crown. The smell is a bomb of excellent coconut. Fresh coconut mixing with beautiful chocolate. Wow this could be a candle. The taste comes in with strong but good coffee and turns into that great coconut that lingers long after it's gone. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style with good carbonation and not too thick or thin. Perfect. This is an absolutely great porter that I wouldn't change anything about. But I will State one thing before I go! I would STILL choose a Death by Coconut over this!!!! I'm out!!!!"
5690,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,3.92,"love the drinkability of this, sessionable. plenty of tropical hop flavor on nose and mouth, plenty of orange peel and bite, still fluffy smooth. low abv% a nice break from higher IPAs"
5691,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.49,"Look: Poured a hazy yellow color. No translucence. There was a very delicate white head after pouring.  Smell: At the nose, there is Brett funk, some oak, and citrus. Not so in depth but simplistic.  Taste: very earthy with barnyard funk and a strange essence of wild mushrooms. Also notes of nectarine, citrus, and oak. Surprisingly not as overly sour as I expected; therefore keeping it easy on the palate.  Mouthfeel: just little acidity. Medium bodied.  Overall: Really enjoyed it. A very easy and approachable sour. Could easy enjoy another bottle. It does take after a gueuze with its distinctive earthiness and funk although I'm not aware if Beatification is a multiple year blend?"
5692,Permanent Funeral,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.31,"On tap at Arts and Crafts Beer Parlor, NYC. Pours a golden amber color that is mostly clear. A moderate layer of film retains well. The nose displays a plethora of resinous fruity hops. These include aromas of peach, apricot, nectarine, grapefruit and orange juice. Dank aromas of pine and grass hint at bitterness. Opens sweetly with full flavors of biscuity, honey and caramel malts. Balanced by slick and oily hops that impart a firm bitterness in the finish. The hops flavors highlight citrus and stone fruit, including grapefruit rind, orange, peach and apricot. Spicy and resinous with notes of pine and grass.  Medium to full bodied, mouth coating, smooth and well balanced. The carbonation is moderate and the finish is dry, bitter and with a touch of alcohol spice.  Drinks well for the high ABV. Good balance of bitter and sweet. A classic DIPA flavor profile. I enjoyed it."
5693,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.45,"Had a ways back, I think kumatmebrew sent the bottle ages ago, from notes…"
5694,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.5,"bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with coffee, which on paper sounds like the same thing a million other breweries are doing, but in reality, is unique as can be, more concentrated and intense in all aspects than almost anything else in this field i have had before, which is a large sample size for sure. the coffee here is so fresh, earthy, and rich. its roasted like crazy, with an obvious dark chocolate profile that blends in beautifully with all the dark malts, which in this case stand out more than in a lot of these due to the apparent lack of a sweet malty middle, its all dry and roasty, near black, with the only sweetness at all in here coming from the bourbon, which has honey and vanilla and toasted marshmallow aspects to its sweetness, but its not from grain. it almost tastes like an ice beer, like some of the water was frozen out to make the beer thicker and more pronounced in the flavors, the dark malt here is really deep, and the coffee is dosed heavily enough to match it all the way through. there is a lot of charred oak on this, a faint hint of coconut and raisin right up front, and lots more chocolate. the whiskey is pretty strong here too, but it brings the coffee together with the wood and the heft of the grain. rich vanilla and maple notes in it, and just a little warming alcohol. this is amazingly complex and delicious, a hell of a breakfast beer, and another reason why i am increasingly obsessed with this brewery! this is one of the best of its kind!"
5695,Darkness,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,12%,4.51,"2019 Version (bottled 09/04/19) Opaque ebony body topped with an exquisite dense and creamy light tan head; dense and sticky rings of foam descend the glass. Gentle aroma of milk chocolate and vanilla. An immensely pleasing taste of cocoa and bitter chocolate; somewhat nutty; caramel and honey; dully sweet with an undercurrent of bourbon. Heavy, soft and billowy; marshmallow mouthfeel; dense with residual sugar body; smooth velvet; some alcohol warmth. Near perfect visual appeal, a rich yet subtle aroma, and an incredibly balanced and flavorful taste with an unforgettably thick and creamy body -- that sums up this beer. A most heavenly Russian imperial stout. Hell, an exquisite stout no matter what the style!"
5696,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.79,"The gold standard for sours. Dark red, slightly cloudy pour. Lots of bubbles, but low head. Complex, layered flavors of stone fruits (cherries being the most prominent), wine, yeast, citrus tartness. Silky mouthfeel, with a delightful sour bite on the tongue. Aged since Aug 2017. I will pickup a bottle whenever I see it, because it ages so well."
5697,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,99,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.5,"Simply ""wow"" !"
5698,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.51,"Hazy dark orange with a finger of pearl white foam. Other half does it again! Let's start with the body, super hazy, creamy, soft, yet juicy and bright, somehow is elevated by the hops on the finish, amazing. Taste and smell both harvest the juicy tropical fruits and grapefruit fully. Fruit is super ripe in the taste, more just juice in the nose. Leans sweeter but not to the extent of being a focal point. So smooth and delicious, well worth your time"

5702,Matt,99,Strong Ale - American,11.5%,4.01,"Bottle from Jeremy. Ruddy brown pour, soft bubbly head. Woody, malty aroma. Taste also leans on the malt, woody, earthy notes. Finishes Dry. Excellent. update: 2013 vintage bottle thanks to Buckeyeboy. Dark brown and relatively flat. Swwet dark malts, pit fruit, woody, smoky. Taste is rich, sweet and boozy, slippery, and very tasty."
5703,Double Shot,100,Stout - American,7.6%,4.43,"A- 500ml pours into a tulip glass with a tar black body and a deep brown, thick and creamy head. The cap makes it to just over a finger at its peak and has good retention. A few webs of lacing coat the glass. S- Rich coffee and chocolate with that roasty barley edge to round out the richer aromas. Chocolate cake, medium-dark roast coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla sweets and a touch of caramel. T- Again the coffee and the chocolate really run the show here with the coffee taking center stage here a bit more compared to the aroma. Really comes on like a medium roast espresso shot that leads into a chocolate chip brownie and fruity very dark chocolate bars. The roast barley and the grains round things out with a base of dark roast barley, toasted nuts, licorice, toffee and caramel. Again that vanilla sweets hint. A touch of fruit with cherry coming to mind. MF- A luscious and creamy body with a medium-high level of carbonation. Texture is just incredibly smooth and frothy on the palate. Basically a mocha in a glass. Tons of great coffee flavor supported by roast grains and chocolate notes."
5704,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.47,"A: Body is a very orange juice colored body. There wasn't much head or lacing in the beginning. Enough carbonation to keep a small head and a light lacing while drinking. Color is good but head/lacing is lacking.  S: Big fruity smells out of the can. Grapefruit seems to be the predominant smell. Also picking up some oranges and lemons. Very good aromas.  T: The tastes mimick the smell well. However, the oranges seem to overpower the grapefruit.  M: Very soft mouthfeel. Easy drinking beer. The carbonation has a slight tingle/burn feel to it. Flavors of this one hide the booze well.  O: Very good beer. Only thing missing is the head/lacing on the appearance.. Everything else about the beer is top notch."
5705,Pirate Bomb!,100,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.65,"Really really good, super thick coating mouthfeel with tons of chocolate coffee and a little bit of the chili pepper coming in on the finish. The rum barrel was a great idea for this beer. The barrel is very pronounced and compliments the base beer really well. This was a great idea for this beer, I like it better than regular bomb."
5706,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.67,"Bottled 4/20. Poured into teku. Beautiful, glowing orange with some short lasting fizzy head. This was a mild gusher when I opened it, but the carbonation on the pour and the tongue is moderate. Smell is of sour and apricots. Taste is fantastic. Apricots, tartness, and a tiny bit of funk with the aftertaste. Very smooth, and very well done."
5707,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.75,2017 version poured from a 12 oz. can at home. Thanks for the trade Jon! Bourbon and chocolate. Like a bourbon soaked brownie. Exceeded my expectations.
5708,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.0,"Cerveza de color marrón, con una espuma esponjosa de buena retención. Cuerpo medio y carbonatación alta. Aroma a malta, caramelo y vainilla. Sabor dulce con notas de ciruela."
5709,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.35,"Smells like coconut. Tastes like coconut up front, then coffee, then a little more coconut on the back end, all with a nice, roasty porter taste underlying it all. Fantastic. Never had a beer with this low an ABV (6.4%) that had such good adjunct flavor. If I lived in Florida, I would drink this all year."
5710,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.81,"What a beer! Cloudy orange-gold, a nice fluffy white head with staying power. Aroma? Pop the top and experience how the air around you now has a citrus scent. Nice hop intensity, complexity and a loooooong finish. Wish I was celebrating an important event when I had this beer, but then realized that having the beer was an event in itself! Cheers!"
5711,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.78,"""It all goes away"" - 10/23/19 look: 95% black, almost no head smell: intense maple/brown sugar taste: maple, brown sugar, chocolate, coffee, no boozy, no cloying (that surprised me). very pleasant. also both the smell and taste are very complex, kind like it's aged, I think this has something to do with the high abv. feel: this one is heavy, foamy, creamy, dense, sweet caramel finish, wow! overall: this is a little dope thing, I like it a lot, it's above the level of average treehouse stouts (that's a very high compliment)"
5712,Adam From The Wood,99,Old Ale,12%,4.6,"12oz Bottle 2018 Vintage Big, huge, giant thanks to Phil for this beautiful son of a bitch. Adam from the Wood is the darkest of browns, bordering on black. It's much darker than the original. It's also still, like many of the newer HotD special releases. A hard pour produces a couple fleeting bubbles here and there but this puppy is flat. It's worked in past iterations so let's see where it takes us here. The nose is off the charts. I love regular Adam, it's complex and dense. The wood aging puts this one over the top. Old dry leather and tobacco kick it off. A little soy adds umami. Handfuls of prunes and dates and figs. The tobacco is sweet like grandpa's pipe tobacco. What the 3 year barrel aging does is wrap that whole, beautiful complexity in a big giant bear hug of oaken vanilla. It's comforting and rich and elegant and decadent and perfect. This stuff smells absolutely amazing. Nothing can touch that nose. With that said, the flavor ain't none too shabby. That sweet pipe tobacco gets things started and is met with the prunes and dates. They soy is fleeting but there. The leather is old and well worn. Quality cocoa powder lingers on the swallow. Again, all this is surrounded by a rich, luxurious, oily oaken vanilla. There are so many layers of flavor and they're all in such perfect harmony that it's mindblowing. Though this beer is flat I think that bubbles would actually ruin the experience. And an experience it is. This beer is full bodied and plush with a velvety feel. As full bodied as it is, the tannins from the extended aging dry up with finish and leave very little residual stickiness. As robust and decadent as this beer is the alcohol is almost non-existent. It's a sipper but one that gets sipped often. Adam from the Wood is just about as near perfect as you can get. The barrel aging has added amazing qualities to an already amazing beer. This beer is as comfortable as old slippers, as a roaring fire in a winter cabin, as a snifter of cognac on a bearskin rug, old well fingered books, a labrador with your nightly newspaper."
5713,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.27,"I finally got to try this whale after a trade. I thought it was similar to Abraxas. I had a 2017, and may have bunkered it too long with the flavors becoming much more mild than other reviewers indicate.  Honestly, I've had plenty of other better beers within this category that are not on the Top 250 list such as Prison Barrel Aged Wham Whams or some of the Evil Twin or J Wakefield Stouts.  Beer pours black with a caramel color head. Smell of pepper and vanilla, but very subtle. I was expecting a much stronger nose.  Good solid thick mouthfeel similar to chocholate fudge, but no tingling from the peppers. I wanted something stronger and more flavorful."
5714,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),99,Dubbel,8%,4.19,"Bottle from Etre. Solid dark brown in color with great clarity and a frothy off white head that persists and leaves lots of sticky lace. Light skunk aroma when first opened but that dissipated quickly leaving rich toasty bready notes with lots of dark dried fruits. Flavor is rich and decadent yet soft and delicate with an abundance of carbonation that gives a bit of a bubbly mouthfeel; light alcohol presence. Has a medium body with a bit of a drying finish that leaves just a hint of sweet caramelized malt on the palette. Spectacular beer! The 12 gets all the hype, but this one might be even better. Might need some more research on that."
5715,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.46,"Bought at Hazel's in Boulder CO. ~4.5$ for a 12 oz bottle. Bottled 03/04/21, consumed 03/18/21. Awesome label! A&S: Very gorgeous looking beer. Muddy with lively carbonation gold-colored beer, no sediment. White head leaves thick lacing around the glass. The aroma isn't super prominent but is still quite enjoyable. The aroma contains oranges, floral hops, T&M: East coast IPA. Super JUICY upfront! Mangos, grapefruits, oranges, melon. Maybe a touch on the sweet side in the mid-taste. The back end of the beer gives you a solid hop punch and contains grassy and resiny hops. Very mouth-watering. The body has a medium crispness and very refreshing. Slightly chewy. Overall: Very impressed. I am regretting that I didn't buy a 4-pack, but I am glad I took a shot without knowing much about them, this beer was great! Looking forward to trying the other 2 beers from them I picked up."
5716,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.16,"500ml bottle poured into a snifter. Black, small light brown head which quickly fully diminishes The nose has strong barrel, vanilla, and bourbon which play well together, with a touch of anise. The flavor is dominated by bourbon, to the point of being unbalanced. Vanilla and anise kick in as secondary flavors. The feel is thinner then your typical Bottle Logic Static beer, but it is still medium body. There is a good amount of heat ( no surprise at 18% ). It has a creamy feel to it. Even with its bourbon dominance, I still really like the beer. I think it does all come together in a nice way, provided you like the bourbon flavor."
5717,Black & Wild,99,Wild Ale,10%,4.65,Was lucky enough to have this one at the source! Enjoyed at Side Project Taproom with friends and this is one amazing Wild! Very complex and fruity!

5719,Marshmallow Handjee,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,15%,4.92,"2017 vintage; drank 6/2/17 @ Harvest Hop Haus.  Bottle 538 of 1227.  Black appearance.  Minimal dark tan head; minimal lace.  Rich vanilla, milk chocolate, oak & mild bourbon notes in the nose.  Thick, sticky mouthfeel.  BOLD, rich vanilla & milk chocolate flavors up front; mild oak & faint bourbon heat notes on the finish.  A vanilla lovers dream, and possibly the best ""pastry stout"" ever made."
5720,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.5,Brown reddish color. Stains the glass a bit. Get charred oak and bourbon followed by cherry tartness and finishing with just a bit of coffee. Excellent beer. Very complex.

5722,Abrasive Ale,100,IPA - Imperial,9.2%,4.58,Bitterness and sweet hoppy citrus all wrapped up in this intense hop bomb. Rarely do you find this amount of bitterness balanced out with the oatmeal malt characteristics yet still drinks like one of the most impressive IPA’s. Bitter lovers enjoy!
5723,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.26,"Oil slick of burgundy, copper and shiny yet muddy brown with a soft fizzy film that can be coaxed into reappearing and coating the glass with the legs of the booze before quickly receding again. I smell a crap ton of pretty potent, mossy wood, almost peaty. This woodiness is, unfortunately, largely succeeding in tamping down other elements that shyly present themselves as toasted nuts, raisin, prune, fig, apple butter, and bourbon. Oh my god. Divine. Taste is nothing like the nose. Silky smooth, really rich fig comes first--this feels like a gift from the gods. Elements from the nose, such as the overwhelming woodiness, are subdued nicely, with a little charred tobacco and leather coming in, followed by decadent caramel, luxurious dark cherries and brown sugar. Despite the very high ABV, BB4D is soft, round, and goes down easily, finishing faintly dry. The booze is only barely there and very well integrated. Are my ears red yet?"
5724,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,99,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.34,"Cloudy but not quite a milkshake. Gold to amber color. Lasting head with a blanket of lace left on the glass.  Strong weedy, grassy aroma. Some pineapple and grapefruit as well.  Juicy, slightly sour pale malt start. Relatively thin bodied with an elevated carbonation level. The biting hop is closest to fresh ground pepper. Moderate aftertaste which isn't overly bitter. Well-balanced with a moderate level of complexity."
5725,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.21,"A: Thick black pour with elusive mocha-brown highlights, and a head with minimal characteristics: formation, retention, lacing S: Molasses, liquorice, bourbon-drenched dark fruit concentrations with a vinous touch: An aroma of depth given the array of milk chocolate, oaked nutty malts, cocoa powder, caramel swirl, burned char, leather, subdued coconut  T: Lots of minute workings to become deep-rooted in: the silky sharp chocolate, tricky layers of dark fruit, smoky tobacco, rich caramel, singed toffee, roasted walnuts, baked vanilla espresso, a touch of maple fudge M: Moderately sticky and semi cloying with distant carbonation. It’s fairly roast-y and sweet with a delicate peppery kick O: A well balanced and blended vintage that aged with poise spitting out more prunes, raisins, dates, and figs as it progressed with a bit of tannin spiced/peppery herbs, ashtray/charred wood, and hints of brownie stuffed graham crackers. Aroma from the empty bottle was pure maple syrup with tracings of prunes, figs, and tannin foregrounds before fading into the ether"
5726,Pirate Paradise,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.5,L: Pitch black with almost no head.
5727,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.31,"(16 oz can, 06/09/21; gifted a single... poured into a fat tulip) L: beautiful, thick, dense, crusty foam atop an opaque, moonlight yellow liquid... excellent head retention; several rings of crystalline lace S: pithy citrus w/ floral undertone... delicate musky tone slowly creeps out, even a bit of honeyed cereal grain... nice (maybe too) subdued yet layered array of aromas... herbal and marginally earthy-minty tone emerges to the fore T: floral static, subtly gin-like herbal melange... notably dry aftertaste with a soft doughy note lingering on the sides of the palate in the cheeks... vague bubblegum hum after a few sips, obscured within the (again, dry) tropical candy powder fog... the alcohol is apparent, buried in the background, certainly affecting a burst in expressiveness about 1/3 through the volume... the booze-bitter interplay shapes a herbal accent over say capsicum heat or spicy spice... a pool of static; latent grapefruit milk F: fortified, attenuated nectar; a sheet of resins and oils, lifted... quietly luscious and seductive O: hmm... an ascent to the stars... a standout among the relatively few NEIPAs I've tasted... this is more to my flavor preferences, as in like a NEIPA-WCIPA-kellerbier hybrid(?)... The first of I hope several ventures into the world of Other Half (1822)"
5728,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,4.46,On tap:
5729,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.45,"16 oz. can into a pint glass with a hazy orange/gold color, 1/2 inch white head and minimal lacing. Smells of honey, tropical fruits, citrus and floral hops. Taste follows aroma with notes of oily/piney hop resin, tropical/citrus fruits and honey sweet malt balanced by the bitter hops. Medium to full body with decent carbonation and slightly bitter finish. Overall, a very good IPA with a slight balance towards the bitter hops. A great beer."
5730,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.71,"Black pour at 55 degrees with no ruby edges; quick cap of fizzy bubbles. Aroma of apple cider; brandy liqueur retro nasal. Apple jack, red wine, semi sweet malt base; some chocolate; green apples finish. Medium body, moderate carbonation; very light warmth despite 12% ABV. World class, so we’ll balanced and so dangerous; brandy/barrel notes are off-set by gobs of ripe apples from nose to sip through the finish; impressive!"
5731,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.44,"Pours a bright golden yellow, semi hazy with a billowy bright white head. Nose is wine like. Grape must, grains and fresh sawed wood (oak) Taste of grape skins up front. Tartness comes through in the form of the skins. Some light lemon zest, grasses and grains follow. A smooth oak wine barrel finish to it. Much like a white wine. Mouthfeel is medium to light at times. This beer finishes very dry and I mean very! It leaves you definitely searching for the next sip. Drank this at 10 months from bottle date. Have another one I am letting go a few years and I will report back."
5732,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.73,"On tap for TBBW 2021 “Sorta Rad” Event. 2021 vintage. Good viscosity; not as thick as a lot of Angry Chair I’ve had. Getting awesome Samoa vibes. Strong coconut and chocolate, with a really well-balanced barrel. Awesome."
5733,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.69,"Pours hazy and orange like a New England IPA.  The beer showcases SARA's signature saison softness on the palate, with great flavor and acidity, mild funk, and a burst of fruit flavor on the finish.  One of SARA's finest works. This is unequivocally better than West Ashley"
5734,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.69,"25 cLass bottle poured into a wine taster. 2006 bottle. Appearance - Viscous black. Small khaki head. Very thin collar. Smell - Wow. Very oaky. Deep dark chocolate. Roasty coffee. A little bit of smoke. A green woody aroma. Almost like cedar. Taste - Incredible. Intense roasted malt. Coffee. Bitter chocolate. Smokey flavor. Licorice. A little bit sweet. Sherry. Woody. It's not really oak, again more of a cedar. But not quite. Mouthfeel - Medium low carbonation. Exceptionally smooth and easy to drink.  Overall - This got more complex and enjoyable as it warmed. Unbelievable beer."
5735,DFPF,99,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.5%,4.34,"On tap at Fidelity festival, Dublin. "
5736,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.51,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours black and night, with very little dark head. The coffee is dominant on the nose. Chocolate, maple, vanilla, fudge, roasted malts. Taste is super intense. Lots of roasted malts, burnt wood, coffee grounds, vanilla, and chocolate. A nice bourbon backbone is throughout. The alcohol is definitely prominent - a slight bourbon aftertaste. Mouthfeel is actually a bit thin - not as creamy as expected. Overall, amazing."
5737,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.03,"Batch 2 - 375ml bottle - poured into a zin stem at 45°F. Pours a deep blackberry purple - foggy anf crimson when held to the light, with a lasting sudsy pinkish collar. The occasional rising bubble can be seen. Not as saturated, but quite similar to a merlot in appearance.  Nose: Really wonderful blackberry presence here. That classic, instantly recognisable Side Project grist and culture character forms a simple foundation, with some toasty grain, bright acidity, and white oak, with subtle threads of hay, wheat, dusty leather, stone, petrichor, wet leaves, and lemon. The fruit is fresh, vibrant, and seedy, with an underlying jammy element. Reserved, but elegant.  Palate: Thicket greets the palate with a sharp zing of acidity, with a ton of lacto-driven lemon juice pucker, and a bit of acetic bite following. Like many fruited Side Project wilds, there's an underlying sweetness that seems like it's from both the malt as well as some fructose. The sweetness tuns parallel to, but beneath the sourness, taming it a bit. The blackberry character is unmistakable, buy leans towards the dry, seedy, unripe, tart end of the spectrum, rather than juicy or saturated. The acidity is aggressive, and thankfully, burns fast and bright, settling down quickly, and revealing some grains and a bit of oak. Some ripe berry pokes through, along with some wine-soaked oak, finishing quick, clean, and dry.  Mouthfeel/Body: Thicket is medium-light in body, wispy, fluid, and crisp. Puckering acidity up front causes some mouthwatering. Effervescence is fine, lively, amd sparkly. The finish is dry, with some very subtle oak tannins.  Overall: This is one of those wild ales that could have been stellar if it wasn't so acidic. The reviews are polarising - some saying it's jammy, others, that it's crazy sour. As it warms, some ripe berry sweetness does begin to emerge, which helps a lot, and it does become enjoyable, but the aggressive acidity holds it back and stifles the complexity. It's certainly fruit-forward, and very much Side Project, but it isn't the most balanced or complex offering. This one is good, but not amazing."
5738,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.62,"The beer pours a Pitch Black with a thin khaki head that recedes quickly. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of toasted coconut, chocolate syrup, and walnuts. It tastes of toasted coconut, chocolate syrup, and walnuts. It has a medium full body, but very smooth. Lots of coconut as advertised, did not lose a step after 6 monthes."
5739,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.19,"Drank 03.24.20 out of a tulip, bottle dated 2016 or 2017, properly cellared.  Hate to say I was slightly underwhelmed. A nice looking beer with a nice feel, not at think as I've come to expect from FB, but still good. Did get a nice coconut smell and taste but think the time on the bottle probably muted both of those a bit. The thing I didn't like as much was the roasty taste, which I guess might be the porter part, but could also be some darker coffee roasts. And no hint of alcohol or barrel at all - this would have help for me. So be it, my opinion. I'd like to try a fresher bottle, but given the cost, probably only if I'm gifted it some day...fat chance at that! Cheers!"
5740,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,3.96,Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of tart notes with some oak and Brett with light vinous notes is quite enticing. Taste is a great mix of tart notes with some oak and Brett notes with light vinous notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Very enjoyable saison but maybe not as complex as I had expected.
5741,Breakfast Stout,100,Stout - Oatmeal,8.3%,3.84,"Definitely has a raisin type smell. The flavor follows suit but you can distinguish the chocolate initially and the coffee on the backend. I like this beer but it’s not as complex as some of the other Founders which some may appreciate but I for one enjoy the mirage of flavors. Not a bad beer, just simple. Maybe if I had tried this before I tried so many of the other breakfast stout variants, I would have a different opinion."

5743,Hopslam Ale,99,IPA - Imperial,10%,4.67,Enjoyed on tap at Flying Saucer which is Memphis TN. 
5744,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.56,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Sante Adairius snifter glass. Acquired in a trade.  Pours a sunshine-golden, hazy body with a big fluffy white three finger head that reduces slowly to leave nice lacing and good retention.  Aromas are funky, yeasty, barnyard and heavy acidic citrus, oak and champagne sitting on a light malty backbone. This smells heavenly! On the tongue is light lactic / citrus tartness upfront, followed by oak and wheaty barnyard, green apple and white wine. Finishes dry and lightly bitter. Stunningly drinkable, a great quencher for a warm day. Medium carbonation and medium light body.  A very well done Saison - extreme balance and flavor."

S-sour, acidic, passion fruit, tropical T-flavors linger really nicely, passion fruit and dragon fruit so potent! medium tartness F-very drinkable, juicy, pretty tart O-a great beer. I've really enjoyed their stuff and I would love to side-by-side DFPF and MM"
5747,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.44,"Apparently, I have never reviewed Second Fiddle. That's weird to me, because I first had it probably seven years ago when I first visited Fiddlehead and they had tapped it just before I had arrived. Of course it was fantastic then, living up to my expectations in every possible way, but every time I've had it since then... I must say I've been kinda let down. This batch, however, is from 5/14/21, and is definitely the highest-quality canned batch I've had! It easily eclipses every prior SF iteration I've consumed, and thus I believe it is a fitting entry for a review. The pour is, honestly, way clearer than I remember. I don't think SF has ever been a super hazy beer, but this is like 90+% clear, building up a decent head of bone-white foam with a chunkiness that stands in rather stark contrast to the clear golden beer below. It leaves behind a fantastic and consistent trail of lace around the entire glass, and the legs themselves are pretty nice as well. Body is like a light orange/caramel color with plenty of suspended solids if held up to direct light, meaning it's definitely been centrifuged... still not completely ""clear"" but not quite hazy/doughy NEIPA realm stuff either. This looks just great. The nose has this insane deep pine-cone like scent that just smacks of ""old-school IPA"" but also contains lots of fun, fruity esters as well. Mango and tangerine with hints of guava combine with West Coast pine and grapefruit funkiness... it just jives super well. This is definitely the best and most cohesive batch of this beer that I have personally had since they started canning it. It's bringing me back totally to the first time I tried it! Lemony notes and subtle tropical fruit elements coming out as it warms... so glad I got another can. Noticed the different art/design for the can and wondered if maybe it brought with it a change in recipe or some kind of refinement. Not 100% sure but feels that way to me so far! Flavor is super clean pine with biscuity malt bringing up the backend, bolstered by superb undertones of mango, guava, and passion fruit alongside some hints of tangerine/tangelo and herbal grassiness. Man, this is drinking so great right now! I'm sure it being 11 days old has more than a little to do with it, but I am re-impressed by this brew! Had a few ""meh"" experiences with it over the years since, but this is giving me the feeling that they know exactly what they're doing and what may be necessary to bring this brew into the modern realm. Love that it doesn't seem like they gave in to trends and made it a hazy DIPA. It's just a superbly crafted, pine-y, citrusy, slightly-tropical IPA from New England, trends be damned!! Hoping to keep tracking this one down over time to see that they keep the quality intact..."
5748,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,99,Lambic - Gueuze,7.5%,4.67,"2014 vintage; drank 6/22/19 @ Golgi Apparatus.  A delightful, fruity, balanced geueze that showcases the brewer's art to the nth degree. Had this in a share with a lot of heavy hitters, and it was my favorite. Can't wait to have another..."
5749,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,2.77,"Tonight I am re-visiting The Abyss, a beer I wasn't too impressed with at my first and second whack. This one is a 2018, into a Tallgrass snifter.  Pours a really lovely thick and creamy dark black with a creamy cap of 1 finger, receding to a thick bubbly ring with bubbles on top. Sparse lacing graces the sides.  Aroma is huge and welcoming. A lot of chocolate with a lot of musty oak barrel. Some hints of port wine, cinnamon, raspberry, and molasses.  Flavor is exactly like I remember it - an overhopped disgusting mess. Piney-bitter to start, then graduates to grassy-bitter, with heavy ethanol and some undertones of roasted malt, oats, and molasses. The ""undertones"" part is important, because they are completely overshadowed by grass and pine. This is the grassiest ""stout"" I've ever had in my life. I get a little bit of caramel peeking through too but it's so faint compared to the bitterness. More grass and pine on the finish. Tastes like a QB sack. Feel is resiny, oily, creamy, and very hot.  How this gets a 99 is beyond me. This is a fucking awful beer. Palate exhaustion after the 3rd sip. An F-, would never ever visit again. I mean, there's a couple redeeming qualities like the look and aroma, but when it falls apart on the tongue, what am I supposed to do? This bomber is going straight to the drain, R.I.P.  ---------------------------------------"
5750,Aurelian Lure,99,Wild Ale,5.4%,4.5,"Blend 4. I'm continually amazed by how much fruit falls off of sours when aged for some time. I recently enjoyed a Fen Tao and the peach notes were tremendous. Since then, I've drank a Nocturn Chrysalis and an Aurelian Lure - neither have had a comparable presence of fruit, after two years of aging. I'm surprised, for some reason. All beers age differently, but it seems consistent that fruit notes fall off a bit. Aurelian Lure thus doesn't have much apricot presence left. It's dominated now by sour, tart barrel notes. It's also very acidic. Damn sour, damn tart, and very good - but my acidic reflux was unpleasant after this beer. Be prepared accordingly."
5751,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.7,"Lou Pepe Kriek 14 from bottle, at Cantillon Brewery in Brussels, Belgium. A deep clear, red appearance with abundant amount of light foam upon pour. Smell has an abundance of strong cherry aroma combined with some well balanced barnyard funk and wheat smell. Very complex taste. Some 'farm' flavors such as light cheese and wheat and big cherry flavors (but not overly sweet). Smooth aftertaste and sipper for sure."
5752,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.35,"Simplistic beauty is how I would describe this beer. The sour, funk, grain and sweet notes all are perfectly balanced with one another. Smell is oak sour with slight yeast funk, with accents of orange, lemon, vanilla, faint white wine, and caramel apple. Taste is taking all of the elements of the smell and putting them through an oaken filter, causing a delicate blend of flavor. Wish there was a little more potency there. Acidic sourness defines the finish."

5754,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.36,"This review is for batch 2.  L- Similar to most stouts. Dark brown to black with a mocha head. Started around a finger on the initial pour, faded to a thin ring that lingered. Medium-thin pour.  S- Blend of dark and milk chocolate. Some molasses and chili. Every now and then, I get a little bit of green apple from the brandy.  T- Kind of weird (not saying that's bad). It's mostly chocolate (mix of milk and dark like the smell) with some chili heat on the finish. Every now and then, I get hints of dark sugars and a bit of green apple.  F- Medium feel. A little booze burn. Could be thicker and richer.  O- It's good, but I wouldn't put it near it's ranking. It makes me wonder how awesome batch 1 was, not that I'm ever going to get to try it. It's definitely worth a try if you're into pepper stouts."
5755,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,13%,4.38,"Picked up a bottle of this at Julio's. Shared with JLindros. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark brown almost black with a thin mocha head that faded quickly. Nice legs. S - Aromas of massive vanilla beans galore, raw vanilla as well. Super rich. Light coffee aroma, coffee ice cream like with some light bourbon cream notes as well. T - Taste is similar to the nose. Creme broulee galore. Little burnt toffee flavour as well with nice burnt caramel. There is very nice coffee taste as well. The bourbon is rather subtle but everything else is excellent. M - Mouthfeel is lowly carbonated, creamy, alcohol hidden nicely. O - Overall this was a very nice beer with loads of vanilla. The barrel was really light though. Serving Type: bottle"
5756,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.03,Pours a Pitch black no head or lacing. 4 oz pour. Apple brandy aroma. Very mild roasting. More roasting on taste. Heavy on the brandy. Apple on the end. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
5757,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.52,"A big thanks to supercolter to opening this last night. I had poor luck with getting an intact growler. A- Pours a deep black with little carbonation. S- The base beer is present with notes of dark chocolate, chili, cinnamon, vanilla, brown sugar and roasted malt. Caramelized apples and notes of brandy also present. T- Taste follows suite with caramel dipped apples, dark chocolate, spicy chili's, cinnamon, vanilla beans, roasted malt, oak and a bit of heat from the brandy. M- Practically no carbonation with a thick syrupy body. A small amount of heat from the chili's and abv at the end. O- Was very impressed how the Apple Brandy barrels complimented the base beer. The best Cigar City offering I've had. Wish there was a bit of carbonation, but overall, a fantastic spiced stout and something I've been looking to try for a long time.  Thanks again, Jeff!"
5758,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.42,"Canned on 8/5/20. Poured into a gravity pint glass, despite the recommendationsl to drink from the can. Pours a dank pineapple color, with a light head. Stong notes of guava with flavors of mango and papaya. A hoppy beer but with limited bitterness. I beleive it would pair nicely with pork chops."
5759,Very GGGreennn,100,IPA - New England,8.3%,4.49,"Canned 1/5/21, “In this house we do not slander Marcus Smart! “ stamped on the bottom of the can Well, we have a pretty special TH beer here tonight. Currently the 8th highest rated NEIPA and the 35th highest rated beer of all time. Sure, they have beers that rank higher, but I’m still very excited for this one. This is also the last beer in the Green lineage that I have yet to try Pours a hazy pale orange with 2 fingers of soapy white head that slowly reduces to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing The aroma here is sweet and tropical, bringing forth notes of creamy melon, nectarine, papaya, tart tangerine, soft doughy malt, and dank earthy hops The taste has a bit more to offer in terms of bitter hops, but it is still tropical and fruity at its core. On the front end of the palate I get resinous piney hops, juicy orange, tart mango, and sweet cantaloupe. The swallow brings notes of chalky malt, pithy grapefruit, papaya, and sweet peach A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation to make a very creamy smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry without too much lingering sweetness Another great NEIPA from Tree House, wonderfully balanced in taste. I’ve had better from them, but this was damn good and I’d certainly seek it out again"
5760,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.9%,4.35,"Happy Halloween. I bought this a while ago in a bottle shop when it was too hot to enjoy a big barrel aged stout so now's the time. Poured a 12.7 ounce bottle into a DFH tulip and the head just didn't measure up over a blackish brown body so it gets nicked for that. Smell is of a generic brand Jackie O's stout, which is a pretty high standard but they have a certain sameness to them albeit on a high plane (I hope this is making sense to someone who's experienced this). They loaded this up with Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee (which coffee wise is out of my not cheap range) so it's present in the smell and taste but not to an obnoxious degree; instead things are nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is just fine for a barrel aged stout. This has been a good experience despite my lower than average scoring."
5761,Focal Banger,100,IPA - New England,7%,3.71,"Shared can at regional tasting. Slightly hazy yellow colour, white head. Decent fruity aroma. Decent fruity flavour too, solid bitterness. Might well sample again."
5762,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.51,"Bottom of can: 2/19/19 Straw golden color with slight amber hues. A fluffly and bubbly white foam keeps it high. Light coverage, displaying sticky lace. Mosiac hop has to be one of the most diverse hops in every way. The aroma is of sweet tropical fruits, pineapple, citrus and melons. The malt is a light, crispy grain and a smooth creamy style smell, very light and golden aromatics. Big time nose. The tropical fruity hop complexity from the Mosiac is pretty high grade. The hop flavor rolls on and on with multiple layers. A sharp earthy, dry texture kicks in, peppery pineapple a dry citrus tones soon roll in. Oranges with black pepper and dry crispy pilsner style malt all mingle together for a bit until it all finishes dry and hearty. A milky, smoothness happens within the malty feel and flavor that lingers on as creamy, and then more orange citrus tones come back. Like I said, complex, with layers.  The dry hopped Mosiac approach makes for a seriously deep hoppy groove in both mouthfeel and flavor. The aftertaste of fresh, dry hops keeps going long after the last sip. Obviously complexity is vety high concidering the quality and balance of malt/hops. The ale yeast is always very neautral and clean, which allows the hops to shine and malt to hold it all down. You would never know this is 8.5% abv. Because of the heady complexity and dry tones. The alcohol only adds further depth to an already heady brew."
5763,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.52,"750ml bottle, 2017 release, poured into a stemless wine glass. Enjoyed on 12.10.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a jet black color, crazy thick and super viscous with a thick finger of head, low retention with a few spots of lace. The aroma is nice, tons of fudge, light heat, tons of cinnamon, smooth barrel, light char, mild vanilla and a really nice rich grain aroma. The flavors are excellent, tons of cinnamon, crazy thick fudge, super rich and decadent with ample bourbon barrel offering some caramel and charred oak, a nice vanilla presence with rich grains, stone fruits and a nice hint of vanilla as well. The mouthfeel is perfect, coating, thick full body, creamy and incredibly smooth with a warm and lightly spicy finish. Verdict: A world class rendition of Hunahpu from Cigar City. Insane depth to this beer, tons of complex flavors that super balanced and expressed so well and the mouthfeel and body really take this to new heights. Just a delicious beer."
5764,Darkstar November,99,Stout - Russian Imperial,14.76%,4.5,The molasses in this beer adds some leveled sweetness and complexity to an already superb mouthfeel. Great depth and a delicious beer that many don’t give proper due.
5765,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,3.99,Thanks to Mr. Beer_Economicus for this Charlotte beauty.
5766,Clare's Thirsty Ale,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.5%,4.52,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is slightly sweet raspberry. Taste is very smooth pleasant slightly sweet raspberry.
5767,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,3.85,"Nice, but not world class. Canned on 3/23/21 so maybe more fresh is better?  I was expecting Heady Topper level hoppy goodness, but it lacks the complexity and balance."
5768,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.39,"L - 1-finger offwhite head atop a glimmering orange juice body. S - tropical fruit, honey. Very inviting. T - grapefruit, melon, tangerine, with just a hint of honey sweetness. Earthy middle. Moderate bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness. F - medium-full, creamy body with lower than normal carb. O - I was worried this would be too sweet, but it’s perfectly balanced and a joy to drink."
5769,Art,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.48,"wow--- what a funky nose---apple meets barnyard funkiness... however, the flavor is a little more restrained and not quite up to the nose... a seriously delicious BA saison, but I have to agree with another reviewer, its no le sarrasin!... next up is Ann so ill have to see how it matches up.... life is rough!"
5770,Supplication,100,Wild Ale,7.75%,4.5,Poured from a cork'n'cage 375 mL bottle. Batch 090216 L: Nearly clear golden burgundy pour. Thick foamy white head leaves great lacing. Some haze and sediment on the 2nd pour. S: Tart cherry and funk. Oak and red wine. T.F: Tart without being sour. Baking cherry... funk and bacterial flora. Oak and red wine. Dry with the wisp of some residual fruity sweetness. Moderately acidic... tanins and grape. Medium bodied... surprisingly smooth and creamy on the tongue. Balanced... more cherry and red wine at the finish. O: Absolutely outstanding beer. Loads of flavor... super drinkable... and tart but approachable. Russian River has their reputation for a reason.
5771,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,6.5%,4.71,"Really outstanding all around stout. Thick and creamy feel, delicious coffee and mildly sweet chocolate. Big nose and long finish. Drinks much bigger than the abv."
5772,Upper Case,100,IPA - New England,9%,4.41,"Had on tap at the Trillium beer garden on the Greenway. Nice, full aromas and flavors that lean towards the fruity pungency of Galaxy and Mosaic. At 9% ABV and $20/4-pack of 16oz cans, this is Trillium's 'best value' DIPA.  89/100 EDIT (7/23/18):"
5773,Juice Machine,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.03,"Poured from 16oz tall can into a tulip. Appearance: super hazy medium-yellow hue. I think every Tree House beer I've had more or less looks the same; it's a solid example of what the style should look like. Smell: I get a lot of apricot and kind of a woody earthiness. An interesting flavor; I kinda like it. Taste: very earthy, with a stone fruit character. Kind of juicy in a nectary way, but again, very earthy. A tasty beer, although perhaps not as enticing as some other TH beers I've had. Mouthfeel: medium body with a good carbonation and rather a good creaminess. I quite like it. Overall: this beer is growing on me as I drink it; a bit of a citrus note comes out. I would still say, though, that while this is a good beer, it is among my least favorite TH beers."
5774,Abner,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.63,"A: proper hazy yellow with slight opaqueness S: citrusy with a slight sweetness which is the only telling of the malt  T: juicy on the front of your tongue with slight stone fruit, while the hop bitterness shines through at the same time. Perfect meld of old school and new age hop usage.  M: Properly crisp and smooth, but like a lot of HF I get a phlegmy feel which keeps the flavor and I love for beers like this  O: This is an exceptional beer that makes me disappointed I have to drink other NE IPAs that are not Hill Farmstead. I would gladly drink this daily. This actually got better when paired with food too."
5775,The Abyss,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.4%,4.93,12 Oz bottle. Bottled 4/11/2020 Yeah it's less then a month old...but it being the year 2020 I've decide to sample some as well as cellar some. There are no guarantees these day... Pours a solid black body with a tan head. Moderate retention. Several rings of lacing. Wow there's a lot going on here ! Fresh cherry scent hit me at the pour but the overall scent is quite complex. There's a very roasted/burnt coffee thing throughout. As well as an oak scent (like a good cabernet sauvignon.) The cherries are still there as well as sweet and semi chocolate notes.  Taste follows but the booze comes out a little more. The cherries are still prominent but the roasted quality is a bit more toned down. Full and velvety feel Value/price point (does not effect score) At $18.79 for a 4 pack it's a little pricey but the complexity makes it hard to resist.  Pretty impressive. So much going on here... Perfect for sipping on a cold night.
5776,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),99,Stout - American Imperial,11.9%,4.94,"2015 bottle. Wow, amazing nose fudgey, very smooth. Thick just enough on the mouthfeel. Not boozy at all. Not too thick but looks nice and dark. Smells like classic Eclipse"

5778,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.31,"Slightly overrated (especially for what it costs!), but it's still a fantastic beer. I actually found Duck Duck Gooze to be vastly superior to this one."
5779,Swish,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.17,"Poured from a can (29Apr2020) into a Teku L: very turbid, slightly creamy orange yellow. Pretty thick white head, can make out some bubbles through the haze slowly rising to the surface S: rich, sharp overripe citrus and tropical fruit. Mango, passionfruit, pineapple, papaya, with a bitter orange/grapefruit note in the background. Not as much of a nose bomb as I expected T: a great, if par for the course, tropical and citrus fruit flavor following the nose. Some nice bitterness toward the end, especially with the medium/long finish F: medium body, medium carbonation, slightly drying, very drinkable O: a very good IPA that fell short of expectations given the hype. Perhaps a matter of it being a month old (hate using that excuse but it proves true sometimes!). Would want to try again, at the moment a solid NEIPA I can’t help but ding due to it’s whale status"
5780,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.27,"Poured into a 16 oz Nordic pint glass canned on 5/19/21. Pours a hazy yellow with a half finger sticky white head that leaves thin streaks of lace with nice retention. 4.5 Aroma is papaya, mandarin, slightly dank marijuana, peach, and apricot. 4.25 Taste follows mandarin, papaya, marijuana, peach, and apricot really well balanced. 4.25 Mouthfeel is above medium, a tad sticky but not dry, soft gentle carbonation, and at 8.5% really easy going down. 4.25 Overall this is a really nice NEDIPA, but honestly I was expecting even more. I think this brewery at one point put out some of the best NEDIPAs I have ever had and this one is just good. Thanks @jzeilinger. 4.25"
5781,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.33,"Tons of dark chocolate and bourbon in the nose. Also a little vanilla, leather, and faint coffee. The taste starts off with more of the big chewy chocolate, accompanied by some nice bourbon heat. Unfortunately around mid-palate, there is a noticeable drop-off in the flavor profile. Subtle notes of vanilla and oak can be found, but the overall complexity (or lack thereof) keeps this just outside elite status in my opinion. Although the heavy fudgy chocolate on the front end gives a nice impression of viscous creaminess, it seems to finish a bit thin for the style. I will say I was quite impressed by the abundance of bourbon character, without feeling boozy or overwhelming. Overall, it's very very good, and I'd happily drink another."
5782,Black Tuesday,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.5%,4.62,"Pours an inky black with glimmers of brown cola, scant head but surprising carbonation. Aroma is bursting with dark cacao supported by bourbon caramel, espresso, oak & anise.  Not surprisingly, the barrel characteristics really dominate the palate - tons of boozey caramel & vanilla upfront, some fudge bark & burnt chocolate after that. On the backend there is definitely a sharp anise / black licorice flavor that helps counter some of that sweetness. Finishes with more bourbon heat & bitter anise.  Thought it was a little bit thin, and a tad too hot on the booze (but I mean, for a 19% beer whadda ya expect?) but I liked that it wasn’t just a sweet bomb and had some earthier notes."
5783,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,3.41,"Undrinkable due to the acidity. Had higher hopes for this one but it was a drain pour for me. Maybe a bad bottle, but see others with similar comments."
5784,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.49,Very light gold in color. White head.  A very nice saison beer. Oaky and fruity. Herbal. Lemony. Tropical fruit blend. Earthy. Spice notes. Light tartness. Light bodied. Very easy to drinking. This is well done. Wow!
5785,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.16,"Not a gueuze guy, I rate this below Lou Pepe's average. "
5786,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.84,"The best beer of 2018 so far. Bottle from Mikkeller NYC. Nose is pure farmhouse w/ some acidity, apple, pear, and wet leather. The taste is perfect. There is subtle tart w/ funk and earth from the yeast and grains. The blend is perfect. The feel is amazing, a little heavier then the typical tart saison but goes w/ this offering perfectly. Well worth actively seeking out if you are a fan of saison or sour beer."
5787,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.49,"Pours a reddish brown with low, wispy head. Smell is sour with notes of rowan-berries, currants, citrus and a hint of juniper and Seville oranges. Taste is properly sour and intense with notes of cherries, sloe, currants, red wine and some grass and citrus. Dry and complex finish. Mouthfeel is medium, dry and well carbonated. Overall, a superb sour, complex and powerful."
5788,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.74,"Bottle thanks to Brian Look: Pours Jet black with a good brown head and lots of retention Smell: Chocolate, sweet, and molasses Taste: Well, this is fantastic with sweetness and strawberry and rich barrel.  Feel: Very thick and viscous mouthfeel. This coats the mouth and lingers Overall: Fantastic beer culmination from two great breweries one of my favorites stouts in quite a while"
5789,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.18,1 pint can
5790,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.86,"My buddy had been begging me to try this saying it is the best brewed beer in Ohio. We have similar tastes in IPAs so I decided to give it a try. It was a 22 ounce draft. The look is a nice dark golden color. The aroma is a nice blend of citrus and pine hops. The taste is the same. These balance of flavors mask the 8.3% alcohol content. Definitely can drink this down pretty quick and get a nice buzz. The beer is super smooth and has a nice dry finish. Definitely having it again at some point. Very, very impressed. May be Ohio's best IPA."
5791,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.52,L - beautiful cloudy peach colored 
5792,La Fosse,99,Wild Ale,8%,4.83,"I had this right after having Fuzzy at the tasting room in St. Louis and they are neck and neck. I may actually prefer La Fosse, because the apricots have a more unique aroma and tartness that set it apart from Fuzzy more significantly than anticipated."
5793,Double Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.5,"Had poured from pint can, bottom stamped ""CANNED ON: 07/23/20,"" gift from friend, into nonic pint. Pours a beautiful slightly cloudy orange-gold, with a lasting 1- to 2-finger head, leaving elegant lace. Aroma is huge juicy citrus and tropical fruit, which gives way to a continuing not quite dank herbaceousness, not found in Sip of Sunshine. On drinking, it is all about the juicy citrus and tropical fruit, balanced with a bit of malt and hop bite, and further distinguished from Sip of Sunshine by alcohol sweetness in the finish."
5794,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),100,Stout - American Imperial,11.3%,4.68,"A somewhat classic from Founders, this big brother of KBS it’s a lot more. A LOT. And that tells you something ass KBS itself is also a good beer- still, it doesn’t come close to this: Lots of coffee, choco w/nice mouthfeel to it."
5795,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,99,Lambic - Gueuze,6.5%,4.4,"Season 17/18 Luminescent, slight golden-orange haze. Lovely one-knuckle rocky, foam head. Spicy oak, lemon and orange rind, some faint vanilla and grass. Tart to bitter, drying and fizzy on the palate. Definitely worth a try, very refreshing"
5796,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.77,"Consumed 5 months after the bottling date. Pours jet black with dark tan/light brown head about 1.5 fingers high of decently long persistence. No lacing. Smells as advertised: chocolate plus coffee, plus a background of dark roasted grains. Taste follows the smell. Nice, heavy body with light to moderate fine carbonation in the mouthfeel. No overt feel of all that ABV. In fact, not a lot of presence of that bourbon barrel aging taste or feel, but overall very nice. I do have an issue paying $5/12 oz when there are nearly equally pleasant stouts for at least a dollar per bottle less."
5797,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.74,Wasn’t expecting the haze but after I got past that everything about this beer was solid.
5798,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.53,"Outstanding imperial stout. Thick, motor oil pour and feel, coffee is heavy on the nose, and similarly is the most present of the adjuncts. It feels more like it's own beer than an Abraxas variant, as most of the cinnamon and pepper is subdued by the coffee. Not a bad thing, just different than what I expected."
5799,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,99,Porter - Imperial,13.1%,4.51,12.7 FL. OZ. bottle
5800,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.53,"Pours a dark raisin brown. Raisins and salted nuts on the nose. It's incredibly smooth. There's alcohol there, but not in a hot way. Lots of dried fruit and nuts. Getting raisins and prunes, as well as some almonds. The high alcohol content of a barleywine prevents me from drinking more of them, but I also not all barleywines are Aaron."
5801,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.7,Look: Hazy golden orange. Fluffy white head.
5802,Blanc De Blancs,99,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10%,5.0,Had this a few years back at an epic share night with a few good friends. It is as advertised. Chardonnay is really the only wine I like and it made for a great BA beer here!
5803,Appervation,99,Stout - American Imperial,15%,4.35,"2018 release. A: Pours an inky black with a smattering of tan head.  S: Vanilla, a bit of strong ethanol, dry oak, bourbon, dark chocolate, a hint of plum, light roastiness and coffee.  T: First impression is that this is pretty rich and sweet. Tasty melted dark chocolate, bourbon, mild toasted oak and roast, sweet plum, and finishing with a mildly tannic bitterness but balanced by the sweetness.  M: Pretty hefty alcohol warmth that doesn’t overpower the beer. Full bodied with medium-light carbonation.  O: Tasty, well balanced BA stout. Nothing mind blowing, but solid effort for sipping on cold autumn nights."

5805,Trappistes Rochefort 10,100,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,4.85,"Absolutely one of the very best beers I've ever had of any style. Clean and crisp, with many complex subtleties that other have already described better than I could. It does a pretty good job of masking its ABV too, so be careful. As far as quads go, for me it's either this or St Bernardus Abt 12. I can't decide which is better. Both are brilliant. Those Belgian monks know how to party."
5806,Citraquench'l,99,IPA - New England,7.1%,4.37,Thanks goes out to russpowell for this brew. 16 oz. Can
5807,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.09,"2018 vintage. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Served at 49 degrees.  Pour: deep, deep black. 1-2 finger tan head. Recess into a thick, bubbly ring with plenty of clouds and decent lacing.  Nose: not real strong for me but I’m fighting a cold... Sweet roasted malt, marshmallow (power of suggestion, but accurate), bourbon. Some dark fruit.  Taste: really unique. Sweet, but malt or molasses sweet not sugary. Caramel/toffee definitely present. Some coffee/deep roasted malt bitterness balancing the sweetness. Rich milk/dark chocolate mix backing up everything. Bourbon is surprisngly mild. Slight lactose taste/feel.  Mouthfeel: moderate carbonation at first but quickly turns to a milkshake, oily, pillowy feel that is wonderful. Pretty clean finish considering the viscous nature.  Overall: this is my first and I love the look and feel. Nose is ok, taste is really good but I’m not sure if it’s great for me. Lactose taste isn’t my favorite and I get that, at least for the first bottle. Will revisit review on second bottle and after aging."
5808,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.83,"Growler Thanks for opening this with me, DarthKostrizer! Black in color with a small dark brown head. As with most imperial stouts from Cigar City, this one is remarkably thick and viscous, as well as shiny. Nobody makes a better looking stout than Cigar City. This leaves dots of stick and an oily sheen on its way down. A completely transformed aroma, most notably being the lack of chile character that is present in the base beer. That being said, nothing is actually missed, because this smells fantastic. Layers of rich brandy and chocolate stack atop one another, with nearly no unpleasant alcohol fumes. There's some vanilla and wood complementing, but the sweet brandy and chocolate notes combine together remarkably well. The flavor is similar to the aroma, though more complex. Again, layers of chocolates and sweet, earthy, woody brandy play against one another remarkably well, along with some mild roast, and earth. Full bodied, creamy, low carbonation. Decadent. Superb. The best Cigar City beer I've ever had."
5809,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.78,"This beer is a beautiful expression of galaxy which I’ll admit I’m a galaxy fanboy. This is so tasty and the honey only smoothing out the edges of the pine and sweet resin from the galaxy makes it even better. Perfect execution. The only tweak I would make to make it my number 1 beer ever (beats is infinite by monkish, a DDH All galaxy imperial IPA) would be to double dry hop this beer with more galaxy to bring out that grapefruit and grassy taste to the next level. Phenomenal. Best trilltive ever and it’s not close."
5810,Sip Of Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,5.0,"I can still remember the first time I had this. What a perfect name, it really feels like a ray of sun shooting into you. Fruity but not overwhelming, hoppy but not pungent, never overindulgent but never lacking in character. A perfect beer."
5811,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,3.92,"2016 vintage; drank 2/24/17 @ the Yarchives.  Motor oil black appearance.  Minimal tan head; no lace.  Marshmallow, milk chocolate, cognac & mild oak notes in the nose.  Medium thick mouthfeel.  Whiskey & fudge flavors up front; marshmallow & oak notes on the finish.  Bold flavors here, but it was a hint too boozy for me to love. Close but not quite great."
5812,Triple Sunshine,100,IPA - Imperial,10.5%,4.35,Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering half of the top. There’s a hazy complexion. There’s light soapy lacing. The aroma is of citrus with a bit of pine. I’m tasting a wallop of citrus with abut of pine. The mouth is sticky and resinous.
5813,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.23,Poured from a 12 ounce can into a wine glass.
5814,Zombie Dust,100,Pale Ale - American,6.2%,4.42,"12 oz can. Pours orange with tall, long-lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade and bready malt. Body is full and crisp. Herbal hops dominate the palate with bready malt, oranges and grapefruit in the background. Finish is long and dry. Delicious brew."
5815,Vicinity,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.34,"Dated 6/19/19 on the bottom of the can, 6 weeks since brewing. Pours nearly opaque pale straw in the glass with a finger of rocky white head. Nose of nectarine ice cream, mango, candied pineapple, crushed grains, slight black pepper, guava and a distant onion. Taste follows the nose with lots of sweet tropicals. Higher bitterness than normal for a Trillium smoothie with some decent drying. Medium+ sweetness and a low rolling carbonation leading to a soft medium body. A wonderful brew but nothing to freak out about. Maybe I've had too many Trillium brews."
5816,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.49,"A: The beer is very hazy to cloudy pale whitish yellow in color. It poured with a quarter finger high bright white head that left a thin film of bubbles covering the surface, a narrow collar around the edge, and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass."
5817,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,3.68,"Disappointed. The apple brandy didn't work for me with this dark base stout. It was also pretty thin in mouthfeel especially for this brand. I much prefer Bomb!, Pirate Bomb!, or Birthday Bomb! to this one."
5818,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.75,"batch 1 drank on 3/24/2018 split 4 ways into a snifter Look - pitch black, low carb but still a little, thick but not massive lacing, still a lot there"
5819,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,100,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,3.88,"Can dated 10/19/20 poured into a tulip glass. Getting lots of tangerine/clementine and mango on the nose. The flavor is where this one took a weird turn for me - there was a strong vegetal flavor that overpowered everything for me through the mid and finish, kind of onion or garlic... or maybe some parsley (maybe that’s it because I’m not a big fan of parsley). Still really respectable, but not as tropical and fruity as I was expecting. Smooth finish, not too heavy or syrupy, with some lingering hoppy bitterness. This was can #1 of a 4 pack and has been stored cold the entire time, so I’ll definitely give it another shot and maybe see if it changes over time. Sadly, this one might just not be for me and not my fav DDH offering from Trillium."
5820,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.53,"Had a friend surprise me with this, so excited to finally give it a try! Black body with a brown head. Aromas of the barrel fueling the cinnamon, vanilla, and cocoa to decent heights, peppers, rye and oak linger. Taste has the whiskey from the barrel merge well with the caramel, vanilla, cocoa, brown sugar and cinnamon, with the peppers, rye, and oak providing a beautiful contrasting wave. Almost has hints of cola as it warms. Feel is warm and more sturdy than the orignal, but the adjunct textures are dulled a bit, oak is a pleasant backbone. It is wonderful, but I have to admit the orignal abraxas still is first in my heart for the series."
5821,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.56,"Batch 3. Thanks Brian for sharing. Shared from 750mL bottle into a tulip glass.  Pours a lightly hazy straw glowing body with a frothy white head that leaves good retention and lacing Aromas of funk, oak, citrus, green apple, very inviting. On the tongue its crisp and funky, hay and straw, green apple, a little peppery. Very nicely balanced and delicate. Light carbonation and body. I could easily finish a bottle."
5822,Ghost In The Machine,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.09,12 oz. bottle poured into tulip
5823,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.63,"Batch 2 drank in a HF tulip on 10/7/2016 Look-hazy light tan with a hint of pink. Well carbonated but the head fades quickly.  Smell-fruity, tart, oaky, funky Taste-funky, hay, oaky, red wine barrel very prevalent on the back end, nice mellow tart plums shine really well, almost citrusy. Just glorious! Feel-super drinkable, perfect amount of tartness, flavors sit and linger nicely Overall-wonderful. May be a tad underrated as this is just phenomenal. Well done Hill!!!"
5824,Aaron,100,Barleywine - English,9%,4.93,"Appearance - Pours muddy brown with a nice fluffy tan head that quickly settles to a rocky ring. No lacing. Aroma - Tons of brown sugar, bourbon soaked raisins, toffee, oak, caramel, vanilla wow so much barrel. Taste - Rich caramel and toffee, great bourbon and oak, brown sugar, raisins, tobacco absolutely no alcohol other than the bourbon flavors super smooth flavors. Feel - Silky smooth and soft, just the slightest warming slick dry finish. Overall - Just amazing from start to finish, the nose is harsh bourbon and oak with dark fruit but the flavors are very smooth."
5825,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.54,"Absolutely phenomenal beer, and my favorite Trillium IPA (or APA, or IIPA) to date. Had on tap with lunch at the beautiful new (ish) Fort Point location. Beautiful, hazy, golden-orange body of pure juice, soft soft, off-white lacing (almost no head with a to-the-brim pour). Aromas and flavors are absolutely stunning with massive citrus, mango, pineapple, and white grape. Fairly grassy but massively juicy with absolutely no astringency or hop burn. The honey sends it over the top for me, as I like a little extra sweetness in my big IPAs. But there's some honest, resiny, pithy bitterness in the background that keeps things semi-grounded and lingers quite nicely along with the fruit juice sweetness. So many bold notes at play here, and they come together amazingly. Dangerously poundable for an 8.5% beer. Feel is actually a touch thin for a IIPA of this size, but still very smooth and silky. Absolute winner."
5826,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.75,"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a thin white head. It has medium high carbonation. The beer smells of lemon, apples, funk, and a little floral. It is lightly tart, with lemon, pineapple, earthy funk, and floral. The feel is medium. A great Saison from Sante Adairus."
5827,Temptation,99,Wild Ale,7.5%,4.41,"A careful pour yields a slightly hazy gold with a two-finger pure white, dense and creamy head that persists and produces sheets of lace."
5828,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,4.42,"Pours black with a one inch frothy light brown head that big blotches of lacing. Smells of coconut, roasted coffee and roasted malts. Tastes of toasted coconut, medium roast coffee, roasted malts, caramel, milk chocolate and cinnamon. Medium bodied, soft carbonation creamy mouth feel."
5829,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.13,"Can, man. Cloudy pale yellow pour with a white head. Citrusy hop bouquet. Orange and citrus highlights with a serious bitter aftertaste. That being said, it’s really good. Nice body and mouthfeel."
5830,Abt 12,99,Quadrupel (Quad),10%,3.33,"Cerveza de color marrón, con un dedo de espuma de buena retención. Cuerpo y carbonatación media. Aroma a caramelo y ciruela. En boca tiene una parte afrutada pero una gran presencia de sabor licoroso."
5831,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.54,"The color of this beer is really attractive: Very Hazy and Golden Yellow. Moderate citrus and floral aroma but I was hoping for a bit more than I got. Fairly easy to drink for an Imperial IPA, and the flavor really explodes in your mouth. One of the better NEIPA's that I've had, but might be the slightest bit overrated. It just didn't knock my socks off like I was expecting."
5832,Emerald Grouper,99,IPA - Imperial,9.5%,4.22,"A: The beer is relatively clear yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high off white head that quickly died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass."
5833,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,99,Stout - Oatmeal,13.6%,4.44,2020-01-16
5834,Gggreennn!,100,IPA - New England,7.5%,4.6,"Hazy light golden yellow color with white cap and lacing. Citrus forward aroma, pineapple perhaps, the rest a tropical melange with touches of orange zest. Hop influence is herbal and noticeable. Taste is full, smooth, tropical citrus with a velvety texture and light hop bitterness. The herbal hoppiness yet balances beautifully with the citrus. Malt provides fullness and a touch of sweetness yet remains in the background allowing citrus to march forth. Full texture with balancing carbonation. This is really good. It drinks easily like a well balanced Lager yet is something altogether different."
5835,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,3.67,"Small glass from draught @ Zeezicht Breda. I had this before once from draught, which I remember to be superb. This time: Pours a pitch black colour and a beige/light brown head with short retention. Aroma's: sweet, chocolate, boozy. Retronasal: sweetish, cocos, fruity/boozy alcohol. Flavour is moderate sweet, boozy alcohol. Alcohol is rather sharp. Almost full bodied. a bit too alcoholic. Next time will be better again (I hope)."
5836,Saint Lamvinus,100,Lambic - Fruit,7%,4.1,"Cantillon Saint Lamvinus, 7% ABV. Pours a beautiful deep red, with a one finger pinkish head that dissipated while I got a good picture, leaving no lacing. Nose is light grape and wine. Taste is dry wine with some tartness, and not much bitterness or funk. Feel is decent, good carbonation and dry. Overall excellent. I know this is highly rated, but I'm not loving it."
5837,Thicket,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.2,"Blend #2. 2019 release. A: Pours a deep burgundy, nice clarity and effervescence, with a cap of fizzy purplish-pink head that dissipates rapidly leaving a still surface. No lacing. S: Blackberry, grape juice, and light oak effortlessly meld with a medium-light barnyard funk.  T: A bracing, medium-high, Warhead-like sourness that (fortunately) tapers off quickly. Blackberry juice, medium-light sweetness, and mild funk round out the palate.  M: Fizzy, light body with medium-high, crackly carbonation. O: Great fruit character. The acid is a bit higher than ideal on the palate, though I wouldn’t say it crosses the line into “too sour”."
5838,Smooth,99,Wild Ale,6%,4.54,Excellent funk/barnyard/horseblanket/tartness meets a very fleshy subtle fruit forward nectarine quality. Just excellent and something I could sip for hours on end.
5839,Black Tuesday - Reserve,100,Stout - American Imperial,20.5%,4.75,"Not a beer to be trifled with 2018 21% Solo Ruddy black. Small Borge head quick to dissipate. Vanilla, chocolate, bourbon. Very inviting. Swirling fails to raise more bubbles but reveals legs for days. Alcohol vapor continue to deliver olfactory delights.  Smooth at first then roasted fire. Long lasting barrel. Huge body. Definitely a sipper. Incredible experience."
5840,KBS,100,Stout - American Imperial,12.3%,4.94,"Surprisingly dry and non-heady for a 12% beer. The very present bourbon hit on the smell was pleasantly tamed in taste. Oh my my my, this..is a mouthful. Roasted malts and coffee but in a semi-sweet German/Swiss chocolate bar. The burnt and bourbon flavors match perfectly. I waited until 59 degrees and got a 3/4"" head. I appreciate the lack of simple sugars giving this a dryer taste than one would expect. Alcohol is actually well hidden here in my opinion in taste though it is very present in the nose from the bourbon. Big difference. Big body, Curvacious and complex to the 9th. Do this."
5841,Flora,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,4.8%,4.6,Florence is probably my favorite shelf Saison beer from HF so it's no wonder this one is amazing. It takes everything from the regular and amps it up with a nice tartness and oak character. Screams that HF signature funk with a bit of lemon/lime character as well.
5842,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,99,Stout - American Imperial,12.1%,4.41,"Not Shure why some ratings are low. This bottle was from a trade as an extra and stayed in the stash for a while so it has been aged. Definitely not the""hot mess"" I have seen some reviewers describe. Look dark and minimal head Smell cinnamon, chocolate, barrel, pepper. Taste if you don't like hot peppers you will not like this. Spicy with chocolate, cinnamon, hot peppers and a touch of caramel. Feel nice medium thick Overall I would definitely do this again. Great BA stout with some spice. Very close to BA Bomb."

5844,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.88,Thanks goes out to Satchboogie for this brew. My 3800th Beer Review 12 oz. Can
5845,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.66,"750ml bottle poured into a snifter. A: Motor oil black with a short-lived brown head and spotty lacing. S: Brownie batter, fudge sauce, semi sweet dark chocolate, roasty malt. Black coffee. Bourbon ball candy, barrel char, bourbon.  T: Follows the nose. Big wave of chocolate, fudge, and double chocolate cake up front. Blackstrap molasses. Coffee is fading, but there. Bourbon ball candy and a ribbon of caramel. Roasty and a bit woody. Barrel char and oak. Bourbon rides up middle to end. Finish is all barrel and smoke. M: Huge, chewy, weighty, and coating. Ample carbonation prickles at the tongue. Big bourbon warmth. O: One of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts on planet Earth, period."
5846,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.26,"2017 Vintage (had with breakfast on a weekend getaway) Pour - heavy and thick like motor oil. Not much lacing and only a thin tan head.  Smell - Amazing coffee aroma. Slight bourbon aroma as well. Taste - Very sweet up front. Definitely drink this fresh, almost no coffee flavors came through. Very little bourbon as well. Actually tasted like I was drinking Port. Feel - Nice creamy texture. Very chewy Overall - Had 2016 fresh and it was amazing. This one sat too long. Tasted like I have to go to the bathroom now."
5847,Fort Point Pale Ale,99,Pale Ale - American,6.6%,4.32,"Hazy, dirty peach colored body; fair head, white and soapy, lasting. Kaleidoscope of aromas; floral and fruity; mango and dehydrated strawberries; some citrus, orange and lemon. The taste brings more muted esters and softer fruit presence; semi-sweet; citrus; white grapefruit; nectarine; berry-like; fair amount of bitterness on the back-end. Medium-heavy body; crisp ad acidic; semi-dry at the finish. A fine, tasty beer delivering some fine complexity and respectable depth to the palate. Very tasty..."
5848,Keene Idea,100,IPA - Imperial,8.88%,4.64,"Stone fruit and juiciness on the nose give way to grapefruit citrus flavor and some dank , with slight bitterness. One of best DIPAs I've had and Alpine's best IMO"
5849,Juicy,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.4%,4.31,"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep orangey/amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with light retention and some lacing. Aroma of funky yeast notes with some vinous notes of Sauvignon and some oak presence is also detectable. Taste is also a mix of funky yeast notes with some vinous notes with clear Sauvignon notes, some oak and light tartness with no acidic notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Very enjoyable sour with nice wine barrel-aging notes."
5850,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.56,"Appearance - The beer poured a jet black color with a mocha colored head.  Smell - The nose smelled of fresh sweet coffee. There was no bitterness here.  Taste - The nose was the clue that coffee would dominate the profile. Notes of malted chocolate, maple, and toasted marshmallow follow in the profile. The underlying current of coffee continued into the aftertaste. In every sense, this is a dessert stout.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation was low, but there was not enough viscosity to make this feel like a cake shake.  Overall - Tree House definitely can do styles besides IPAs well."
5851,Parabajava,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,14%,4.7,**
5852,Headroom,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.67,"A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. This is a really good-looking NEIPA - juicy, milkshake-like burnt yellow with a near-1-finger white head on top.  S: Nose does NOT disappoint - it jumps out of the glass with a bushel of fruit: pineapple, melon, ripe apricot/peach, a touch of lime.  T: Pretty much follows the nose, with pineapple, ripe melon, mango, tangerine, orange creamsicle, then finishing with a lemon-lime bitterness and key lime pie. The 8% ABV is not noted at all, though I think I'm getting a little warmth in the belly.  M: Medium to full-bodied, creamy feel to this one - more creamy than juicy, if that makes sense. Real nice feel to it, challenges Tree House's best in that regard. O: Phenomenal. A really, really good NEIPA."
5853,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.74,Batch 2
5854,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.91,"It’s exactly what I want my fruited lambic to taste like. Rich flavors that don’t overwhelm the base beer or hide the natural funkiness. Drinks clean and easy, not overly tart."
5855,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.56,L -- Deep golden orange body with moderate haze and two fingers of solid white head produced with gentle pour. Good retention and lacing
5856,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.83,"What a beautiful beer. As soon as you open the can tropical aromas fill the room! Such a beautiful beer, notes of mango and passion fruit were very evident. Balanced by perfect bitterness and a dry finish makes this such a drinkable beer. The hype train is real and I am travelling to destination ecstatcy!!"
5857,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,10%,4.57,"2018 Bottle in a BIF courtesy of MTKATL L: Jet black with a caramel colored head S: Smokey, heavy dark fruit notes T: Smokey and reminent of Black Albert, a better overall representation of a European porter. Very enjoyable, dark fruits. Has a hint of barrel, despite not being a ba stout F: Thick and heavy, surprisingly so for being non BA O: Very happy to have tried this beer, it is a throwback and still masterfully done."
5858,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.65,"First IPA from HF. Absolutely fantastic beer. Super juicy but there is a great balance of bitterness. It pours super, orange-yellow with lots of lacing. It’s creamy and delicious. Almost impossible to tell this is a double. One of the best IPAs I’ve had this year"
5859,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.28,"Canned 4-14-21, enjoyed on 5-10-21. Glowing rich orange color, 1 finger head dissipates to a ring. Aromas of pineapple, white grape, peach, yeasty, earthy, fresh biscuit- not spectacular on the nose, but a good representation of what's to come. On a small sip its nothing special, on a big sip its showing its class. Well rounded and dynamic flavor profile. Medium-low thickness for style, but also toes the sweetness line very well- a good show from the doughy, confectionary, crispy malt profile. If there's any bitterness it shows up in a fresh grassy quality that grows as the beer warms. Fruit flavor is green melon and pithy + the expected pineapple, stone fruit, floral. It's a very good beer but not the best DNEIPA I've had recently- I'm sure it pops a little more when fresher than this. Upstaged locally in Michigan by HOMES and WaxWings."
5860,Heavy Mettle,100,IPA - New England,9.3%,4.46,"Pours a bright and hazy yellow. A finger of soapy white head. Solid retention, some lacing. A dense haze leading to minimal light penetration.  Nose is sweet peach, citrus, grass, melon and grapefruit. Melons along the lines of honeydew and cantaloupe. Very nice cornucopia of fruits. Nice sweetness with a good balance of grassy hop presence.  Taste is similar. Peach, citrus, and melon, and a relatively strong weed dankness that wasn't as present on the nose. Also it could just be a phantom effect but I get brief moments of raspberry. Medium bitterness, almost reaching something on the higher side of what you'd expect on a NEIPA. mild to medium hop burn as you drink, building on the back of the throat. Very mild cracker malt backbone. Barely shows up and is overwhelmed by the fruit, weed, and grass presence.  Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied for a NEIPA. Mild carbonation. The hop bitterness and alcohol level, makes this brew feel a little more harsh and bubbly than it actually is. Overall an enjoyable NEIPA. This one is a big boy. Juicy, sweet, and dank. I personally preferred Cutting Tiles, but there is still many Trillium IPAs to try and I look forward to future entries into this brewery."
5861,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.39,"16oz. can into Night Shift stemware.  Nose is lactose, chocolate, espresso, roasted malt and molasses sweetness. Nicely aromatic. Beer opens with notes of chocolate, coca cola, molasses and lactose. More molasses and hints of roasted malt, vanilla and espresso in the middle with a heaping dose of sweetness. Finish is coffee, chocolate fudge and a sprinkle of roasted malt bitterness. Terrifically balanced. Medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation. Smooth and rich on the palate but with some playful bubbles going down. Sticky, messy, lingering finish.  This is impressive as ever. A fantastic example of the style..... but as a Tree House stout... just par for the course."
5862,Schaarbeekse Kriek,99,Lambic - Fruit,6%,3.96,"October 2008 Vintage. Strongly colored from the cherries but it has a murky, dark garnet color which isn't the most appetizing. Minimal carbonation and no real head or lacing. The cherries have surely mellowed over time but they're still very much present and seem to have a more earthy flavor, presumably from the addition of the Schaerbeekse cherries. Acidity is very strong and it's quite puckering at times but never gets over the top. A nice beer but it didn't quite live up to my expectations."
5863,Ephraim,100,IPA - New England,10%,4.78,"First time trying Ephraim, poured from growler 1 day after being filled into tulip glass. Opaque hazy golden color, decent head, retention, and lacing. Tropical fruity nose and taste, and smooth full mouth feel. Easily in the same league as Abner, Susan, and SS 4&5. Outstanding!"
5864,Notorious Triple IPA,100,IPA - Imperial,12%,4.31,"Sampled at cophenhagen beer festival in Boston, MA. Pours a clear yellow-orange body with little head or retention. Aromas of pine, citrus and dank herbal hops. On the tongue is resinous, piney hops and an easy finish. Medium carbonation and body.  Good west coast style"
5865,Citra,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.81,"Best IPA I've ever had. I waited years to finally get a case of Citra and the wait was worth it. Scary drive to the brewery to pick up the case, but it was a fantastic trip. Numerous great beers but Citra stood out. Actually, they had ""Hazy Citra"" on tap and it was wonderful. If you get a chance to try it, don't pass it up."
5866,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,3.81,"16oz canned 11-17-20, opened 1-10-21."
5867,Heady Topper,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.15,"Finally had a chance to taste this. I wasn't disappointed, just a great beer. It had a bit more bitterness than I was expecting. Would love to have it fresh from the brewery to see if my thoughts would change."
5868,Sosus,99,IPA - Imperial,7.8%,4.47,"Packaged 8/20/20. Not even a month old.  Pours out a clean and clear looking yellow. In the glass its a mildly hazy yellow color. Some haze, but not gravy looking. A finger and a half of soapy, foamy white head. This looks really nice.  Nose is not very strong. What I get is citrus notes. Tangerine mainly. Very mild tropical notes. But what really takes the lead is the piney, weed like scents. Not strong, but stronger than everything else.  Taste is a lot of that pine and weed dankness. The initial impact is solid, but not overwhelming. That resinous quality persists throughout, but it is kept under control. The citrus sits underneath. A mild undertone. The flavors are balanced and delicate. There is nothing aggressive about this brew. Mild to medium bitterness, almost no hop burn, no flavor overstaying its welcome. This is such a smooth and casual drinker.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild to medium carbonation. Wow. This mouthfeel suits this brew perfectly. Its just...how can I say it? Light, comfortable, drinkable, smooth. It just fits. It practically drinks it self. I finished this a little more quickly than I thought I would. The drinkability on this one is crazy.  Overall? I mean...this is not a jooze bomb or an over-the-top hazy. But this takes strides in showing how important balance is in a brew. Using just Mosaic, Toppling Goliath has crafted a wonderful, casual drinker. If I could find this more readily available in my area this would be staple material. It would sit on my shelf next to Green and 90 Minute anytime of the year."
5869,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.65,"05/2016 - this is fucking incredible. Cinnamon, tart acidic cherries; slightly sweet, very fruit, and only a light amount of acidity; great funk, oak, and barnyard in back; clean and delightful."
5870,Bad Boy,99,IPA - Imperial,9%,5.0,"Look: straw, pretty clear golden yellow. semi thin white head. Smell: fresh hops and god's vagina Taste: best part of this beer by a landslide. how is it 9% ? nobody knows. well, at least i dont.  Feel: perfect mouthfeel for a beer of this style. Medium, maybe slightly medium plus. Overall: more people should try this beer. It's the best hoppy beer / imperial IPA in CA, and probably whole West Coast. Thank goodness it was available a few days ago when I visited SD and this brewery for the first time. This beer is epic. just drink it and you will know."
5871,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.88,"2015 bottle (Blend 5) - deep lipstick red with a thin white/redish head that quickly goes away. Smell is heavy raspberry with a little funk. Was somewhat let down by the lack of farmhouse funk smell. Flavor follows. Overall a superb beer, just may have aged a touch too long. At nearly three years old, I think this maybe aged 4-6 mnoths too long."
5872,Last Snow,99,Porter - American,6.4%,3.24,"The aroma is downright intoxicating when it comes to coconut qualities - this really does smell like a liquefied Mounds bar! Coffee, roasted malt, and (of course) dark chocolate all offer a nice ballast to the coconut. One niggle: the additions are so bold, they overpower the porter backbone somewhat. This beer is a total showstopper on the taste buds...well, at least for the first few sips. Apart from a slightly roasted opening, coconut utterly dominates in the best/worst way around the middle and end. Coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors, just like the aroma indicated. Speaking of how it ends, the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it - there's that ""so sweet, it's somehow bitter"" sensation I get from a select few dessert beers (like Creme Brulee from Southern Tier...or Maple Bacon Coffee Porter from Funky Buddha themselves!) At the end of the day, the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose. Plus, it feels thin and angular - not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness. Said extreme sweetness ultimately chokes the drinkability factor. Carbonation is medium high. I do enjoy this more than their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, but eh. I don't need to have this again either way. 3.24/5: Syrupy and absurdly sweet - perfect for the hypetrain crowd!"
5873,Hypermash Hydra,100,Stout - American Imperial,13.54%,4.76,"It’s glass-coating thick.. super dark, tan head. Looks like it’s from a whole different brewery. Beer is insanely balanced. Coconut and cinnamon dominate, but the black-roast coffee finishes with a dark chocolate, dry bitterness. So many strong flavors fighting for supremacy, yet they all cooperate, and achieve near perfection."
5874,Julius,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,5.0,"At a post Labor Day backyard pizza and beer night, Julius turned heads. A deep orange body, half inch creamy foam, the aroma entices with late summer peach/nectarine citrus notes. So smooth... refreshing mouth feel! The balance makes this mouth watering and ever so memorable."
5875,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.2,"2016 batch (#2) reviewed. Hunahpu's is one of those beers that I loved the very first time I tried it, and I've been chasing that dragon ever since... unsuccessfully, as it turns out. I've been lucky enough to try Barrel-aged Huna twice now - once at Great American Beer Fest, and for a second time when I won a bottle in a charity raffle. As it turns out, I drank my BA Huna alongside of Double Barrel Huna, expecting that I would be blown away by the Double Barrel... in fact, it was the exact opposite experience. And perhaps I should have expected that, given the barrels used in DB Huna - Rum and Apple Brandy barrels don't often tend to impart much thickness to a beer, and in combination, they definitely made the beer seem a bit thin. Additionally, where the bourbon barrels in BA Huna add depth, richness, sweetness, and complexity, it seems that Double Barrel just took on thinness and acidity. It's also quite charred in taste - it reminded me quite a bit of my gripes with 2018 Huna. Sadly, all of that cinnamon and vanilla that I love seemed to be entirely absent. It's still a sweet beer, but it's greatly overshadowed by the barrel notes and char and acidity. In the end, I honestly think I've found myself preferring non-barrel-aged Huna as my go-to. It's certainly easier to get, and something about it is just a much more pleasant experience for me. Yes, I have a sweet tooth, so that's probably a big part of it. Or perhaps Cigar City's aging methods just aren't to my liking. Maybe the barrels? Tough to say - more experimentation required!"
5876,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.21,"No canning date spotted, but I purchased this 5 days ago. A: Pours a lightly hazy pale sort of orange I guess? Tall frothy light tan head. Great head retention and lacing.  S: Interesting. I was expecting a huge aroma but it's pretty subtle. Citrus, pine, tropical fruits along with some malt sweetness.  T: While the aroma was a bit underwhelming, the hop character in the taste is ridiculous. I think they put every hop in here. It's piney, garlicky, spicy, citrusy...tropical? It's not TOO over the top but there are a ton of hop flavors in here. Bitterness, yes, but not crazy. I honestly have a hard time describing it. It's just myriad hop flavors from start to finish. It's a little different sip -to-sip as well.  M: Fairly heavy, quite dry. O: It kinda reminds me of Devil Dancer to be honest, but perhaps just better overall. Not as sweet, not as insane, better balanced. Don't get me wrong, still a ridiculous amount of hop flavors in here. It's like a joke beer that actually turned out really well."
5877,Society & Solitude #5,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.33,"Got it fresh at Hill , excellent beer..... great taste very smooth ... sweet finish, touch of honey... cirrus overall slight bitter ...... will be having again"
5878,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,3.97,Batch 2
5879,Consecration,100,Wild Ale,10%,4.55,"The smell and look are perfect. You know that there will he so much going on that it makes me excited to drink it. Flavors of cherry, vanilla and a tartness won’t make your face crinkle but lasts in a good way. Hides the alcohol very well. Smooth and full mouthfeel, with the right amount of carbonation. Bottled 12/16/16, so some good aging. Love this beer!"
5880,Blessed,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.44,"From Tavour. Refrigerator kept since purchase. Not as thick as some describe. Pitch black, and silky except for the coconut floaties, which for me detract some from the appearance. Smell is divine - what I'd imagine it might smell like inside the factory where they produce Mounds candy bars. Taste almost matches the smell, except it is a touch too sweet, and lacking enough barrel heat to balance it out. Overall, I need to knock it down only because the drinking experience doesn't meet the price of entry. Considering that, I'd be much happier with a 750 ML bottle of Shared Coconut Vibes."
5881,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.94,"Look: oil black, thick khaki head with gorgeous lacing"
5882,Atrial Rubicite,100,Wild Ale,5.8%,4.0,"Not my favorite style but I still enjoyable. Pours ruby red with dark pink head. Smells of tart raspberries. Taste is sour raspberries, very sour to my taste but classic to style. Bubbly and refreshing. I have two more bottles that will be enjoyed best during a hot afternoon on the porch. Won’t seek out again for the price and effort."
5883,Last Buffalo In The Park,100,Porter - Imperial,11.5%,4.75,"I love Last Snow. Unfortunately while in the Tampa area this past March there was none that I could find. This beeer is courtesy of my friend and BA icon @DoctorZombies. Thank you my friend. There is only one rason this beer does not get a 5 and that is because no beer is perfect. This is damn close.It may be a touch on the sweet side but it just works. Oh, if only I had a cellar full I would be giddy !"
5884,Wide Awake It's Morning,100,Porter - Imperial,10%,4.04,Looks exceptionally creamy. Doesn't smell much more involved than Founders breakfast stout or peche mortel. Taste it shines. Lots and lots of maple. Though not a lot - the evident hop presence is extremely uncondusive to the character of this beer.  M - rich and foamy. Good stuff. Overall I dig it. Not blown away by it but it's solid. Wouldn't put it in the top 250 and can't see myself revisiting it but worth once I suppose.
5885,Hommage,100,Lambic - Fruit,6%,4.52,Solidly intense nose with luscious fruit and an ample amount of acidity. I'm glad it had cherries otherwise it may be too one-dimensional. Mouth feel had great balance and tart fruit.
5886,SR-71,100,Stout - American Imperial,14%,4.74,"What an amazing nose that lingers well after I've stopped smelling; supremely luscious body, with the flavors lingering for a while too; the finish is boozy yet controlled, balanced, and well executed."

5889,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,5%,4.43,"2013 vintage drank out of a chalice on 3/19/2016 Funky and tart, but not overly tart at all. Very refreshing and tons of crisp apple and grape flavors. Well balanced with some grassiness and nice oak as well."
5890,Triple Shot,100,Stout - American Imperial,9.7%,4.45,Batch 1000! Smells like cold brew coffee and chocolate. Medium thick mouthfeel. Tastes exactly as it smells. Tons of coffee on the aftertaste. It’s fantastic.
5891,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.45,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy golden color capped by a one finger head of foam; scattered lacing Smell: Fresh mowed grass, crusty bread, green apple, vinous oak, barnyard funk and a rustic yeast character Taste: Green apple and lemon rind forward, with a vinous oak barrel flavor building; underneath, there are tones of fresh mowed grass, crusty bread and barnyard funk; through the middle, the flavors grow increasingly tart with a rustic, spicy yeast character  Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation Overall: The more this beer warms the more interesting it gets Thanks, OakvilleKGB, for the opportunity"
5892,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.34,"Pours black as sin and thick as oil. I can feel the viscosity as I pour it from the bottle. Small fuzz of dark brown head settles pretty quickly to just leave an oily black substance that I wouldn't let Lt. Yar stand next to.  Nose focuses in on the adjuncts really nicely. The stout underneath has kind of a black licorice lean to it and a roastiness that's almost more carob than chocolate. The peppers lend a subtle vegetal-ness which I think age has nudged the coffee towards as well, while the cinnamon and pepper do a good job of adding depth to some of the sweetness as well.  Flavour is a nice blend of the same elements: The licorice and the vegetal (pepper and coffee) character work together in similar hues, while the cinnamon and ancho and play well together, the chocolate and the underlying stout get along well. The oily impression from the pour is not refuted in the experience. Thick and oily and smoothe with a nice bright carbonation to offset that a little bit, I dig it. This is up my alley. I'm not always big on overproduced stouts or a lot of adjuncts, but this is an example of where I think it can be done really well. "
5893,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.75,"(2015 vintage) I'm not a lover of the dark fruits character that tends to result in aged dark beers but that's what i got. Suffice to say, the taste was the most mellow that I've ever experienced. Like a fine wine, it did keep some of its Belgian Quad character and it was outstanding."
5894,Lou Pepe - Kriek,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,3.97,"Carnivale Brettanomyces 2019. Small size sample from bottle in de Bierkoning, Amsterdam, poured by the man himself: Jean Van Roy. 2014 label, bottles 2016. Pours a lovely deep red/purple-ish colour, slightly hazy, and a dense pink head with good retention. Aroma's of cherries and almonds/fruitstones, sour & sweetish. No sweetness retronasal. Flavour is sour, with light dry bitterness. Light bodied. Long finish, tart and dry."
5895,Susan,100,IPA - American,6.2%,4.49,"Appearance: Pours a rather cloudy orangeade color with a two finger head; solid persistence and streaks of lace Smell: There are both grassy and floral tones here, with stone fruit and lemon in the mix Taste: The flavors here are subtle but bring an interesting spectrum; stone fruit and passion fruit are featured, with a lemon aspect; the bitterness builds nicely but is held in check so that it doesn't overwhelm Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation Overall: A very nice IPA but the progeny has boosted this to the top of the IPA charts; not saying it doesn't belong there but I wonder whether the subtlety would shine as much in a blind tasting"
5896,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.28,"Pours a true hazy orange with two fingers of khaki foam after an eager pour. Head retention is good. Aroma is papaya, orange, mango, guava, pillowy yeast and clove. Tropical fruits are pronounced and sugary. Flavor profile carries more of the same qualities, with papaya, orange, mango, tangerine and guava sitting on the tongue for a long while after each sip. Light notes of yeast, and bready malts round out the flavor profile, but the balance is still very clearly tipped towards hops. Mouth feel is pillowy and creamy with a medium-thick consistency. Overall, sweet, but overly so. It clearly focuses on tropical fruits, but refrains from becoming cloyingly sweet - a refreshing NE IPA characteristic.  Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 12oz can."
5897,Samuel Adams Utopias,100,Strong Ale - American,28%,4.99,"Served in a tiny snifter. Dark amber with no carbonation or head. Smells of a fine tawny port, caramel, toffee. Taste is the same with a hint of vanilla."
5898,The Peach,100,Wild Ale,7.3%,4.65,"Batch 2, reviewed 6/20/17. A: Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with just a thin film of bubbles atop. Has an almost caramel color in the glass, very reminiscent of freshly squeezed peach juice. 8/10 on the opacity scale. S: Punches with funk and peach skin up front. Mushrooms, earth, and a bit of gym locker stank. Meshes very nicely with an assertive peach skin note and a hint of wood. Sweet peach comes out more as it warms, but the blending of the fruit and funk is done damn near perfectly on the nose.  T: Explosively peachy. The perfect balance of funk and fruit is devoid from the taste, which is dominated by an overripe, juicy, almost candied peach flavor. Bright, sticky, sugared up yellow peaches jump out up front, followed by just hints of earth, a touch of rotten fruit skin, and rounded oak-y finish. Wood contributes some vanillin on the finishes, which melds very well with the candied peach flavor to offer a delicious aftertaste. M: Medium-bodied with a soft effervescence and a medium-plus sweetness for the style. Dangerously easy to drink at over 7%. O: Absolutely delicious. Some may complain about the lack of ""complexity"" on the taste, but if you're looking for an expression of peach in beer form, I can't imagine asking for anything more than this."
5899,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,18.9%,4.3,"Drank with 2 years 4 months age on bottle. Nice beer, though I prefer the bourbon barrel better. This variant has a lot of caramel flavor and is slightly hotter than the bourbon barrel. That being said, it's still great. If you're into rum barrel beers, a must try."
5900,Bodhi,99,IPA - Imperial,8.5%,4.53,The best of the 4 beers I tried from this company. Hazy color. Tropical taste. Lots of papya and grapefruit. Finishes Crisp and juicy and overall good feeling
5901,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Old Ale,13.5%,4.19,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Shared with Ryan. Pours a brown muddy translucent but lightly cloudy body with a white head. Aromas of toffee, buttscotch, caramel, old malt, bourbon. Taste matches the nose with tons of caramel and toffee, dark fruits and figs, lightly toasty on the finish. Can't tell it's 13%."
5902,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.81,I had b2 last year and knew I had to get my hands on more. B3 isn't quite as fruity or have the same mouthfeel but nevertheless it's very similar. Best nose on any sour period. Many people comment how you can smell chocolate or coffee or other things and I've always thought that these were more resembling characteristics but this beer really does smell like straight nectarines and nothing else. Beautiful citrus. The level of sour and acidity are damn near perfect. I've had quite a few DeGarde beers and this is hands down my favorite right with Imperial Stone Bu. When I traded for the B2 with the Peach I thought the Peach was a total let down compared to this gem. Totally worth trying at least once.
5903,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,99,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.34,"Typical bright orange pour. Thin head. The nose is heavy tropical citrus. Peach, tangerine, sweet and sticky. Taste is big and bright. You get the tropical fruit notes, more pineapple flavor in the taste than the smell. This one is just through an through bright and fruity and really pretty sweet. Like tropical Starburst in the best way. Not an especially long or complex finish though. Not too much boozy flavor. It kind of blends in and enhances the sweetness. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky but when the flavor is so good, you don't mind. Nice carbonation that enhances the brightness of the tropical fruit flavors.  This is a pretty solid NEIPA. Seems like this one is available fairly often and its a pretty reliable choice. I'll drink it anytime."
5904,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.91,L: Bold onyx and dark brown hues with a thin sandy head
5905,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,4.73,"Syrupy, soft, smooth sipper. Like liquid chocolate cake in a glass. Coffee is there, with burnt caramel and dark cocoa. Sweet, minimal carbonation, sweet and velvety. Boozy in a way, but only because you know the alcohol is there - it's hidden, blending with whiskey tones to make one of the best beers I've ever had. The smell is indulgent and dessert-y, intoxicating. Look is midnight black, just like coffee should be."
5906,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,100,IPA - New England,7.2%,4.61,"L: Super Hazy yellow with a tint of orange and a bubbly head that dissipates leaving modest lacing. S: Bright and resinous tropical fruits. Mango, peach, and pineapple. The malt showcases itself surprisingly well with some candied bread. T: Firm bitterness, moves into a huge hop flavor of mango, peach, and pine resin. The malt provides a decent backbone with some candied crystal malt presence. F: Dry, but somewhat creamy from a generous dose of wheat or oats. Overall: A stellar NEIPA, insanely hoppy. You must try this beer if you are a hophead."
5907,Miami Madness,100,Sour - Fruited Kettle Sour,5.5%,5.0,5's across the board. No doubt about it. This blows all other Berliners I have tried right out of the water.
5908,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,Amazing! Huge chocolate flavor and a huge mouth feel that melds bourbon and oaky vanilla with the chocolate for a heavenly experience. Mod-palate I also get an interesting tobacco flavor. Complex. I love this one and it falls in with the maybe 5-10 beers I give a perfect rating.
5909,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.69,"Reviewing the Apple Brandy-Aged Hunahpu's Imperial Stout from Cigar City Brewing out of Florida. Hunahpu's is Cigar City's most famous stout and it is released at an event that is essentially similar to Dark Lord Day. We cracked this one, in addition to several other big name goodies, to celebrate the end of the Illinois bar exam, my birthday, and Robbie Moy's birthday."
5910,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.63,"2019 vintage. Pours a very dark brown color with noticeable sugars coating the glass. Lots of coffee and maple in the nose, not much barrel or heat at all. Very rich and coating mouthfeel with a lot of layers in the flavor. Coffee, espresso, maple, vanilla are in good balance. Not much bourbon or oak if at all noticeable. Really great beer as it's very hard to pull off this many flavors and layers without a dominant flavor. Just missed it a little with not much bourbon or barrel presence aside from the vanilla notes."
5911,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.7%,4.91,"I really quite enjoyed this beer. First open, pour khaki colored head, lovely bourbon notes and subtle coffee. Taste for me was oak, spice from the barrel, bourbon and roastiness of the stout, not a whole lot of coffee though. I found it to be very balanced and well made, one I will always seek out."
5912,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.36,"Bottle. A: Deep char, complex malt that’s almost toast like, faint oxidation, moderately light bourbon. A: Deep brown color, opaque with Thin off white ring around the glass.  T: Rich, complex malt character that has a toffee and deep brown sugar like character, slightly sweet, slight esters. of dried cherries and raisins, with a light bourbon, vanilla like note. M: Full bodied with moderately light carbonation. Shows a bit of alcohol but is very smooth and not harsh.  O: Awesome; the aroma was solid, but the flavor is superb. It looks super viscous, but drinks thinner and smoother than expected. The rich complex malt flavor is slightly sweet and well compliments the bourbon barrel presence."
5913,Morning Wood,100,Porter - Imperial,12%,3.92,"2018 vintage; drank 4/5/19 @ Yuss Haus Mach III. This was a total maple bomb, with some nice chocolate undertones. It's not subtle, and if you don't like maple you should avoid at all costs...but I found it enjoyable. I'd have another!"
5914,Cable Car Kriek,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.09,"On tap at the Toronado anniversary party. Pours a reddish murky amber with no head and no lacing left on the glass. The aroma is big cherry. There is also quite a bit of funky oak and a bit of raspberry. Quite musty. The initial taste is sweet with big cherry. There is also a bit of musty oak and some raspberry. The finish is funky with some lingering cherry. Medium body. Low carbonation. Quite enjoyable, but I think I slightly prefer the regular Cable Car."
5915,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.6,"22 ounce bottle, 2018 vintage, 11-9-18 stamped on the bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark brown color with about an inch tan head that stuck around for a little while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like brown sugar, caramel, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, oak and dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, with brown sugar, vanilla, dark bread, oak, caramel, bourbon, raisin, fig, molasses and plum flavors. It's a little boozy, and with a nice lingering sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall I think it's a pretty good English style barleywine and a pretty good beer in general, I know I'd buy this again in the future if I get a chance to! $24.99 a bomber."
5916,Fundamental Forces,100,Stout - American Imperial,16.2%,4.49,"500ml bottle. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a dark black body, one finger offwhite head, good retention, no lacing. Smell is boozy vanilla brownie batter; the vanilla bean is more of a slightly processed type rather than the marshmallowy type, it reminds me a bit of french vanilla ice cream if that makes sense. A bit of smoky malt, strong milk chocolate sweetness, cocoa and espresso from the base beer, lots of bourbon. Flavour is essentially a boozy creme brulee with chocolate brownie batter. Super nice in small quantities. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, moderate booziness, with a lingering vanilla bean finish. A really big dessert beer which is nice in smaller quantities, but this big boy will hit ya hard if you're not careful."
5917,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.54,"07/2015 - Amazing aromas of peach, apricot, acidic, funk; sweet, juicy, tart, peach, creamy flavors on the palate; funky, semisweet, millions of peaches all over the finish."
5918,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.39,"22oz bottle. Pours a viscous black color with a half inch of dark brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of Bourbon with fudge, molasses, coffee and earth. The taste is a large amount of woody Bourbon followed by fudge, chocolate syrup, leather, molasses, dark fruits and earth. Leathery, Bourbon finish with some more fudge. Heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Lots of alcohol heat. It's like drinking Bourbon soaked chocolate syrup. Overall, an outstanding BA Imperial Stout absolutely worth seeking out."
5919,Beatification,100,Wild Ale,6%,4.49,"2018 edition, poured into a tulip. A clear bright golden color with a modest white head that quickly settled. Crisp citrus aroma - lemon and orange. Some Brett funky esters and dough as well. The taste was phenomenal. Juicy citrus notes mixed with grassy, funky elements, doughy bread, and earthy elements. Moderately tart and very drinkable. The cherry on top was the elegant oaky presence throughout. Not overwhelming, but enough to easily notice. Exceptional."
5920,Pseudo Sue,100,Pale Ale - American,5.8%,4.43,"A: Pours a hazy pale yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap S: Citrus and tropical fruit up front along with some malt and lighter earthy tones T: Follows the nose. Starts off with some candied citrus and tropical fruit, followed by lighter earthy and floral undertones. Lightly bitter. Finishes with lingering citrus M: Light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation O: A very good pale ale that is super easy to drink. Nice and hoppy without too much bitterness. Definitely worth checking out"
5921,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,4.4,"Garnet-tinted dark brown with a half finger of short-lived tan head that quickly settles into a nice, soupy crown. Huge toffee, some fig, raisin, leather and vanilla-forward bourbon in the aroma.  Sweeter fruit in the first sip than expected: huge cherry, plum, fig, raisin and a touch of apple. It’s joined by loads of toffee and vanilla bourbon. Rich caramel chocolate. A hint of coffee. A strong alcohol bite. Nice bitterness in the finish. Slick, oily feel with just enough carbonation to punch through. Out of this world decadence. Cherry-chocolate-caramel dipped in bourbon. An amazing treat of a beer."
5922,Crusher,99,IPA - New England,8%,4.62,"A: poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass, this looked green coming out of the can from all the hops, orange with a huge white head that lingers leaving good lacing, cloudy with bits S: huge hop aroma, grapefruit, pine, sweet tropical fruits T: bitter pine and grapefruit up front, sweet malt, honey, tropical fruits M: full and sticky  O: delicious with a sneaky amount of alcohol"

5924,Zenne Y Frontera,100,Lambic - Traditional,7%,4.49,"750ml capped and corked Batch 2 SOLERA bottle into 3F stemware. Shared with friends.  Nose is barnyard, hay, cheese, lemon zest, and cobwebs. This is what funk is all about. Super aromatic and crazy funky. Beer opens light funk. I get notes of hay, lemon zest, oak, wet wood, and peat. More hay and cobwebs in the middle. Musty and straw. Lemon and oak at the finish. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Prickly and still lively on the palate and goes down accented and sparkling. Goes down slightly dry with a lingering, filmy aftertaste.  Very, very solid. I'm pretty impressed. Definitely worth having."
5925,King Sue,100,IPA - New England,7.8%,4.54,"tallboy 4-pack, dated best by Sept; it's 6/13 pours a super hazy/milky mellow yellow looking body with a white foam head that has very little retention but leaves behind big swaths of thick sudsy lacing as it settles to a murky cap with thin defined halo aroma is floral, with mango and pineapple taking the forefront, just as it sez on the tin. earthy wings and honeyed malt backbone taste rushes this brew into top tier. it's a juicy, earthy punch of mango with pineapple spritz and a caramel honeyed pale malt backer.  mouthfeel is mid-to-heavy levels of both carbonation and body; the carbo is smoothed out and pillowy throughout, finishing dry and hoppy as hell with a crackling version of the mango/pineapple in the aftertaste that lingers in it's earthy fruitiness.  overall:"
5926,Cable Car,100,Wild Ale,7%,4.57,"2016 vintage drank out of a bottle at Toronado SF on 9/25/2017 Look-minimal head and decent lacing for a sour. Super light and translucent golden body Smell-citrus and Apple and some oak. Not overly complex but really enjoyable Taste-green apple is very strong, oak, I'm guessing this is a WINE oak barrel. Some nice citrus under the main coat of green apple Feel-low to medium tart. Very drinkable. Perfect balance. No booze. Nice depth of flavors. Some medium funk perfectly present Overall-amazing. Glad I pulled the trigger on this one"
5927,Society & Solitude #4,100,IPA - New England,8%,4.43,"Solid double IPA. A bit bitter on the aftertaste for my own personal liking, but the taste is unique given the hop mix and profile. Overall beautiful color."
5928,Duck Duck Gooze,100,Lambic - Gueuze,7%,4.16,"January 1st, 2016 - Ringing in the new year with a resoundingly good (and increasingly rare) sour from Lost Abbey. This treat is a lovely scent with a well toned sourness, and a touch of banana esters that play second fiddle. The central sourness on the tongue is also tuned to perfection, with just a slight edge twisting the salivary glands and a lovely carbonation. Each sip is its own little rollercoaster of dramatic joy followed by the post-dopamine relief in the aftertaste, cycled again with a new and fresh flavor."
5929,Flora Plum,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5%,4.63,"Juicy ripe plums picked and appropriately timed to perfection in this beer. Incredible nectar and plenty of gleeky-sourness to it without the harsh finish, very smooth on the way down. This is hands down one of the very best fruited saisons I've ever had the pleasure to try. The pour is a hazy yellow trillium ipa with minimal lacing around the edge of the glass. Aroma is intense with fruit, something unique about the funk... it's not overwhelming but reminds me for some reason of a Russian River sour. The way the sweetness lingers through the finish and the smooth mouthfeel ends with no puckering, this thing is awesome."
5930,Affogato,99,Stout - American Imperial,13.3%,4.62,Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Aroma is a coffee and vanilla blend that is very nice. Taste is a very pleasant coffee with vanilla accent without any alcohol aftertaste.
5931,Society & Solitude #6,100,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.61,"Look is a hazy orange color with a small off white head that is sort of thin and leaves quickly. Decent lacing. Smells of orange, tropical fruits and mosaic hops.  Taste is a great mix of mosaic hops with orange and pineapple notes. Superb feel on this one. Full-bodied and a nice dry finish. Another excellent overall beer here."
5932,JJJuliusss!,100,IPA - New England,6.8%,4.65,"Canned 1/29. I get the love for this beer-it’s great, but I wasn’t blown away. I think the best things about this beer are the bitterness and the subtlety of the juicy citrus. It’s so subtle I’m wondering if it’s fallen off, as it’s promoted as super citrusy. It has juicy citrus notes with orange and grapefruit prevalent, but the tangy fruit flavors balance well with a strong piney bitterness. Medium bodied, smooth, easy sipper. Great beer, but I can’t believe I’m under rating a beer this good."
5933,Double Barrel Jesus,99,Stout - American Imperial,12%,4.6,"Pours thick and black with a touch of light brown head. Complex nose.....fudge, whisky, leather, raisin, plum, roast, oak, and bourbon. Taste is very balanced.....I think the extra time in the barrels really cuts some of the sweetness that is typical in many evil twin offerings. Feel is thick and velvety with low carbonation. By far my favorite ET stout to date....."
5934,Everett Porter,100,Porter - American,7.5%,4.99,"Yeah, this was my first HF beer. After trying it, I must admit that I understand why people consider HF the best brewery in the world. Here goes: "
5935,Pliny The Elder,100,IPA - Imperial,8%,4.14,"A generous share from Erland. Pours out to a slightly hazy pale straw yellow, forming a rocky white head with very good retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate. The nose is mostly pine and then some grapefruit. A little bit of cat pee. Mouthfeel is prickly and lighter bodied than given the ABV, so I suspect white sugar is added here to thin this out. Flavor again is pine and grapefruit. Not overly complex with a firm bitterness and a dry finish. 15 years ago, when there wasn't an absolute deluge of IPAS/ DIPAs on the market, I could see why this gained some notoriety. In todays market, it pales to the abundance of choices. Growing up in Michigan where two hearted is the norm, the same thing has happened here. Still a great beer, but in the broader context, middling at best. This is a good thing though."
5936,Assassin,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,Surprise on tap at brewery July 26
5937,Nectarine Premiere,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.1%,4.67,"2016 vintage, poured into a taster. Huge stone fruit, as expected, well balanced with the wine barrel notes and typical dG funk. Very nicely done overall."
5938,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,99,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,6.5%,4.25,"Definition of 1 dimensional.  A reasonably sour, golden ale with oak notes. Overall quite nice, but nothing to write home about. Would buy again, though probably only 1 bottle As a side, everyone else kept saying how balanced it was, however i get none of that. To me it was just a very tart saison, or a light american wild"
5939,Omega Point,99,Barleywine - English,10%,4.42,"Look: Medium brown leaving the bottle. Dark brown in my favorite 15.5 oz brandy snifter. Bubbles on the top that quickly disappear to a non-head, then to a halo that is less than dress shoe lacing thin. Dense legging with no lacing. "
5940,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,100,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.47,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter glass. Thanks Ray for the share.  Pours a deep brown body with a pretty big, frothy brown head that leaves nice retention and lacing.  Aromas are fudgy with lots of cocoa and bourbon. Taste is fudgy as well, chocolate brownies with bourbon syrup, vanilla, and a bit of spiciness on the backend. Medium-heavy body."
5941,Framboos,100,Lambic - Fruit,5%,4.3,I had the 14 (no carb) but still a wonderful beer to try. Still very delicate and fruity even if the stillness of the beer can be a bit distracting if you're looking for something more effervescent.
5942,A Deal With The Devil,100,Barleywine - American,17.3%,4.98,Perhaps the best beer I've ever had in my life. A step above some of the big hitters like BCBBW. Sampler out of bottle. A big thanks to MIke for sharing.
5943,Chocolate Rain,100,Stout - American Imperial,19.6%,4.44,"2015. Teku pour. LOVE black tuesday but every other variant hasn't lived up to it yet. Hoping CR is the outlier. L - thin murky brown like BT S - alcohol and dark fruit. I smell zero of its proclaimed additions and honestly it just smelled like a less pronounced version of black tuesday. Disappointed here. T - mmmkay. I see you chocolate rain. Massive amounts of milk chocolate overtop of black tuesdays dark fruit and ethanol. Chocolate covered cherries and plums washed down with faintly oaky, and mildly vanilla liquor. Not identifiable as bourbon, and almost more rum like due to its sweetness. F - dry. Creamier than I believe black tuesday was. Hot (obviously). O - hands down the best variant. I'd have to try it side by side with BT to decide which I like more but it certainly is better than grey monday, pb and thursday, and the worst them all... mocha wednesday."
5944,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.38,"Great beer, but I have to say for the value and what I gave up to get this I would rather go for the non ba version. Great beer, where I think the bourbon barrel actually does not add a lot cause there are so many adjuncts. Definitely a chocolate bomb. Gets points because of Angry Chair's dark lacing and overall turbid, oily, thickness that makes it a unique beer."
5945,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),100,Quadrupel (Quad),10.2%,4.64,"2 fingers of khaki head which slowly dissipates to about one finger. Dense foam which leaves a surprisingly nice amount of lacing despite the abv. Body is translucent amber-brown. Nose brings sweet dark fruit, pumpernickel bread, caramel, a touch of earthy cocoa and leather. Well integrated. Fruit forward but not perceiving it as cloying. Taste bring sweet dark fruit - both fresh (juicy) and dried - followed by additions of some earth and leather. Well layer. Middle heats up a bit - picking up on the abv but it's pleasant. A sharp spiced/peppery note. Finishes with more fruit, but it's less dominate. Earthy cocoa notes and leather. A balance of bitter and sweet. Full bodied, but not oily or cloying. Picking up on the abv more as it warms, but it adds some depth.  My recollection of other quads is fuzzy, but from what I do remeber the richness/juiciness of the dark fruit notes distinguishes this from other of the style. Like other trappist quads, this is incredibly well balanced. What impressed me is that the balance leans slightly toward the dark fruit notes without becoming overly sweet/cloying. At $20 per, I don't regret the splurge, but I won't be repurchasing when St. Bernardus and Rochefort and readily available at half the price."
5946,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,99,Stout - American Imperial,11%,4.14,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Bottled 10/14/20, had 6/16/21. Pours an opaque dark brown, with a one and a half inch foamy head and some foamy lacing. Aromas of fudge, fudge, fudge, coffee, chocolate, malt, some vanilla. Has a sweet aroma. The flavor also starts with fudge- not as much as the aroma, coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, some vanilla, bourbon as it warms, a hint of maple. It’s fairly sweet and there’s some bitterness on the finish, an odd bitterness. Mostly smooth, a very good but slightly thinner full body, well carbonated.  It’s certainly good, with fudge for days- great aroma, but the barrels are pretty light and the maple is a rumor. Not as complex as the OG, and it lacks the overall richness and barrel impact."
5947,Very HHHazyyy,99,IPA - New England,8.8%,4.46,"Canned 03/30/21, it pours cloudy orange color with a foamy 2 finger thick off-white colored head that was packed with bubbles of all sizes, dissipating very slowly and leaving good spotty lacing coating the sides. Smells of orange peel, lemon zest, grapefruit, yeast, candy sugar, tangerine, wet wheat bread, grass, floral hops or herbs, biscuit and tropical fruit. It had a much softer aroma than I expected and didn't jump out of the tulip glass. Tastes of tangerine, orange, grapefruit, orange ring candy, peach, lemon/lime, guava, biscuit, lemon, tea leaf, pineapple that is about to go sour, melon, very faint brown sugar, tropical fruit and fresh cut grass. It has an aftertaste like it was dry hopped and brings out different fruity flavors with each sip. Pretty damn smooth for 8.8% ABV, it had a low level of bitterness that made for a nice easy drink."
5948,It Was All A Dream,100,Stout - American Imperial,17%,4.23,"Oily black with a surprisingly persistent creamy but thin mocha blanket. Maple brulee and mocha roast are accented by sweet dark fruit and a little waxy oak via a crackly medium-light body that finishes semi-sticky with a mild heat. I wasn't floored by this one, especially considering the hype behind it, but I had a few other beers this night that kind of trounced IWAAD. The complexity was lacking, and so too was the pastry decadence--I figured there'd at least be an explosion of one or the other. I guess on one hand you can say, then, ""it's balanced,"" but it wasn't quite there either. Pretty sweet with some heat, and a mostly mild maple character, I was surprised there was so little coconut--I got a couple of pours to be sure."
5949,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,99,IPA - New England,6.2%,4.38,An exceptional IPA that stands out above a sea full of IPAs. Love getting my hands on this beer. Love me some fuzzy baby ducks! This is a beer everyone needs to try at some point.
5950,Mother Of All Storms,99,Barleywine - English,14%,3.96,Bottle Date: 2017
5951,Parabola,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.65,"12oz bottle into an odd shaped glass. 2021 release. Looks outstanding in the glass. Jet black body with an initial generous tan head. This shrinks to a faint ring, leaving scattered lacing. Aroma of smooth boozy barrel aging with a little chocolate. On tasting, this beer is triple aged in barrels. Normally the booze element would be overpowering, especially in a recent release. "
5952,Rare Scooop,100,Stout - American Imperial,,4.64,"Scooooooop!! Great ice cream beer - was surprised to get as much strawberry flavor as I did, with vanilla coming through more as it warmed. Chocolate was almost an aftertaste."
5953,Second Fiddle,99,IPA - Imperial,8.2%,4.18,"16oz can.  Pours clear gold with an average head, retention, and lacing. Pithy grapefruit with dank pine in the nose. Subdued for the style. Medium bodied with a crisp but creamy mouthfeel. Grapefruit, pine, and faint orange oil on the palate. Finishes firmly dry and bitter with lingering grapefruit, a trace of malt, and a mild booziness."
5954,Hold On To Sunshine,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.6%,4.82,"We opened this can last night, with temps in the 60s, the kids tending to the fire pit, and the air crisp. We threw around some slices with IPAs earlier, then settled next to the fire to roast marshmallows and sip this stout. It poured a dark wood charcoal color, with hints of amber around the edges. The head made a brief presence then ebbed away. The aroma wafts out of the tulip glass with delectable coffee and chocolate notes; “pass just the marshmallows please, I have all the chocolate I need.” The stout swirls deliciously and the milky sweetness combines with the carbonation to give it an ice cream float profile to the taste. When treehouse says coffee, they mean it! What a treat!"
5955,Doppelganger,100,IPA - New England,8.2%,4.61,"Look... i mean ""damn the sh%t looks like juice"" what neipas look like"
5956,West Ashley,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.3%,4.19,"Frankly, this beer is too sour for me. However, taste, feel, and overall, I think thanks a great beer. When you taste this beer, you will taste a deep apricot funk"
5957,BDCS,99,Stout - American Imperial,10.2%,4.36,"12 oz can from Buckeyeboy. First Arkansas tick! Pours out black, tiny islands of tightly beaded bubbles. Oily and slick. Aroma is sweet, vanilla, chocolate, marshmallow, coffee. Taste mirrors the aroma, creamy and thick. Alcohol noticeable at the back. Smooth, tasty."
5958,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,10.5%,5.0,"L: Jet black color, minimal head and lacing, no visible carbonation. S: Chocolate, coffee, whisky, alcohol, so much complexity! T: Chocolate, coffee, whisky, alcohol. The complexity of this beer is out of this world! F: Full bodied, thick, full flavored. O: One of the best (if not THE best) imperial stout I have tried. World class."
5959,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.83,Would I buy this again? I would buy the full allotment! Literally cases if I could get away with it.  Easily one of the best beers Ive ever tasted.  Ive never smelled a better beer.
5960,Westly,100,Wild Ale,8.5%,4.49,"This one pours a hazy bright orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing. This smells like vibrantly sour apricot, citrus, ripe fruit, oak, loads of sour white wine. The apricot flavor just bursts forward here - with tongue-tingling sourness and drippy juiciness - it's so authentic and wonderful tasting. There's a lot of barrel too, wine slathered all over it, with some mildly tempering oak as well. There's also a sort of general sour citrus character, as well. This is light bodied, and pretty high on the sour scale - personally, maybe an 8/10. It's still pretty drinkable despite that. I'm not 100% sure this is better than regular 'ol West Ashley. Nonetheless, it's still a really special beer."
5961,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,7.9%,4.44,"A: Pours a pitch black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap S: Roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, dark and milk chocolate, and a touch of caramel T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of roasted malt, vanilla, and coffee. Picks up the dark chocolate followed by some milk chocolate sweetness. Caramel follows soon after. Finishes with lingering roast and coffee M: Medium-full bodied with low-moderate carbonation O: A very good coffee stout that hits the vanilla nicely as well. Makes for a great sipper. Definitely worth checking out"
5962,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,99,Stout - American Imperial,14.6%,4.53,L: Pitch black pour with no head
5963,Saison Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7%,4.75,"Just another example of Side Project leading the way in American wild ale production. This is b2, and it’s lightly carbed with rich hay, grain, funk and citrus flavors. All blended meticulously with some kick from the wine barrel at the finish. Outstanding."
5964,Coffee Abraxas,99,Stout - American Imperial,11.5%,4.77,"A stellar beer. Dark brown verging on black, a healthy frothy head and lacing. Strong cinnamon, coffee, and pepper scents over a roasty chocolatey base. Well blended mix of all the above adjunct flavors, with coffee in the forefront but everybody playing nicely with each other. Like the regular Abraxas, it’s almost understated in flavor, which works well. Almost light bodied for such a big beer, not oily or thick in the least. Just all around a winner of a beer."
5965,Fuzzy,100,Wild Ale,8%,4.4,"B3 - I have to say I like how this is not as acidic as the other vintages. I mean sure, it’s tart, definitely, but it’s millions of peaches, peaches for free/me/us! Dug it."
5966,Coconut Vibes,100,Stout - Russian Imperial,13%,4.59,"L: pitch black, big frothy dark brown head. "
5967,Coolship Red,99,Lambic - Fruit,6.2%,4.38,"Been hunting this one for years. As Captain Ahab quipped, ""this is what ye have shipped for men! To chase that white whale on both sides of the land, over all sides of the earth!"" Beautiful ruby red pour that glowed in the sunlight, with no head after initial surface carbonation. Smell was the star: deep raspberry both fresh skins and sour insides, beautiful oak full of character, wheat, vanilla, wild flower, wild belgian yeast, apricot, and red wine barrel influences. Taste is way more subtle, but not really any less complex or beautiful, just wanted a little more bite like the belgian lambics do on the finish. Simultaneously vinous, sweet, tart, boozy and funky. Well worth the hunt, but does not compete with the belgian lambics of fame"
5968,Framboise Du Fermier,100,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,8%,4.73,"Wow the smell on this beer is just heavenly. Full of fresh raspberries, full of tartness and sweetness. Basically liquid raspberry in pure sour saison form. Has all of the complex and beautifully balanced flavors and feel from the original, but now has a fresh fruit to star up front. Mouthfeel finish did feel a little grainy and acidic on the end, but I'm just nitpicking at this point."

5970,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,100,Stout - American Imperial,12%,5.0,"Supreme maple OD! Soooo easy drinking & well-tasty. History in the making when finally scoring this one! (for the record, tried both 2019 and 2020 at the same time, the latter one being the best... I think)"
5971,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,100,IPA - New England,8.5%,4.58,"merky af, sludge status. bright white head is fluffy and leaves some nice lace. pleasant aromas of lemon, grapefruit, mango, dankness, pine. palate follows with a candied fruit melange up front - peaches, orange, mango, grapefruit coming to mind. bitterness provided by grapefruity and piney bitterness on the back end, some herbaceous danky notes. the mouthfeel is thick, pretty fluffy but borderline chalkyness as it warms."
5972,Very Green,100,IPA - New England,8.6%,4.5,"Great densely hopped IPA. Really intriguing to let it warm a bit and a little bit of grain and caramel actually come through as the label says. I think I prefer Green, but this is a great ""variant"""
5973,Foggier Window,99,IPA - New England,8.1%,4.62,"L - Golden orange with murky body and less than a finger of white head S - Bouquet of hop juice and tropical juice. Dankness, oranges, mango, peaches, grapefruit, white wine, sherbet, pine. T - Flood of dankness up front. Onslaught of tropical and citrus follows. Great bitter bite with citrus acidity. F - Full, soft, and creamy. O - An example of Monkish being better than New England when it comes to IPA's."
5974,Pliny The Younger,100,IPA - Imperial,10.25%,4.7,"500ml bottle into a tulip. Huge thanks to my friend Scott for hooking me up with this long-time dream beer! L: A finger of dense white foam atop a bright orange-amber body. While far from cloudy by today's standards, there's a good amount of hop haze. Head retention and lacing are excellent, especially for such a big beer.  S: Hugely aromatic, with a complex interplay of citrus and pine. The resin actually takes a back seat for me, with orange and tangerine notes really jumping out. Not much ethanol, but it's definitely a big step up in intensity from PtE, and decidedly more fruit-forward than that classic. I'm a fan, but it's actually more restrained than I was anticipating. I can dig that. T: Hops, hops, hops. The tangerine from the nose pops right away, with herbal/piney resin filling in midway through. Big, flavorful hoppiness throughout. The finish is what really shines, though, as the perfect amount of bitterness combines with an astonishing dryness that somehow manages not to be harsh or boozy in the least. I've never had a hoppy beer this strong that was even in the same ballpark of drinkability. I could happily drink several pints of this. Dangerous, delicious stuff. F: On the light side of medium-bodied with a perfect level of soft carbonation and a mouth-watering dryness. Excellent. O: Through no fault of its own, this beer is almost inevitably overrated no matter how good it actually is. It's very, very, very good. There were elements of it that were truly striking, and definitely put it on the shortlist for best in its style, but at no point did I feel like I was having the best beer of my life, which is pretty much what the pedigree and legend demand for it not to be disappointing. I fully expected that going in, though, so I was much more impressed and appreciative than anything else. PtY is a justifiably famous brew, and I hope to get the change to enjoy it again someday. Cheers!!!"
5975,Fou' Foune,100,Lambic - Fruit,5.5%,4.72,"Clear and gold. Small but satisfactory white head. Smells of all the apricots: fresh, dried, jam, pickled. Gorgeous. Got that medicinal barnyard funk but not too much. Exceptional apricot flavour, but with a certain dank turn towards sea buckthorn and pickle brine. Bone dry and perfectly sour: tart, not heartburny. A fantastic lambic and I can’t wait to drink it again."
5976,Impermanence,99,Stout - Sweet / Milk,9%,4.56,"I've never been a stout fan... until now. The complexity of this beer was off the charts. Overwhelming chocolate flavor, with a beautiful undertone of maple syrup. This synergy of flavor made it perfect as a post-dinner beer. I felt like I was having dessert on a fluffy chocolate cloud, as I licked maple syrup off of my favorite model. Hints of vanilla permeated through my nostrils. A truly unique beer and a truly unique experience."
